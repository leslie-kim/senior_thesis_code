NET SAFETY ‘BELT’ TESTED IN AUTOS,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/01/04/archives/net-safety-belt-tested-in-autos-a-nylon-restraining-device-could.html,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 3 — Tests of a fishnetlike restraining device have aroused the inter est of Federal safety experts concerned about miscarriages in automobile crashes. There is no conclusive evi dence that conventional safety belts cause miscarriages in crashes. But while research continues, the National High way Safety Bureau is encourag ing experiments with alterna tive methods of keeping pros pective mothers from be ing tossed about or thrown from cars when crashes occur. For the 4 million pregnant women traveling by automobile each year in the United States, the bureau strongly recom mends the use of lap belts and shoulder harnesses pending the development of a better re straint system. Both the mother and the fetus are much less likely to be injured or killed when the straps are used, ac cording to bureau spokesmen. Tests of a net‐type restraint system, which could be adapt ed for attachment to present safety belt anchorages in pas senger cars, were conducted last year by Dr. Albert I. King and Donald J. Van Kirk of the Biomechanics Research Center at Wayne State University in Detroit. Monkeys in Tests Pregnant monkey in fitted triangular nets were secured in sleds by anchorages over one shoulder, below the groin and on each of the pelvic girdle. The nets of handstitched half inch nylon straps were design ed to spread the force of sharp deceleration evenly over the major portion of the body. The sleds were accelerated and de celerated by a cylinder and a hydraulic snubbing device. For high‐speed tests, a fifth anchorage over the other shoul der was added to keep the nar row‐shouldered animals from rolling out of the harness. The tests “did not cause fetal injury or abortion, even after multiple impacts,” Dr. King and Mr. Van Kirk reported. “Their preliminary findings,” they added, “indicate that the net restraint system can in crease the probability of sur vival of the fetus.” They also noted that the sys tem “distributed the load even ly across the body of the ani mal and the belt loads at the anchorages were comparable to each other.” If the device should prove to be effective for pregnant wom en, they suggested, “a scaled down version could be used for small children in whom the torso center of gravity is rela tively high and whose pelvic girdle is not strong enough to withstand lap belt loads.” 1967 Report Cited As one basis for the possible need of a special restraining de vice for pregnant women, the researchers cited a 1967 report published by the Highway Re search Institute of the Univer sity of Michigan. More than half of the pregnant women wearing safety belts in 30 au tomobile accidents investigated in that study had miscarriages. However, the cases investi gated are now regarded as un representative by a participant in the Michigan project, Dr. Warren M. Crosby. The cases were brought to his attention by obstetricians responding to advertisements that he had placed in several medical jour nals. Dr. Crosby, an Oklahoma City obstetrician who is a pro fessor at the University of Ok lahoma Medical School, subse quently asked California au thorities to send him reports on all crashes involving pregnant women over a three‐year pe riod. In a recent paper analyzing 200 such cases, he reported that 22 women wore seatbelts and that all of them survived with only one miscarriage. Of the 178 who were not wearing belts, he found, eight died and lost their babies and six others miscarried.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Legislature Will Take Up Leftover Problems of 60's,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/01/04/archives/legislature-will-take-up-leftover-problems-of-60s-education-welfare.html,"ALBANY, Jan. 3—The 1970 session of the New York Legis lature will convene Wednesday to find the problems of the dec ade just past have spilled over into the new one. Two major preconditions es tablished for the 193d annual legislative session — pledges of no new taxes and the fact that there will be 1970 elections have determined for the most part how education, welfare, local government and public fi nance will be handled. Governor Rockefeller and the Republican legislative leaders, all of whom face re‐election this year, have repeatedly promised that there will be no new taxes this session. Indica tions are now that within the existing revenues the Gover nor will present a budget of about $7‐billion, an increase of $600‐million over current state spending. Few new programs are ex pected because most of the nor mal growth in revenues over the year will be used to restore much of the money cut from projected spending for educa tion, health and welfare pro grams at the Governor's re quest last year. All areas got more money, but not as much as had been anticipated. Assembly Minority leader Stanley Steingut has charged that the budget cuts made in 1969 “were made so the Gov ernor would be able to restore them in this election year with out adding new taxes.” In New York City today, the state's “Big Six” mayors chal lenged Governor Rockefeller to restore money to the cities be fore claiming credit for new programs. The restoration of $295‐million in “crippling cuts” in projected spending last year should be made by the Legisla ture, the mayors said. An increase in the state's minimum hourly wage from $1.60 to $1.85, to be effective July 1, will be asked by Gov ernor Rockefeller as part of his legislative program. Other new programs that do not require large amounts of state money immediately are to come before the Legislature this year. They include the following: ¶A promised “full opportuni ties” program offering higher education to those lacking in finances or academic standing —a promise that would initial ly be met by the more efficient use of existing facilities. ¶An increase in the minimum wage to $1.85 an hour. ¶A program of universal health insurance largely to re place Medicaid and financed jointly by employer ‐ employe contributions. This was pre sented to and rejected by the Legislature each of the last three years. Essentially, however, the budget and the session will be dominated by attempts to re store funds cut from local‐aid programs in the 1969 session. Bits and pieces of the Gover nor's program for this year, an nounced, leaked or ferreted out in advance, point clearly in this direction. When Governor Rockefeller appeared before the 1969 Legis lature to urge his current $6.4‐ billion budget, he warned that the normal growth of state spending would require a major tax increase every year in the foreseeable future if prospected spending were not curtailed. He proposed, in addition to the tax increase, a general cutback in all major areas of state spend ing. The Legislature, controlled by Republicans with a distinct conservative flavor (The As sembly majority, for example, is provided by members who could not have won without Conservative party votes) quickly agreed with this ar gument. Welfare Plan Pared Adjustments were made in the welfare program—designed to reduce the over‐all cost and hold down the number of new applicants—which reduced the total outlay in that program by about $125‐million. Recently, the Governor an nounced his support for a cost of‐living increase in welfare payments of about 10 per cent. The total cost of this program Is set at $136‐million. Similarly, changes made in the program of state aid to local education during 1969 reduced the amount of money local school districts had an ticipated in the 1970‐71 school year by an estimated $245‐mil lion. Governor Rockefeller has now announced he will ask the 1970 Legislature to increase state aid to education by $300‐ million. Because of an overlap be tween the state's fiscal year and that of local school dis tricts this program will only require $125‐million in this year's budget. The trend established for these two programs to, in ef fect, restore what was elim inated last year is expected to hold true throughout the bud get. $7‐Billion Budget Seen Present estimates indicate the Governor will propose a total budget of about $7‐billion. Some help is expected in the form of a surplus in revenues over anticipation from the cur rent budget. The Governor has estimated that surplus at around $30‐million to $40‐mil lion, but state Controller Arthur J. Levitt last week said the surplus would reach $100‐mil lion and Could run as high as $200‐million or more. Whatever the total budget, the Governor and the Republican legislative leaders have promised that it will be financed without new taxes. The session will open on a highly political note that should set the tone for the entire stay of the legislature in Albany since both Democrats and Re publicans will be forming their November campaign plans with each major floor speech and party line vote. Under orders from the United States Supreme Court, this session must, by Jan. 30, pass a new map of the state's Congressional districts. Demo crats have already charged that the Republicans are carv ing up the state to suit their own political purposes in private and intend to weaken the Democratic vote in every Congressional District. That argument will dominate the first two weeks of the session. Political pressures during this session promise to be in tense, with the added agitation promised by Mayor Lindsay and other big‐city Mayors. Since his victory in New York without Republican party sup port, Mayor Lindsay has be come more active in a bi partisan effort on behalf of urban areas of the state. He and the Mayors of five other urban areas — Albany, Buffalo, Syracuse, Rochester and Yonkers — have formed for the first time a joint lobby to pressure the state for more financial aid. Mayor Lindsay, who has taken the lead in the move, has made it clear his support of Governor Rock efeller's 1970 re‐election bid depends on how well the Gov ernor responds to this effort. Facing a budget gap in the neighborhood of $750‐million to $1‐billion in New York City, the Mayor's demands will be for midable. He has already taken steps to magnify this urban pressure by hiring as his per sonal representative here this year a former assistant to As sembly minority leader Stanley Steingut, Brooklyn Democrat. The Mayor is also considering a full‐time press representative here to provide a constant flow of comment and analysis on the actions of the Legislature. Unresolved Issues Democrats, under Mr. Stein gut's leadership, have entered a natural alliance with these plans. The tight party control maintained by Mr. Steingut and Senator Joseph Zaretzki will force the Governor to rely on strongly conservative party members that provide his ma jority in the Assembly. A number of issues, all dealt with but unresolved last year, are pending that will require action including the following: Education— A number of education‐oriented programs in addition to state aid to local school districts will demand legislative attention. State aid to parochial schools is becoming an increasingly im portant decision to be made. Though the State Constitution forbids state aid to church‐re lated schools the state is rapidly reaching the point where parochial schools will shut down and drop some 700, 000 students into an already overburdened public system un less some method of relief is worked out. A number of proposals for indirect aid have been de veloped by the State Depart ment of Education which will be considered. Transportation—In wake of the fare increase for New York City commuters, pressure will increase for some changes in the state's response to com muter transportation. Changes in the state law, in agreement with New Jersey, may be con sidered to involve the Port of New York Authority more di rectly in commuter problems of the two states. Abortion — Attempts to change the 87‐year‐old abor tion law, which permits abor tions only when necessary to save the mother's life, have be come a perennial affair. This year's effort is aimed at a total repeal of the law and has gen erated much support among liberal Democrats in both houses. Decentralization — Although the 1969 session passed a final plan for the New York City school system, most aspects of that bill will be reviewed and some changes are expected. A drive is under way now to elim inate the provision that re quires the City Board of Educa tion be elected and to allow the present appointed board to con tinue. Governor Rockefeller has also indicated he will spell out a “full opportunity” program this year that will provide access to higher education to all high school graduates regardless of academic or financial problems. Such a program will have to in clude some considreation of the “open admissions” policy adopted by the City College of New York. The State Board of Regents is pressing for repeal of the antibusing bill pasesd last year to forbid state‐ordered pro grams to correct racial imbal ance in public schools. Since this bill was passed last year at the insistence of the same con servatives on whom the Gover nor will have to rely for votes this year, chances for the re peal are considered very dim. Finally, the Legislature or dered a study of campus unrest last year and the report of that committee is expected to lead to some legislation this year. Generally, however, the ses sion will be dominated by ef forts to adjust state spending without increasing taxes and to do it quickly. Every member of the Legislature is up for elec tion in November along with the Governor and all other major state officers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GOVERNOR TO ASK DRIVE ON RUBELLA,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/01/05/archives/governor-to-ask-drive-on-rubella-will-urge-mandatory-shots-for-all.html,"Governor Rockefeller will ask the 1970 Legislature on Wednesday to set up a state wide program to provide com pulsory immunization shots against German measles for all schoolchildren. In one of the annual “leaks” in advance of the presentation of his legislative program, Mr. Rockefeller's office issued statement yesterday in which the Governor said his program would require the State Health Department to provide aid to communities to get the pro gram started. No cost was mentioned in the statement and that will probably be disclosed when Mr. Rockefeller presents his entire legislative program to a joint session of the Senate and Assembly on Wednesday, the opening day of the state's 193d legislative session. German measles, or rubella, is usually a mild illness in children nut it is highly con tageous, and when contracted by a woman during the early stages of pregnancy can cause damage to the unborn child. Mr. Rockefeller's program calls for the mandatory use of a recently developed vaccine on all children entering school. Other diseases for which in oculation is required are smallpox, polio and measles. Mr. Rockefeller will again submit his program for a uni versal health insurance pro gram to be financed primarily by employer‐employe contribu tions. He has unsuccessfully introduced such a measure at the last three legislative ses sions and last September per suaded the National Governors Conference to adopt a policy statement urging the Federal Government to establish such a program nationwide. Acceptance Doubted Although Mr. Rockefeller re cently rated the acceptance of such a program as high priori ty in the forthcoming session, some observers doubt that a program will be enacted this year. They say that there is no powerfully organized lobby or blue‐ribbon committee repre senting a cross section of com munity interests now pressing for such a program. Mr. Rockefeller will also urge the Legislature to pass measures calling for greater public participation in Blue Cross boards and requiring pub lic hearings before increases or benefit reductions are approved by the state. The Governor will again urge a change in the state's 87‐year‐ old abortion law, which now permits termination of a preg nancy only if the mother's life is in jeopardy. Most of the recommendations in the Governor's statement were similar to those made in a report sent to the Republican majority leaders of both houses a few weeks ago by the Joint Legislative Committee on Pub lic Health. The Republican‐con trolled committee is headed by Senator Norman F. Lent, Re publican of Nassau County.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Japan Is Entering the 1970's With Self‐Confidence Restored and Economy Thriving,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/01/05/archives/japan-is-entering-the-1970s-with-selfconfidence-restored-and.html,"TOKYO, Jan. 4—The Japa nese nation, 100 million strong, has plunged into the decade of the nineteen‐seventies with re vived self‐confidence and a feeling of readiness to tackle any challenge, combined with uneasy uncertainty as to what the challenges might be. Here are a people, jammed into four narrow islands small er in total area than California, who emerged from defeat and devastation in World War II to build themselves the third strongest economy in the world, outranked only by those of the United States and the Soviet Union. The nation that has just re newed its mandate for conser vative leadership blends the feudal past and the space‐cap sule future in weird and won derful combinations, unsettling to the outsider and disquieting even to many Japanese. Here is the only non‐Western nation to be approaching West ern standards of living— last year Japan overtook Italy in 19th plate in per‐capita income —while retaining concepts of loyalty and obligation straight out of some sword‐flashing Sa murai drama. Society is inexorably chang ing in the direction, of greater freedom of choice for the in dividual, greater mobility, loos er family ties. Japanese of the prewar gen eration say they scarcely speak the same language as those who began their schooling after World War II—and some of the newer generation are now finding their way into Parliament and other corridors of power. “Dry” is what older Japanese call their postwar juniors. The term suggests that the person so described decides on a course of action not out of a sense of loyalty or obligation to family or company but on the basis of self‐interest. At the same time—and here in lies the complexity of this society in which a supposedly modern, rational and scientific system of values competes with the traditional and intuitive for possession of the individual soul—the violence and vehe mence of student protests last year may be taken as the mani festation of a deep rebellion against the rationalism import ed from the West and the very “dryness” that the older gen eration associates with the youngsters. The Japanese, closed out 1969 with a general election publicized as setting the na tion's course for the decade to come. Premier Eisaku Sato promised that the course would involve partnership with the United States to safeguard the stability of Asia and the eco nomic growth of the develop ing nations. He has pledged re tention of the security treaty wider which the United States maintains bases in Japan as a deterrent to war in Asia. 32 Per Cent Stayed Away Many of the voters apparent ly agreed with the Premier, for while a considerable number— nearly 32 per cent of the 69.7 million eligible voters—did not bother to cast their ballots, those who did awarded 288 seats in the 486‐seat House of Representatives to Mr. Sato's Liberal‐Democratic party. The Socialists, the major op position party, who want un armed neutrality instead of American bases in Japan, got only 90 seats. The Komeito, or Clean Government party, politi cal arm of the militant Buddhist Soka Gakkai, won 47 seats and the Communists increased their number from four to 14. The moderate Democratic Socialist party won 31 seats, the same number it held before the elec tion. “Yes, I voted for the Liberal Democrats,” a Tokyo taxi driv er said somewhat defensively the day after the election Dec. 27. “I belong to a union and I always voted for the Socialists before, but I've finally given up on them.” “I don't like the security treaty,” he continued. “I don't like the idea of having foreign troops in our country. But I agree with Premier Sato that we must keep the treaty, until we're able to defend ourselves. But the Socialists say, ‘Get rid of the treaty, and then rely on unarmed neutrality.’ What kind of childishness is that?” The outburst, unsolicited, came in response to a question on how he had voted. As the driver's comment in dicated, the election defeat of the Marxist but international ist Socialists, accompanied by the rise of the Komeito and the Communists, mutually, antago nistic but both assertively na tionalistic, suggests that ideal istic unarmed neutrality is fin ally dead as a political issue. Henceforth the major opposi tion to the Liberal‐Democratic policy of partnership with the United States is more likely to come from proponents of armed neutrality, be they leftist or rightist, and of a Gaullist ap proach to international rela tions. For nearly a quarter of a century the Japanese have di rected their energies toward the single‐minded pursuit of economic targets—toward the bettering of individual, family and company fortunes. Achievement Is Sudden With a suddenness that sur prised most of the people here as much as it did the rest of the world, they found that they had attained the second strongest economy in the non Communist world. “Life has improved so quick ly during the last four or five years,” Mrs. Miyo Takahashi said not long ago in her 150‐ year‐old thatched‐roof farm house in a village far north of Tokyo. “It was only the other, day that we bought a motorbike for our son‐in‐law. Before we knew it we also had a car.” The economy is entering its fifth uninterrupted year of boom conditions. Throughout the latter half of the nineteen sixties the economy has ex panded at a rate of 10 per cent a year in real terms; in 1970, the growth will, probably be about 12 per cent. Japan is still a crowded coun try, but since a baby boom just after the war the rate of in crease has steadily declined. In the last decade the population has been growing at about 1 per cent a year — about the same as in most of Western Europe. The low rate of in crease — about 1.2 million births in 1968 — is a result of the wide availability of birth control methods as well as of abortions, which are legal. While the rate of population growth has remained low, there has been a vast migration from rural areas to cities. About 30 per cent of the population is still rural, but in 20 years 80 per cent are expected to be living in cities, mostly in the megalopolis sprawling from Tokyo along the Pacific coast through Nagoya and the Osaka Kobe region. The movement to the cities has tended to reduce the size of the family, which, in turn, has contributed to the increas ing breakdown of the tradition al authority of parents. For many families the transforma tion — some would say the distortion — of life may not be sudden or dramatic but it is pervasive and profound. Articulating the bewilder ment over the changes, a senior Government official recently complained to a visitor that “everyone tells us we are No. 2 in the free world now.” “But, deep down in our bones we don't really feel this as yet,” he said. “Look at the houses and apartments we live in—tiny and overcrowded. Look at the way we go to work every morning—packed into commu ter trains like sardines. Look at our sewers, or rather our lack of sewers; look at our hospi tals, poorly equipped and with not enough beds; at our roads, at our handkerchief‐sized parks, at our traffic accidents, at our problems of pollution and public hazards.” “We have so much to do at home,” the official continued. “Yet every underdeveloped country is going to be demand ing that we do more to help them reach the economic take‐ off stage—and of course, for our own sakes, we have to do it. “If our gross national prod uct keeps increasing at the present rate, our foreign aid in the mid‐seventies will come to $4‐billion. That's a respectable sum—it's more than the U.S. foreign aid appropriations for this year.” In 1945, when the Japanese surrender ended World War II, nearly every city in the coun try had been devastated by American firebombs. The vast empire had shrunk and six mil lion repatriates searched de spondently for jobs. Aid, Luck and Hard Work Large allocations of Ameri can aid, plus the hard work of the Japanese themselves, plus good fortune, such as the boom caused by the Korean war, spurred rapid recovery. By 1960 the gross national product —the total value of goods pro duced and services provided— was $37.8‐billion, while per capita income came to $330. Since 1960 growth has been phenomenal. Last year the gross national product reached $140‐billion and the Japanese economy overtook West Ger many's as the third strongest in the world. In 1970 the gross national product is expected to soar above $200‐billion while per‐capita income will rise to $1,500. What have the changes meant to a family like the Takahashis, who live in Kiyo taki, a village about 250 miles north of Tokyo in the rich rice plains of northern Miyagi Prefecture. “We haven't farmed more than seven and a half acres since the land reform,” Mrs. Takahashi recalled in her ta tami‐matted living room, peel ing wine‐red apples and offer ing them to visitors. “But that has been quite enough to kee us busy. We make about 2 million yen [$5,600] each year from rice alone. Besides this we grow vegetables that we sell through the agricultural cooperative, and we have stud bull.” The Takahashis had 10 chobu of land‐25 acres—until the land reform. The law enacted under the occupation forbade ownership of more than 7.5 acres of paddy land. The Taka hashis, like other landlords, had to sell the excess to the Government at confiscatory rates. Not until a few years ago did it act to compensate former landholders adequately. “I came into this house 30 years ago as a bride,” Mrs. Takahashi said “How I missed my own family. There every thing was easy. A stream ran right by our house and all I had to do was to fetch water from it. But here I had to draw water from the well outside the house. “Now we have a village water system. We have our own electric pump. We have bottled propane gas. My daugh ters can't imagine doing with out these conveniences, but I can remember all the hard work I used to have to do in side the house, besides helping my husband in the fields. “Even today, when we have a television set, a washing ma chine, a refrigerator, I think the improvement I am, most grateful for is the building of the village water system.” Young ‘Never Satisfied’ “But young people are never satisfied,” Mrs. Takahashi con tinued. “We have just two daughters, so we adopted a son—that is, our oldest daugh ter's husband has taken the Takahashi surname and lives with us, not his own parents. “We don't live under the same roof, though, as young couples and their parents used to do in my day. We had to build them a separate two room apartment above our new barn.” Not all farmers have done as well as the Takahashis, who had a good deal to start with, but compared with prewar days there has been a veritable revolution In the countryside. Television sets are common place and some families are even shifting to color televi sion. An electric rice‐cooker which eliminates a time‐con suming but essential task—and a washing machine are stand ard equipment in farm homes. Refrigerators, though less nu merous, are by no means rare. Women still do a lot of the farm work, but with mechaniza tion, better fertilizers and more effective insecticides, farming is immeasurably easier than it was 30 years ago. In fact, the major problem is overpro duction of rice, the price of which is supported. While rural areas are being modernized, urbanization is proceeding apace. Whole vil lages in the hinterland lie empty and deserted or are left with women, old people and children while the men move to the cities in search of high paying construction jobs or fac tory work. Physical change in the cities has been dramatic too. There are skyscrapers, roads are be ing widened and the subway system expanded although the process is slow because of the exorbitant cost of land. More fundamental than the physical changes is the weak ening of the traditional family ties and the erosion of paternal authority, but some parents still try to rule their children in the traditional manner, and the result if often tragedy. Kiyoshi is an 18‐year‐old run away from his home in a pro vincial city. He is an only son but, he says, he couldn't stand having his parents run ning his life. He abandoned home and college, came to To kyo with the equivalent of $90 and a small suitcase and sought out an old high‐school friend, with whom he shares a room 9 feet by 12. Kiyoshi, who works as a waiter in one of Tokyo's in numerable small tearooms, said: “Someday I'll go home. But I've got to find myself first. Until then I'm not going to get in touch with my parents.” The malaise of Kiyoshi and his fellows is manifested by the fact that nearly 10,000 young people, of whom 6,253. were students from 156 univer sitiei, were arrested this year for participating in acts of vi olence during campus disputes and demonstrations against the Government's alleged collusion with the United States on Oki nawa and Vietnam. Over 1,000 are still detained. Of a university population of 1.5 million about 26,000 are considered leftist activists and sympathizers, of whom 14, 000 are affiliated with the Com munists (anti‐Government but also antiviolence) and 12,000 oppose the Communists from Marxist or anarchist viewpoints. Japan as a whole, as a na tion confronting the decade of the seventies, seems to be in a mood similar to Kiyoshi's. The Japanese know they belong in world society. They know that, as their national wealth increases so does the burden of their responsibilities. But they have not yet worked out for themselves what they really want to be or do. If their national goals still remain obscure, they know at least that the preparatory stage of the nineteen‐sixties is over. Their national confidence has revived and they are ready to undertake a more demanding role.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Albany's Year: From Abortion to Redistricting,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/01/05/archives/albanys-year-from-abortion-to-redistricting.html,"When the State Legislature convenes for its 193d session Wednesday, it will face a com plex and difficult series of issues. Governor Rockefeller has Republican majorities to sup port him in both houses, but the Democrats plan to press harder than ever for more lib eral state aid to education, to the cities and to the poor. Mayor Lindsay, too, will battle energetically for similar goals. One of the fascinating political problems of the ses sion — with possible conse quences in the November elec tion—will be the extent to which the Mayor, who has pointedly refused to declare himself for Governor Rockefeller's re‐elec tion, will align himself with the Democrats. Top Priority The first major task at Al bany will be redrawing the dis trict lines of the state's 41 Con gressional districts—a task that must be completed by Jan. 31 under Federal Court mandate. The Republicans have new maps prepared which they confidently expect will add substantially to their Congressional strength in upstate areas. These maps should be made public in time for the voters to form opinions about the fair ness of the new districts and register their views with the legislators. Unfortunately, the general expectation is that the Republicans will steamroller their plan through with a mini mum of debate or public discus sion. They are under definite warning, however, that flagrant gerrymandering will again re sult in a court challenge. The Budget Battle The biggest battle of the session will undoubtedly be over the budget. With a state wide election impending, the Governor and the Republican legislative leaders are firmly pledged against any increase in taxes. They will undoubted ly work hard to hold the state's outlay in the neighborhood of $7 billion, which the normal growth of revenues would probably cover. But the Governor has already committed himself to the 10 per cent cost‐of‐living increase recently granted welfare recip ients. He has also indicated his approval of the $300 million in additional aid to education urged by Assembly Speaker Perry B. Duryea. Actually, this does little more than offset the $245 million in cuts imposed by the Legislature last year at the urging of the Governor. But the pressures for far greater expenditures will be very heavy. Mayor Lindsay and the mayors of the six largest cities upstate have formed an alliance to fight for a program of state revenue sharing with local governments; the phased takeover of all education costs by the state, and a program of welfare reform. There will also be insistent demands for some form of in direct fiscal relief for the hard pressed parochial schools of the state. The Democrats, ardently sup porting more state aid for edu cation, health and social serv ices, will fight for a program of tax reform which they contend would finance the increased ex penditure. The emphasis in their program is on an increase in the state income tax in upper brackets. Since the payments would be fully deductible from the Federal income tax, the argument is advanced that the increase would be relatively painless. Abortion, always a conten tious subject, will come up in a new guise in Albany this year. The forces that formerly fought for reform are likely to make their first effort this year in support of a measure sponsored by Assemblywoman Constance E. Cook. It calls for total repeal of the law against abortion. If this fails, they will turn to the reform measure of Assembly man Albert H. Blumenthal, which was narrowly beaten last year. New York City's school der centralization program will also come before the Legislature. It will have to decide whether to adopt the districting plan pro posed by the Board of Educa tion and put an end to the present demonstration districts —a highly controversial matter. The Legislature may also de cide to postpone the board elec tions and clarify the election procedures. More Problems Among other massive prob lems requiring Albany's atten tion is whether to give final approval to the new Code of Criminal Procedure. Designed to restructure the state's criminal code for the first time in 88 years, it is a subject of argue ment by civil libertarians fear ful that it infringes many rights of defendants. The Legislature will also be called on to revise the mental hygiene law—an other highly technical and in volved undertaking. Governor Rockefeller has asked the legislators to approve a constitutional amendment re ducing the voting age from 21 to 18, but action seems doubt ful in the light of the abundance of other problems awaiting de cision.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excerpts From F.B.I. Transcripts of Tapes Released at the De Carlo Trial,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/01/07/archives/excerpts-from-fbi-transcripts-of-tapes-released-at-the-de-carlo.html,"Following are excerpts of transcripts of electronic recordings made by the Federal Bureau of Investigation from 1961 to 1965. They were made at places frequented by Angelo (Gyp) De Carlo—identified as Ray—who is defendant with three others in a conspiracy‐extortion trial now in progress in Federal Court in Newark. The transcripts were made public late yesterday after noon and the excerpts are based on a preliminary reading. The transcripts consist of 1,200 pages of recorded con versations and F B.I. summaries of such conversations. The italicized portions are F.B.I. reports. Those in Ro man type are direct quotations reported by the F.B.I. Informant reported the fol lowing conversation between Angelo De Carlo and Harold Konigsberg on March 31, 1961: DE CARLO: Listen now. got some people, some mil lionaires, but these people seem to know something about Jamaica. They would invest a million if there would be any gambling and they could have a piece of it... KONIGSBERG: (Much of Konigsberg's statements at this point are inaudible, how ever, he mentions a $750,000 loan at 20 per cent apparent ly in connection with the hotel in Jamaica). DE CARLO: How can he meet the payments at 20 per cent per week? KONIGSBERG: That's 20 per cent for a year, not week. DE CARLO: Oh, 20 per cent for a whole year. KONIGSBERG: Yeah, it's a one‐year loan. I don't want to destroy the joint. DE CARLO: Shylocks get 50 per cent or 100 per cent. Do you have a phone number where I can reach you? KONIGSBERG: Yeah, sure, it's my office. (Konigsberg did not repeat a phone num ber, but apparently gave De Carlo a card or wrote down a number for him)... KONIGSBERG: It's the trucking office. I'm there Monday and Friday. It's in South Kearny. DE CARLO: You're there? KONIGSBERG: Let me ex plain. I'm there when I ain't working. I'm, making up my own shylock operation. I've been working day and night for four week now. I even had pneumonia. DE CARLO: I want you to sit down with these people. One guy went to Europe who was here the other night. He said sure, if I thought there was any possibility of getting gambling, we would put the money up. KONIGSBERG: Do you know who I'll get it from? Frank Sinatra. DE CARLO: I'm going down there next week. I'll see Sinatra and have a talk with him. KONIGSBERG: Is he going to be in Florida next week? DE CARLO: He'll be there until the 12th or 13th. I'm going down there Friday so I'll see him before he leaves. As soon as I get there, I'll call up and leave word where I'm at in case you need to get in touch with me.... What do you do? What kind of work? KONIGSBERG: Shylocking, that's how we make a living. DE CARLO: Use a little common sense. Go and book horses. All that stealing and all.... * * * At one point De Carlo was said to be upset because Frank Sinatra refused to ac cept a telephone call from one of his aides, who “had made it clear he was calling for De Carlo,” said another F.B.I. report. Purpose of the call was not made clear and Mr. Sinatra's name was not used again. Addonizio Citations An F.B.I. znrormant (N.K. 2251‐C) tells of a conversation between De Carlo, Little Joe De Benedictis and Si Rega. JOE: You know, Si, it's go ing to take three weeks but we'll own this Hughie [Ad donizio]. This guy here, I'll guarantee, we'll own him. I'll use that term—in three or four weeks. He wants to get rid of some crums around him. RAY: Well, when you see him today, tell him that if he ever does business with more than one guy he won't last. Conversation on Sept. 7, 1962, between Angelo [Ray] De Carlo and someone be lieved to be Joseph [Little Joe] DeBenedictis, in regard to setting up a company. JOE: So that's the way it stands now. They got Som ers County all tied up. They tied that up last night. Now how the hell are we gonna get to Kenny [John V. Kenny]? RAY: You gotta make an appointment with him. Tell him I sent you. Tell him you and I is in with this it's a company we formed and we're in with it. Hughie (Ad donizio) helped us along. He give us the city. We'd like to get these towns and... JOE: [Later in the same con versation] I'll tell him I ain't even got my name down... Now this guy Bontempo, lis ten to what I say (inaudible). JOE: This is a serious situa tion, Ray. We gave him a raw deal. We got him in hole. An F.B.I. informant (N.K. 92–379) tells of a meeting at which De Carlo discussed the 1962 mayoralty race in Newark: “Concerning the forth coming political campaign for Addonizio, De Carlo again outlines his views on secur ing funds. He said only about five people would be invited to give and the $10‐ bookmakers' would have to make their own connections. De Carlo feels confident that his money will be well spent since gambling arrests wsill be made only by the gam bling squad. “De Carlo related that he had scheduled the meeting with Tony Boy (Anthony Boiardo) and Addonizio the following day for the purpose of having Tony Boy tell Hughie that he can control Oscar Girard's (a Demo cratic ward leader) support of Addonizio.” The following is excerpted from a verbatim transcript reported by the F.B.I. on Aug. 15, 1963, or a conversation between De Carlo and Joe De Benedictus, Democratic leader of Newark's First Ward. JOE: The guy's [Addonizio] taking 400, 500 for little jobs. That's why nobody can get a job off him. This jerk Michelli [phonetic spelling] there—the bag man—Bon tempo called him the bag man—he's right! JOE: You know the chair man of the electrical commis sion in Newark—in New Jersey—like electrical con tractors—is Captain Quinn. RAY: Oh no wonder—they always paid him. JOE: He's head of a private organization of electrical con tractors. He works for them. That's another contact that was made by Joe De Bene dictus for them. Years ago. DE CARLO: Hughie [Ad donizio] closed the game. He said we could have a card game if we want to. Irving Berlin must have beefed to Hughie that we have an O.K. and he wanted one, too. Dick [Spina] told me last night. Dick said that he [Hughie] said the prosecutor knew about the game. Five crap games in Newark and he only picks on this one. I told Dick, “You tell that guy [Addonizio] that I've got a message from Jersey City [John V. Kenny] to give to him and if he makes me wait for a week to give him the message, I'll go back and tell the guy in Jersey City and he [Addonizio] better never look for a favor in Jersey City again. JOE: Hughie is ignoring everybody, Ray. RAY: I'm going to tell him when I see him. Dick is sup posed to call me tonight at 6:30 and let me know when. * * * RAY: Well, I was all out for Hughie — we give the louse 4,000. And I can't even see the louse when I want to see him. * * * RAY: Well, the s.o.b. [Ad donizio] is starting to a little stubborn. The louse, I put him in there! The police is all right—the Director— Spina. Any time I look for a favor from him, he does it. * * * RAY: And if Hughes gives any trouble, I'll tell Johnny Kenny to tell Hughes to go to hell?? He'd tell him! Gambling Report Informant reported that Lou Martone met with An gelo De Carlo on Jan. 16, 1963: Martone reported, “I didn't get the check, but I called in yesterday and its in the mail. I'll bring you in at least $12,000 tomorrow and next week another $12, 000. Don't worry, you've got it all coming.” Pete Landusco met with De Carlo. Jack Pan els reported to De Carlo that Joe Zicarelli had called him to report that he [Zicarelli] had determined that Louis Caporaso was in Brooklyn attempting to get money from relatives. JACK: Jimmy Napp [Na poli] got a hold of me last night and he told me that this Smitty, remember Smit ty from Brooklyn, we went in with him years ago? Him, Joe Columho, and another guy have got a crap game in Brooklyn. They've got a $500 limit and they're stuck $40, 000. Jimmy says they've got a terrific game and Smitty told him they're looking for a partner. Jimmy said the, only way he would take piece of the game is if you would be interested. JACK: Joe [Zicarelli] called up this morning and I called him back. He said: “Tell all your friends that the Treas ury men are in town and they're going to be here to day and tomorrow.” Conversation between per sons believed to he Frank Toddo Marino, later joined by Louis Pereello and Lucky Carl Silesia, Leash and Joe (the Indian) Polverino.

RAY: Yeah. Each town. And for the whole country, he wants to make another different price: LUCKY: TELL him—. SI: Do you want to hear the rest of the story? June, July, August and September, he wants double. RAY: Here's what I figure. Let's move all the offices into Long Branch and we'll just pay him for Long Branch. LUCKY: That's a good idea.

LUCKY: Aldino [phonetic spelling] yeah, he's all right. RAY: He's Poagy's [Alfred Torriello] brother‐in‐law. It should be noted that De Carlo has been anxious to con tact Dominick Capello, who was recently confirmed as Su perintendent of the New Jer sey State Police, to have Ca pello stop the State Troopers from harassing his numbers operations in the shore area. Capello had been reluctant to meet him because of the new ness of his appointment. De Carlo eventually arranged to have Tokyo Joe Casamassa contact Capello. Newark has opened a case on Casumassa to obtain full background and his activities inasmuch as he appears to be the intermedi ary between the subjects and Capello. Concerning a Murder De Carlo, William Rega Sil and Silesia discussed the recent killing at the Essex County Hunting and Fishing Club on March 13, 1963. RAY: He's in a predicament with a had prosecutor like Lynch [phonetic spelling]. don't see how he [possibly Tony Boy Bolardo] even let him give himself up. LEASH: I couldn't stand that. RAY: Tony Boy talked it over with Dick [Newark Po lice Director Dominick A. Spina] and Dick said let him come in—we'll make it self defense. LEASH: Yeah, but if it was only them, but like you said before... RAY: It was good the way the broad put it in—she said this boy began fooling around —he had an argument with her and the guy throwed the bottle — he grabbed a knife from the kitchen and stabbed the guy with it. While he's stabbing him, she's hitting him on the head with a bottle. According to [Dr.] Abano, he was killed from being hit on the head. SI: Well, that's what they'll go by. Whatever she gets convicted of, he'll be an ac cessory. At 10:20 P.M. The inform ant advised that Peter La Bar biera and possibly one other person joined the group. SI: [Referring to La Bar biera's case which was re cently dismissed] Congratula tions! PETE: They cleared every body. Cleared the rat. LEASH: Cleared the rat, too? PETE: Yeah, and they cleared the guy who pled guilty. RAY: I think Kenny [John V.] must have put . . . PETE: Under five thousand Ray. RAY: Huh? PETE: Under that . . . RAY: On, Federal can't come in then. RAY: Who was the judge? PETE: This guy from Cam den. Madden. RAY: Oh, Madden's a good man. He's a hell of a man! He was the guy that gave Rozzen [Phonetic spelling] that year only. Political Information On Aug. 13, 1964, an F.B.I informant in Newark, saic that Angelo De Cario hac told a switchboard operator at the Democratic conven tion in Atlantic City that yeas to write down all numbers called by the late Senato, Robert F. Kennedy and to furnish them to him. The op erator agreed to do it. * * * Excerpt from a verbatim transcript of a conversation reported by the F.B.I. in formant Aug. 26, 1961. The informant reportea that DeCarlo had two guests for supper. One was identi fied as Samuel A. Naples, Commissioned of Registration and Secretary of the County Board of Elections. Sam intro duced George Naples [relation unknown]. RAY: If he [Mitchell (former Secretary of Labor James P. Mitchell then a candidate fot Governor) brings that Eisen hower here it's bad. SAM: It's tough but the guy can win! George will tell you I know him [Hughes] like no body's brother. I know him all my life. I pushed him intc the county chairmanship when he was readw to quit. I pushed him. I told him.you can't quit now, we got this wrapped up. You know what his nick name is “two‐bucket” —carry ing water on both shoulders. The guy is a terrible guy to pinpoint down on something to get a direct answer. He'll be yes to you and yes to me. That's been the biggest prob lem he has. I had a fight with him. Over Sal withdrawing as his campaign manager. Then Peter [Rodino] was to be his camapign manager. I was Washington. I ap peared before Senator Kefau ver's committee on elections —on residence requirements and constitutional revisions, I was invited down. So I went to this meeting with Dick [Hughes], I Pete and Hughie (Addonizio). He stood right alongside of me and agreed to come back to Trenton and tell the State Committee that he wanted Pete to be his campaign manager. RAY: Who do you think will be Attorney General if Hughes would win? SAM: At this particular writing I would say Thorne Lord. RAY: Oh, really? How about Rodino? SAM: Peter would he all right. He don't look for trouble. He won't go out of his way to hurt anybody. RAY: If Hughes gets in there I'd rather see a Hudson County man. I hop John [last name un known] gets it because with him there we'd be all right. * * * SAM: L hope he wins it. But Republicans have always been the best as far as gam bling in this state is con cerned. I don't care what anybody says. GEORGE: Know why? Democrats were always on the reform side. * * * Excerpt from F.B.I. report: Sept. 7, 1962: Source reported that Mickey Bontempo was given $5,000 to drop out of the Newark mayoralty race and promised a job. Bontempo is angry be cause a State Water Commis sion job was given to his brother, Salvatore, and not him on the recommendation of Mayor Addonizio. Following is an F.B.I. sum mary of a meeting between De Carlo and two other men. “De Carlo expressed an noyance at Tony Boy (An thony Boiardo) for having contacted Hugh Addonizio direct and offering him $5,000. Ray interpreted this as an ex pression of distrust and feels that Tony Boy was trying to pave the way for continuous personal contact with Addo nizio. Ray would not blame Addonizio for taking the money Ft was not clear whether he did or not] but feels that Hughie should tell Tony Boy that all money should come through De Carlo.” * * * Here is a summary of in formation furnished on April 20. 1962: The report said that from De Carlo's remarks “it was apparent that he an an un identified man were anxious to get something going in the county (probably Hudson) and when it gets going good they can sell it to the others.'” Elsewhere in the report it says that John V. Kenny, Democratic leader of Hudson County, is also known as “The Little Guy.” In a report dated Aug. 8, 1962, De Carlo called Mr. Kenny. Says the report: “From De Carlo's portion informant determined that Kenny requested De Carlo to contact Newark Mayor Hugh Addonizio in an effort to have Kenny's man appointed of the conversation, the in as hospital administrator of Martland Medical Center. [It appears that Kenny's man is Thomas Finn], who was fired from a similar postion re cently by Jersey City Mayor Gangemi.” The report continues: “De Carlo stated: What will I do with my man, make him call you or make him Call Tom (Gangemi).—I don't know if I can located Hughie tonight, but if you see hint down there, you tell him you was talking to me tonight and I go along with this million per cent. He knows I go along with anything you want. You can talk to him the way you talk to me.'” An F.B.I. report dated Jan. 15, 1963, suggests that an as sociate of Mr. Kenny called De Carlo to tell hint that he had some information re garding a job for Neil Duffy, former Essex County Sheriff. The associate, Jim Corrado, was asked “if he could con tact Cappy [Domenick Capel lo, Superintendent of New Jersey State Police] and ask him to stop bothering the operation in Long Branch and Asbury Park until they could get together with him.” De Carlo alsom entioned to Corrado that a new Long Branch city manager was to be named on Feb. 15 [1963]. “He [De Carlo] said Cor rado should ask his boss for the name of someone who is a million per cent to whom they can give the job. He rioted the city manager has charge of the Police Depart ment.” On Nov. 20, 1963, De Carlo “contacted the Pollack Hos pital in Jersey City, where he spoke with an individual, believed to be John V. Kenny,” an F.B.I. memo said. De Carlo's call was “to re mind Kenny that he had rec ommended Steve Capiello, Hoboken Councilman and a sergeant at the Hoboken Police Department, to Jimmy Corrado [Mr. Kenny's aide de camp].” Mr. Kenny was said to have acknowledged having re ceived the information and indicated he would make an appointment with Capiello. At the same time, De Carlo indicated that Dennis Carey, then the Essex County Democratic chairman, had met with Little Joe (Joseph De Benedicts) and offered to put him on the payroll of Essex County. * * * On Nov. 11, 1963, said. another F.B.I. memo, De Carlo called Corrado, who was then assistant administrator of Pollach Hospital in Jersey. City. The two men discussed “the recent success of C. Robert Sarcone in being elected Essex County Sena, tor.” Some Relationships The F.B.I. conversation transcript from which the following excerpts were taken reflects, according to its cover sheet, Angelo De Carlo's relationship with law enforcement officials in New Jersey. The conversation was between De Carlo and his lieutenant, William [Si) Raga, and toolz place on Oct. 31, 1964: DE CARLO: Jimmy [James Corrado, secretary to Hudson County Democratic leader John V. Kenny] was talking to the Commissioner—Com missioner Lynch [United States Commissioner H. Les ter Lynch of Jersey City], them warrants they used to raid them Jersey City num bers last week was taken out in 1963. DE CARLO: We got the prosecutor, we got‐John [V. Kenny]! What the, hell do we have to pay . . . for? DE CARLO: He [Domenick Capello, Superintendent of New Jersey State Police] does: cut his money up with Halley [Maj. Frank Halley, New Jet sey State Police] and that other trooper — what's his name, Dollar [Capt. Jerry, Dollar]. DE CARLO: I wish this. Bill Kennedy [Capt. William Kennedy, New Jersey State Police] was the major. We'd get anything we want. He's. a right guy. The F.B.I. ques tioned him about Pussy [An thony Russo]. They said, “Do you go to his house?” “Yeah I go to his house. I've known him for years. What's wrong with going to his house?” “Well, you know he's supposed to be in the Cosa Nostra?” “Cosa Nostra thy foot! He's a perfect gentle man!” Conversations on Judges An early evening meeting on Saturday, March 14, 1964, between Angelo De Carlo, Jo seph De Benedictis, Samuel Bozza and William Rega, in which they discuss an indict ment of an acquaintance, Peter Pontani, for abortion. SAM: So Sam Vennieri from the prosecutor's office told the judge, “Look, this is Sam Bozza's case. He's down in Florida now.” So Judge Crane said, “Who's your coun sel?” He said, “Samuel Boz za.” So he turned to Justice Waldor and said, “Why do you want $5,000 bail in this case? This man appeared. You just sent him a notice to appear and he's here. He's married, he's got children, he lives in Newark, he's working as a hairdresser. Why should there be $5,000 hail? $1,000 is enough.” So then Judge Crane told me about it. “They wanted $5,000 bail but when I heard you was his lawyer kept it down.” * * * JOE: They had a good chance to make Duffy this time. They were gonna put him up — then that Sarcone put that Cammerata up for judge. Why the hell didn't he put him up for Duffy's job and put Duffy upstairs? RAY: What's that? JOE: County judge! RAY: What happened? JOE: He put a guy by the name of Cammerata —his name in. RAY: Who did? JOE: Sarcone. RAY: When? JOE: Well he's gonna be confirmed.... SAM: He's gonna be the judge — and take Matthew's RAY: Why do you tell me these things the last minute? JOE: Ray, I don't know if you know. The guy never called me. Maybe I figured the guy doesn't want me to know what's going on. I mind my business. RAY: Well let me know when you hear a thing like that. Is too late now? JOE: Sure. He stuck his name in and everything. Christ—he knows you were Duffy's friend. [Neil G. Duffy, former Essex County Sheriff.] RAY: That louse! JOE: Sure—I thoug??t you knew. * * * RAY: Like with Byrne. He [Sarcone] said, “Gee if he [the Governor] asks me to reap point Byrne, how can I re fuse?” I said, “You tell him to tell Hughes to go to hell! That's all! You don't want him and that's all! He's ob noxious —you don't have to give no other reason.” [Rob ert Sarcone is an Essex Coun ty Senator]. * * * SAM: And if he's smart, and Cammerata doesn't want to take the domestic relations court judge, another thing can he done that will even help the Democratic party. He can move Duffy into the County Court and he can take one of the Freeholders— the Republican — and push him into the Juvenile Court judgeship. That Stanziole girl. Then he'll have two jobs. He'll have Duffy and the Juve nile Court judgeship. The Democrats would go along with that. This Whole thing has got to be sold to Hughes. (Ray explained that lie has not given Sarcone his atten tion because of the recent Grand Jury.) RAY: I didn't want to he seen anywhere. Because they did—one G‐man made a re mark. He said, “He's a maker of politicians.” JOE: There's somebody who knows your business Ray! * * * JOE: Look who that Spina Dominick Spina, Newart P lice Director] was having. lunch with the other day. Re member that guy from the labor group? Biancardi? Jim my Caputo and a couple of Irish broads. They're having dinner together. Ray, they talk? * * * (Ray related having Met. for an hour with Spina fol lowing the death of Spina'S father. He said Spina was very much annoyed at the constant orders he gets froth the Mayor and often wishes, he were out of the job.) RAY: He said, “And then I', gotta take orders from yoii and Jerry Catena —but you and Jerry never asked me to make a move. I gotta admit it. You never came to me for a favor. But Bananas and Tony Boy! I feel like telling them to go to hell!” JOE: I make you a predie tion, Ray. If there's ever an investigation this guy??ll go to the can. Don't bother with him, Ray. Little Joe claimed Mickey Botempo is d vicious politi cian and could well be re sponsible for a serious scan dal in Newark. He feels Hugh. Addonizio will end up in jail for association with Botem po. RAY: Jimmy [Del Mauro,. Newark attorney] told me only last week that Hughie still thinks he's gonna rub for Governor. SAM: He's crazy! RAY: I said, “Jimmy, you better get a judgeship off hint before you get nothing and he gets indicted. That guy promised Jimmy a judgeship the first of the year—here it is March and he didn't give it to him yet. * * * Re: Addonizio: RAY: He's got the Police Department mad at him and everything. JOE: That Dughi [Detec tive, Newark police depart ment] is doing a job on him! He'll knock his brains out. Cause they like that guy. He never hurt anybody. And he don't put his hand out. RAY: No, you can't give him . . . JOE: And if he does you favor, he does you a favor! RAY: Well that's the way it should be done. Instead of this lousy Carey getting five and ten thousand to make a judge, he should do it for nothing. The group again discussed Mayor Addonizio with Jog complaining that he couldn't. get a city job for his Ray vowed he'd never give another penny to Hughie. He'd have to look for help. from Berlin, Bananas and Bioardo. Joe claimed Hughie was gambling heavily at the track. He said he made $20,000 at a recent testimonial dinner.

Facade of Amity in the Legislature,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/01/08/archives/facade-of-amity-in-the-legislature-politicians-say-that-partisan.html,"ALBANY, Jan. 7—Democrats and Republicans indulged in their annual ritual of ceremo nial amity today at the opening of the legislative session, vow ing to work together for the good of the people of New York State.  News Analysis To observers here, an inevi table question arose: At what point, after the glow of flowery rhetoric has worn off, and, on what issue, will the fa cade of amiability dissolve? There were no clear answers today, but politicians interviewed agreed that the veil of good intentions had hidden many head‐on collisions, partic ularly in this election year when political realities are inexorably mixed with campaign hyper bole. When the Republican major ity leaders and Governor Rock efeller speak of such things as a $300‐million “increase” in school aid, the Democratic mi nority leaders call it a “restor ation,” and an “inadequate re storation” at that. ‘I Told You So’ The Democrats will submit their own legislative program— one Democrat said it would con sist of several hundred bills— but most of it has virtually no chance of passage since their party controls neither house. The Democrats are expected by some to be more effective as election‐year watchdogs and ac tivists who will be quick to say “I told you so” when the por tions of the Republican pro gram, particularly in education and welfare, are debated. The “I‐told‐you‐so” character ization made by a Republican leader was a reference to the 1969 session when the Demo crats bitterly and in unison fought the cuts In anticipated spending enacted with the Governor's approval in health, education and welfare pro grams. Referring to Mr. Rockefeller's program outlined to a joint ses sion of the Legislature today, the Republican added: “But I don't think people care much about that, so long as the school people and the welfare people are reasonably happy.” For the time being, at least, Democrats and Republicans are predicting that the session will have a mellower tone than the last one, when the Democrats felt, as one put it, “We had been summarily dismissed.” Some people feel that even if the Governor's key proposals, such as the one for added edu cation funds, do not satisfy the Democrats, they will ultimately have to go along with them in this election year rather than take no action and be accused of being obstructionists. “The question is: Can the Governor euchre the Democrats into going along with his pro gram?” one Assemblyman said. The question is pretty much academic so far as the Senate is concerned. There Senate Ma jority Leader Earl W. Brydges is firmly in control of the Re publicans who dominate that house, 33 to 24. It is not so in the Assembly, where Republicans predominate 79 to 68 (there are three Demo cratic vacancies that the Gov ernor has yet to decide whether to fill by calling a special elec tion, and Assembly Speaker Perry B. Duryea, according to the rules of that chamber, needs 76 votes to pass a bill. He can suffer, therefore, no more than three defections in party line votes. Nine of the Republicans he must treat with owe their mar gin of victory to the fact that they also were the nominees of the Conservative party. Last year, Mr. Duryea's first as Speaker, he managed (some times in a fashion that one ob server dubbed “The Perils of Perry”) to make enough con cessions to the conservative Re publicans to get passage of Mr. Rockefeller's program. This year, it is generally con ceded that he has a tighter grip on the reins but there are those who fear that the conservatives will balk at portions of the Governor's message and Mr. Duryea will be forced to seek Democratic support. Nonpartisan Issues Not all of the expected fric tion will be along party lines. Issues such as the Governor's proposal to repeal the state's strict constitutional ban on aid to parochial schools, sometimes called the Blaine Amendment, and to replace it with the less restrictive language of the Fed eral Constitution, already prom ises to transcend party affilia tions with pros and cons on both sides. Another area where party af filiation will be secondary lies in attempts to repeal or revise the state's 87‐year‐old abortion law, which permits termination of a pregnancy only when the mother's health is in jeopardy. But one Republican leader, summing up the commitment of the majority leadership to seek no tax increases and musing on the Democrat's charge that the Governor deliberately built in a “$600‐million election‐year cush ion” in the 1969 budget in which to finance his new program, said: “It will be quite a partisan session.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Excerpts From Governor Rockefeller's Address at Opening of the Legislature,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/01/08/archives/excerpts-from-governor-rockefellers-address-at-opening-of-the.html,"We are here today to examine chal lenges, weigh priorities and set goals for the nineteen seventies.  ALBANY, Jan. 7—Following are ex cerpts from Governor Rockefeller's 12th annual message to the Legislature—the State of the State message: We are here to make judgments to gether on the actions that will most effectively realize the opportunities be fore us in the decade ahead. We undertake this task in the knowl edge that never before in history has any nation made such rapid improve ment in the quality of life for its people. The decade of the nineteen‐sixties brought unprecedented progress in terms of industrial expansion, high em ployment, rapidly rising personal in come and vastly enlarged opportunities for self‐retization. But the result for most people of in creased opportunity and rapidly rising standards of living has of necessity been an accelerating rate of change—change that increasingly affects the mores and the very fabric of our society. These changes in our economic and social patterns have resulted from an ever‐accelerating rate of scientific dis covery and revolutionary advance in technology. Effects of Changing Patterns And these changes have produced two significant effects: ¶First, uncertainty, insecurity and fear. ¶Secondly, a weakening of traditional moral values, guidelines and restraints. And so we have witnessed the in crease in juvenile delinquency, in ex cessive use of drugs, in crime and in violence. This, in turn, has caused increased fear, bitterness and polarization in our society. On the other hand, there are also very positive forces developing: Forces that give us hope we may be entering a significant period of self renewal as a society. More and more people—and espe cially young people — are questioning hypocrisy and injustice in our society. They also question the mad scramble for material progress that, unless checked, may well be on the way to despoiling our environment. Thus, the danger that apathy, selfish ness and indifference could engulf and destroy our affluent society is being challenged by a rebirth of idealism and concern. Our challenge is to create a frame work to shape forces of change so they serve our goals instead of overwhelm ing us. We can overcome poverty and injus tice. Those of us elected to public office have a special responsibility to listen to the people and to lead. Record of State Is Cited During the past decade, together, we have forged a record here in New York —you as legislators and I as Governor— that has placed the Empire State in the forefront in meeting the needs of the people. No state in the United States matches New York today in the support of pub lic schools. No state in the United States is ex panding opportunity in higher education to a degree that even begins to ap proach our pace in New York. No state in the United States—except New York—has recognized a major state role in improving mass transporta tion. This record of new and bold ap proaches to problems new and old is also clear in our initiatives: ¶To fight crime and narcotics ad diction. ¶To further urban development and housing. ¶To protect the health of the indi vidual. ¶To promote the arts. ¶To expand state parks. ¶To provide all those services the citizen expects and deserves from re sponsible government. Growth in the Economy All this has been made possible in large measure because of an unprece dented growth of the state's economy. Personal income, disposable income, factory earnings and the index of busi ness activity are all at all‐time highs. This economic expansion has been and remains a cornerstone of the policy of this administration. Now as we enter the next decade, it time to take stock together. It is no simple matter to maintain the momentum of progress. State and local governments are passing through an ex tremely trying period. There is no state today that is serious ly attempting to meet the needs of its people that is not at the same time suf fering severe financial problems. The same is especially true for the cities, but it is also true for other local governments. The problem has been greatly exacer bated by the forces of inflation. Not only have the demands risen but the cost to state and local government of providing needed services has soared. Difference in Taxes Cited No matter how courageous, deter mined or innovative state and local gov ernments may be in seeking to meet the needs of their people, the simple fact that the capacity of these governments to raise needed revenues on a sound basis is limited. Therefore, the executive budget will reflect my determination to hold the line against pressure for excessive state spending—and against any increase in state taxes. Three things are becoming increasing ly evident: First, that this nation must meet its responsibilities on the home front. We can no longer tolerate poverty, hunger, injustice, deterioration of our cities, inadequate housing, faltering mass transportation, poor education and poor health—now that we have the capacity and resources as a nation to meet these needs. Second, that only the Federal Govern ment has the magnitude of resources necessary to do the job. Thirdly, it has become increasingly clear that while the more concerned states, which try desperately to meet the needs of their people, have enacted major increases in their state taxes, other states have not. We already have a situation where these discrepancies in state tax levels are adversely affecting the movement of job ‐ producing business and industry away from socially conscious states like New York. In fact, New York State and local taxes combined now represent the high est tax effort of any competitor state. In view of this situation, I would hope that all state and local public officials would join me in a concerted effort to impress upon the Federal Gov ernment the urgency for greatly in creased Federal assistance and to sup port steps that would bring this about. For unless the Congress reverses its year‐end tax cuts, which are not only in flationary but also reduced the basis for Federal revenue growth so necessary to provide the funds to meet our acutely urgent human needs at home, the Presi dent may well be forced by events to turn to a wage‐price‐dividend freeze. In the meantime, however, we cannot use the present lack of adequate Federal assistance as an excuse for irresponsi bility or inaction. We can and we must work together to achieve the goals I have outlined for the decade of the 70's—and I am con fident that the Federal Government must soon recognize its major home front re sponsibilities. Let us turn now to my specific recom mendations for the consideration of your honorable bodies at this session. To Eliminate Poverty and In justice and to Make the Opportunity for Good Edu cation and Good Health a Universal Right In this first section, I will deal with the basic and essential elements hich contribute to each individual's ability to achieve quality in his or her own life— full opportunity for a good education and training, good health care, a good job, decent wages, protection against ex ploitation or discrimination in any form and, where needed, the necessary social services for the family, the aged, the blind and the disabled, as well as the care of the young and good nutrition for all. EDUCATION Primary and Secondary Education I propose an increase in the ceiling on state aid to schools from $760 to $900 a pupil. I will recommend additional assistance for those school districts that would not benefit sufficiently from the proposed increase in the ceiling, and a first step toward 50‐50 state sharing of school costs. Repealing Blaine Amendment [A] special commission will have as a major part of its concern the long term relationship between public and private schools, with special emphasis on the fiscal problems of the private schools, with the objective of develop ing appropriate ways in which the state can help further to insure the quality of education for children attending pri vate schools. In order that your honorable bodies may be in a position to respond positive ly to these recommendations in the fu ture, I recommend that, at this session, there be a first passage of a Constitu tional amendment to repeal the Blaine Amendment to the State Constitution and to substitute the less restrictive language of the Federal Constitution on separation of church and state. Full Opportunity Program I recommend a “Full Opportunity” program offering access to a meaning ful further education for every young man and woman graduating from high school in New York State. The elements of the proposed full op portunity program include: ¶An increase in state operating aid for community colleges from 33 1/3 per cent to 40 per cent for those community colleges submitting acceptable plans for admission of all high school gradu ates in their area who apply. ¶Creation of an occupational training assistance corporation to guarantee loans enabling individuals to purchase spe cific skill‐training from both public and private resources. ¶Expansion of SEEK and other re medial and preparatory programs at State University, City University of New York and the private colleges. ¶Expansion of State University urban centers to provide occupational educa tion for additional urban citizens. ¶lnitiation by State University col leges of an innovative off‐campus study program to permit a further increase in enrollment of 1,300 additional students this fall. ¶An increase of commuter enroll ments in State University senior col leges to provide for a further increase of 1,600 additional students this fall. ¶Funds to pay the state's share of full implementation this fall of the open‐ admissions program of the City Univer sity of New York. ¶Establishment of a network of high er education intake centers, jointly spon sored by State University and private colleges in urban areas and designed to provide sound remedial and preparatory education as a basis for transfer to one of the sponsoring colleges. HEALTH The availability of good health care is inseparably linked to the quality of life; indeed, I believe that access to good health care must be regarded as a funda mental human right. The present system of Medicaid and Medicare will never, in my opinion, be able to meet the health care needs and costs of all New Yorkers. Additional measures are necessary to achieve a fuller opportunity for good health care in the state. I will therefore again submit recom mendations to achieve this goal, includ ing: Universal Health Insurance I have consistently advocated a sys tem of contributory universal health in surance as the first line of defense against illness and accident. Universal health insurance would cover a major portion of the hospital and medical needs of the vast majority of the state's working men and women and their families. Blue Cross and Blue Shield Even under universal health insur ance, voluntary nonprofit health insur ance plans, such as Blue Cross and Blue Shield, would continue to provide the principal source of health protection for millions of New Yorkers. I will therefore recommend legislation that would require: ¶Additional public participation on Blue Cross and Blue Shield boards; and ¶Public hearings before rate increases or benefit reductions are approved. German Measles New vaccines offer us an opportuni ty to wipe out German measles, disease that may cause birth defects in the children of mothers infected in the early months of pregnancy. I therefore, will submit legislation establishing a program to immunize all New York State schoolchildren against this disease, since school‐age children are the principal carriers. Abortion Law Reform I continue to believe very strongly that the state's archaic abortion law must be changed. Recently, the state's law and similar statutes in other jurisdictions have come under attack in state and Federal courts across the nation. I urge your honorable bodies to resolve the differ ences of the past and to give favorable action to much‐needed legislation on abortion reforms. MENTAL HEALTH This administration has introduced pioneering new concepts of care and treatment for the mentally ill, emphasiz ing decentralization of care facilities, community mental health services, in tensive treatment by special teams and child treatment centers. To provide the best possible care in our state hospitals, I will recommend a major increase in institutional staff, special program staffs for adolescents and geriatrics and new funds for half way houses, hostels and family care. I will also recommend a significant increase in the treatment staff for chil dren in all state hospitals. SOCIAL SERVICES In fulfilling its obligation to assist our less‐fortunate citizens, the state serves as a guardian of human dignity. To the degree that failure of our society to meet its social responsibili ties may diminish the dignity and in crease the vulnerability of the deprived, it likewise diminishes the dignity of the whole society. At the same time, it is essential that every possible step he taken to assure efficient administration and to avoid abuses of welfare programs—in fair ness to taxpayers and recipients alike. The State Board of Social Welfare has recommended a 10 per cent cost of‐living increase in public assistance to assure that assistance payments con tinue to provide an adequate basis of support for individuals and families in need. The board has also recommended the establishment of statewide standards of public assistance. I support these recommendations and will submit budgetary and legislative proposals to carry them out. HELPING ELDERLY CITIZENS A few years ago, I was pleased to sign into law a bill enabling real prop erty tax relief for certain older home owners with annual incomes of less than $3,000. I will recommend legisla tion increasing the income qualification to a more realistic level so the program will afford genuine relief to this de serving group of citizens. HUMAN RIGHTS In legislation to prohibit discrimina tion, New York State has led the nation for a quarter of a century—and partic ularly as a result of the many enact ments of the past decade. The Debevoise Committee made some significant additional recommendations in its 1968 report. I am again offering these proposals to: ¶Extend the application of the Hu man Rights Law to all employers, regardless of size, and to all types of employment in the State; ¶Require that qualifications for hir ing, training or promoting employees have a direct relation to performing the job and ¶Extend coverage of the Human Rights Law to all houses and apart ments and all commercial boarding boarding houses. HUNGER For many years, the state has main tained an adequate school lunch pro gram. Now it is essential that we initiate the first major state breakfast program in the nation. I will, therefore, submit to your honorable bodies, for urgent considera tion, a major $2.5‐million state break fast program. This program will assure that about 35,000 inner‐city school children will receive a balanced, nutri tious meal to start each school day. CONSUMER PROTECTION Though we have achieved a high level of consumer protection in this state, I believe we can be even more effective by having the numerous consumer pro grams of our state agencies more closely coordinated. I will, therefore, establish a state con sumer protection board in the Executive Department, comprised of the heads of all state agencies having a primary role in protecting the consumer or providing consumer educational services. An ad visory group will insure broad consumer representation. The measures I will offer will allow the Public Commission to focus solely on electric power and utility service and will expand and strengthen the capacity of the commission. My recommendations will include: ¶Requiring bipartisan membership of the Commission. ¶Transferring the commission's re sponsibilities in the field of transporta tion to the Department of Transporta tion, to complete the consolidation of the state's transportation responsibilities in a single Department of Transporta tion. To Make All Our Communities Safe, Healthy and Attrac tive Places in which to Live, Work and Bring Up Our Children Next to the forces which are essential to developing the whole man, the forces contributing to the development of the whole community must be dealt with in this age of urban living. Without a proper community envi ronment, our other efforts will be for naught. Therefore, in this section, I will deai with crime control in all its forms, con trol of narcotics and dangerous drugs, the physical aspects of community de velopment, including housing, and all forms of transportation, as well as rec reational and cultural opportunities. CRIME CONTROL We cannot tolerate the growing wave of crime which threatens the nation and destroys the quality of life for our citizens. I know this concern is shared by our honorable bodies, by all decent citizens. For the quality of life can have little meaning without freedom from fear. I recommend establishment of a state wide criminal task force within the of fice of the Attorney General to make more effective the prosecution of organ ized crime on a, statewide basis. The task force will be beaded by a special state prosecutor of organized crime, who will derive his authority and receive his appointment jointly from the Governor and the Attorney General. The special state prosecutor will have authority and responsibility to investi gate and prosecute organized crime any where in the state. An alarming number of the serious crimes are committed by persons with prior criminal records. Efforts to reduce the rate of crime cannot be truly suc cessful unless the entire criminal justice system, from arrest through the courts and correctional services, can be made into a more effective instrument for re ducing the number of criminal repeaters. I recommend legislation to establish a new department of correctional services. Its purpose will be to provide greater coordination and continuity in institu tional and field supervisory services for these convicted criminals who re quire imprisonment. This department, incorporating con cepts expressed in the pioneering report of the Governor's Special Committee on Criminal Offenders, will assume re sponsibilities of the present State De partment of Correction and the Division of Parole. NEW CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE The Temporary Commission on Revi sion of the Penal Law and Criminal Code has recommended a new criminal procedure law embodying significant improvements in our system of criminal justice. I urge your careful consideration of these recommendations at this session. NARCOTICS AND DANGEROUS DRUGS One of the most pernicious and de structive forces undermining the quality of life, particularly for our young peo ple, is the alarming increase in the use of drugs. We still have not solved the problem of addiction. There is no proven cure. Thousands of addicts still lack treat ment and supervision. We must continue to teach out, to experiment with new methods of treat ment and rehabilitation. Methadone mai?? is ?? of the programs funded and supervised by the state. While it is not a cure for addiction, it has aided almost 80 per cent of the 2,000 hard‐core addicts who have quali fied for the program to return to soci ally accepted ways of life. I, therefore, will recommend that a total of $15‐million be made available to provide treatment for up to 20,000 addicts in methadone programs by the end of the fiscal year. The widespread use of dangerous drugs, especially among our youth, is a matter of the greatest concern. Present state laws dealing with the use, possession and sale of such drugs as amphetamines, barbiturates, LSD and marijuana are badly in need of com plete re‐evaluation. Accordingly, I propose creation of a temporary state commission to evaluate the, drug laws, to make recommenda tions for improving the effectiveness of present state laws dealing with drugs. COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT The quality of life in the next decade will be heavily influenced by the in telligence with which we plan for the massive growth that will take place in New York State. Obviously, comprehensive community development calls for public action on the state level to assist the private sector and our communities. Accordingly, I will: 1. Propose a Constitutional amendment to replace the antiquated Housing Article in our Constitution with a new community development article, and. 2. Appoint a citizens' commission to make recommendations as to how we deal with the problems. I will further propose a Constitu tional amendment to authorize housing rehabilitation loans to individual home and apartment owners. TRANSPORTATION We have let the nation in creating a total transportation concept for the state, geared to utilizing all modes of travel on a coordinated regional basis. A new State Department of Trans portation has been created and regional action agencies were established to im plement the total transportation plan. The people resoundingly approved a $2.5‐billion bond issue to provide funds to develop the components of a total transportation system — highway rail and air. Progress has been substantial. We will continue our unexcelled high way construction program. We are working on the problem of locating the fourth jetport for the New York metropolitan area through ap propriate state and Federal agencies. I will ask the Governors of New Jer sey and Connecticut to join me in ap pointing a commission to study the pointing a commission to study the possibility of a regional approach to the subsidy of mass transportation fares to keep the, cost within the reach of all people. To help reduce traffic congestion and to ease the burden of people getting to and from work, shopping and other activities, I will recommend legislation to authorize the use of state transporta tion funds to develop public parking facilities on the edges of urban centers in conjunction with convenient bus service. HIGHWAY SAFETY Nearly every two hours, a New Yorker is killed in an automobile ac cident—and many of these accidents involve drinking. A recent study shows that approxi mately 4 per cent of the drivers in volved in fatal accidents in New York had a blood alcohol content in excess of the extremely high level of 0.15 per cent. I will, therefore, resubmit for your consideration legislation that would make it unlawful per se for anyone to operate a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content in excess of 0.15 per cent. PARKS AND RECREATION To further strengthen state govern ment's capacity to meet growing needs for healthful leisure‐time activities, shall recommend the establishment of new department of parks and recreation. This new department will assume the functions of the Division of Parks of the present Conservation Department. The present regional park commissions will retain their status and responsibilities. CULTURE Ten years ago, when I originally pro posed the establishment of a New York State Council on the Arts to your honor able bodies, few could forecast the sub sequent significance of this Legislature's creation—the nation's first government agency for support of the arts. To consider a society without the arts, to think of New York without its celebrated orchestras, museums, libra ries and other cultural entities, is to imagine a cultural wasteland without pride or inspiration for our citizens. Therefore, I urge your honorable bod ies to match your foresight and wis dom of 10 years ago in this field by appropriating $18‐million for a direct aid program to the nonprofit cultural in stitutions in our state. To Restore and Protect the Quality of Our Environment The world is just waking up to the fact that man is rapidly destroying his own environment. Providing the frame work and forces to achieve the whole man and the whole community without restoring and protecting our God‐given environment would be meaningless. Accordingly, I recommend the crea tion of a new department of environ mental conservation. This new department will combine the present responsibilities of the Health Department for air, water and solid waste pollution control with the respon sibilities of the Conservation Depart ment for forest management, oil and gas conservation, fish and wildlife manage ment and water resources development. To Improve the Climate for the Growth of Free Enter prise and Personal Eco nomic Security For those men and w?? who are daily wage earners, the state has a basic responsibility to assure that they are paid a living wage. Accordingly, I will prypose legislation which would: ¶Increase the state's hourly minimum wage from $1.60 to $1.85, effective July 1, 1970, and ¶Increase the maximum benefits for workmen's compensation, disability in surance and unemployment insurance by $10 a week over present levels. I will recommend a major increase in the state appropriation for manpower training, from $15‐million to $25‐million. To Assure Continued Govern ment Leadership in Respon siveness to the People and Their Needs Government is the forum in a demo cratic society in which people еxpress their hopes and aspirations as well as their concerns. Government is also the framework within which they assure their goals. Therefore, government must at all times be kept responsive, and preserve its capacity to adapt and to lead and to take the actions necessary to shape and to solve emerging problems. Our Founding Fathers wisely provided a mechanism for orderly change. They did not devise a system of goverment incapable of adjusting to new develop ments. Instead, they gave us a Constitutional system which in its general flexibility and in its procedures permits even the most dramatic changes to be attained in an orderly manner. I urge your honorable bodies to re quest the Joint Legislative Committee on Elections to undertake a thorough modernization of the State's Election Law. New York City Board of Elections Re organization The present organization of the New York City Board of Elections is badly in need of overhaul. Last year's primary elections demon strated beyond any doubt the need for greater protection of the rights of voters and a revitalization of the board. Eighteen‐Year‐Old Voting The vast majority of young people to day are ready and willing to assume the responsibilities as well as the rights of full citizenship by age 18. Over 10 million young Americans be tween the ages of 18 and 21 support themselves or families of their own. They pay taxes. They serve in the armed forces. I, therefore, will again propose a Con stitutional amendment to lower the voting age in New York State to 18 years. First passage of this amendment would enable this issue to reach the people for a decision by November of 1971. The United States Supreme Court in two recent decisions has virtually elim inated property qualifications as an ac ceptable test for voter eligibility. With the cooperation of Attorney Gen eral Louis J. Lefkowitz and State Con troller Arthur Levitt, I will recommend legislation to complete the elimination of all the remaining property require ments for voter eligibility in the state. Demands from local government for increased state aid of all types continue unabated, despite unprecedented in creases in state aid for every category during the past decade. The Special Committee to Study Per Capita Aid reported to me last month. Its recommendations form the basis for legislation which I will submit for your consideration this year. The legislation will include: ¶A measure extending for an extra year the state's special aid program to cities. This will provide an additional $150‐ million in state aid during 1971–72 above the regular per capita aid program. ¶A “save harmless” provision that will protect municipalities from losing an estimated $16‐million in regular per capita aid during 1971–72 because of population shifts revealed by the 1970 census. As the problems of government grow in size and complexity, the state must continue its efforts to improve the effi ciency and administration of state op erations. Accordingly, I recommend the estab lishment of an institute for governmental executives within the State University Graduate School of Public Affairs, to provide advanced management training for top administrators. Temporary Commission to Modernize the Courts Last year, the League of Women Voters sponsored an excellent proposal calling for the establishment of a tem porary commission to study the court system. I am convinced of the need of this study, particularly in view of the prob lems encountered by the courts in ad ministering criminal justice, in dealing with family matters, and in processing cases in a timely manner. Accordingly, I will submit legislation establishing a temporary commission made up of leading citizens to conduct a thorough review of our judicial system. Improvement of Assessment Practices The rising cost of local government has placed a substantial tax burden on real property. These burdens are often aggrevated by a tax assessment system which is badly out‐of‐date. Accordingly, I shall present specific proposals to your honorable bodies to provide for the first time statewide mini mum standards for assessment practices and procedures, to assure fair and equitable treatment for all real property taxpayers. Conclusion This is a time for faith, for vision and for courage—both for our own state and for the nation. It is a moment when our nation is being watched by the world—watched to see whether we will master events or whether we are going to allow events to overwhelm us. The test is whether flee own can do termine their own destiny. Let us demonstrate our faith in free dom in justice in human dignity. Let us show that as free men, under G?? there ?? human ob ??",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ROCKEFELLER OFFERS PLAN TO REVAMP STATE AGENCIES TO MEET PROBLEMS OF 70'S,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/01/08/archives/rockefeller-offers-plan-to-revamp-state-agencies-to-meet-problems.html,"ALBANY, Jan. 7—Governor Rockefeller established his goals for the new decade today. in, an election‐year message to the Legislature that called for a major reorganization of state government to meet problems of pollution, crime and increas ing population.  The Governor's 12th annual State of the State Message, de livered at the opening of tie 1970 Legislature, asked for the power to shift programs and responsibilities in state govern ment and create a new Depart ment of Environmental Con servation, establish a prosecu tor to investigate crime on a statewide level, and increase state aid to primary and sec ondary education. The Governor also, for the first time, asked the 193d Legis lature to repeal the so‐called Blaine Amendment to the Con stitution to pave the way for future direct state aid to paro chial schools. The proposal was assailed by a Jewish organiza tion and a teachers' association. Favors U. S. Amendment In place of the Blaine Amend ment, Governor Rockefeller asked that the state use “the less restrictive language of the Federal Constitution on separa tion of church and state.” Few of the proposed pro grams had dollar figures at tached, but throughout the mes sage ran the theme of tight money. Funds may be shifted around, the theme insisted, but new funds can come only with increased Federal aid. The Governor said he was determined to “hold the line against pressure for excessive state spending — and against any increase in state taxes.” The total cost of the pro. posals, expected to be at Or slightly over 57‐billion, will be detailed in the budget message to be presented before Jan. 30. The current budget is $6.4. billion. Previously announced re quests for increases of 5300. million for state aid to educe. tion and $136‐million for wel fare benefits were the only, major new spending projects contained in the program, which Governor Rockefeller hopes will serve as a platform for his November re‐election campaign. Immediate and strong crit icism to the Governor's mes sage was directed at his call for a repeal of the Blaine Amendment. The American Jewish Congress and the New York State Teachers Associa tion both called the move a threat to public education in the state. In separate statements, the two organizations warned that the use of state money to “promote the religious beliefs of others” threatened the sur vival of a public school system. The leaders of the Demo cratic minority issued a state ment calling the entire program “a slickly packaged campaign document designed to mislead the public.” “It seeks to create an illusion of action at a critical moment in our history when people will not be deluded by pro grams that do not match the rhetoric,” the Democratic lead ers of the Assembly and Sen ate said. Republican leaders rallied to the defense and called the entire program “a brilliant blueprint for the nineteen seventies.” Governor Rockefeller stepped to the podium in the ornate Assembly chamber precisely at 1 P.M. and, for the benefits of television, read in 26 minutes highlights of a speech designed for 2 hours 15 minutes of read ing. We are here today to ex amine challenges, weigh priori ties and set goals for the nine teen‐seventies,” the Governor said, reading hurriedly. “On the basis of our past experience, with a sensitive understanding of human needs and aspirations in New York State, we must set new goals and priorities that will reflect the new condi tions that lie ahead in the seventies.” No Major Construction What followed was an out line of goals and priorities that lacked any reference to the kind of major construction pro grams so typical of past speech es by Mr. Rockefeller and no more than passing references to the special needs or prob lems of New York City. Instead, the proposals reflect ed an awareness of those things that have welled to the surface recently as the basic concerns of what President Nixon has called “the silent majority” in the country. The Governor also proposed the following things: ¶A $15‐million increase in the narcotics addiction control program to expand the use of methadone treatment of addicts in neighborhood storefronts, and a review of all drug related laws. ¶Reorganization of the Pub lic Service commission to focus solely on regulating utility com panies and the establishment of a new Consumer Protection Board in the Governor's office. ¶Revision of the state's abor tion law, which now allows abortions only to save the mother's life. Anticrime Task Force In addition to a prosecutor with statewide powers, the Governor also asked for statewide anticrime task force. The Department of Environ mental Conservation would ad minister grants to communities for waste disposal and noise control. The 21,840‐word document, the longest of the Governor's messages, urged the creation of nine new study commissions and the reorganization of 17 departments of state govern ment. For education, the Governor urged an increase in the state's share of the cost for each pupil from the present $760 to $900—at the cost of $100‐ million next year—as the first step toward 50‐50 state financ ing of primary and secondary education. The state now fi nances 46 per cent of costs up to $760 a pupil. He also pledged the state's full share of the cost of City University of New York's an nounced open‐admissions pro gram, and called for increased state aid (from the present 33 1/3 to 40 per cent) for the cost of community colleges. Universal Health Insurance Though the Governor re quested, for the fourth time in as many years, a program of universal health insurance to largely replace the Medicaid program, his limited argument for the program indicated he would mount no campaign for its enactment. He did, however, ask the Legislature to require public hearings before any rate in creases or reductions in bene fits are approved for Blue Cross and Blue Shield insurance. Governor Rockefeller re peated his complaints that the state was financially hard pressed and that any major in creases in spending could only come with increased Federal aid. “But,” the Governor noted, “last week, in an election‐year mood, the Congress cut taxes for everyone—thus not only fanning the fires of inflation, but also reducing greatly the possibility of the Federal Gov ernment's assuming its full share of responsibility for meet ing the people's needs at home.” In this tight ‐money frame work, however the G?? went on to outline more recom mendations for altering or creating programs. The Governor also told the Legislature that there was need to combine planning for increased population with de velopment of an Increased in dustrial capacity. Pointing to the dimension of these, as he sees them, twin problems the Governor said: “New York State is facing an annual deficit in its housing production in excess of 100,000 dwelling units, including units needed to accommodate popu lation growth and to replace substandard units. . . . If New York is to continue to prosper, we will need employment for the millions of citizens to be added by population increase.” In treating these as mutual needs, the Governor said he would propose a constitutional amendment to replace the ex isting housing article with new community development article. The new article is ex pected to allow state assistance in housing and industrial de velopment to ease the problems of securing land and low‐inter est development funds and ?? with res?? local zoning and land‐use controls and building codes. The Governor also will seek legislation to provide incentives to banks and insurance compa nies to invest in housing mort gages, authorize savings and loan associations and savings banks to invest in housing mortgages and rehabilitation loans, and the allocation of $50‐ million from the Housing Fi nance Agency bond authoriza tion to extend the HOPE pro gram, which extends low‐inter est loans to tenants to purchase, cooperative apartments. Automobile Congestion His emphasis on transporta tion was also one more of plan ning than of specific new‐money programs. The basic proposal would ask Connecticut and New Jersey to join him in ap pointing a commission to study a regional approach to the sub sidy of mass transportation fares—a move that could lead to a three‐state agency like the present Port of New York Au thority but oriented toward sub. sidizing the operating costs of mass transportation systems. Turning Then to cities and their g??wing proplem ?? car‐choked streets, the Gover nor proposed two programs. He called for legislation to allow the use of state trans portation funds to develop public parking facilities on the edges of urban centers in con junction with bus shuttles, plan expected to he tested in Albany to relieve parking prob lems that will he created by the South Mall state office project. And he promised “a con certed effort” to improve trans portation between smaller ur ban areas, primarily through pilot programs between undis closed communities now lack ing such interurban service. In an area of traffic safety, the Governor proposed tighter regulation of drivers. He asked for laws that would. ¶Make it unlawful on the face of it for a driver presently to operate a car with a blood alcohol content to 15 per cent. Such content presently is sub ject to interpretation. ¶Authorize periodic re‐exam inations of all drivers. ¶Make automatie the soc pension of license of a driver ?? ?? of sp??ding 20 miles an hour a?? the ??.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Psychiatry in Ferment,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/01/12/archives/psychiatry-in-ferment.html,"The century is coming to a boil and psychiatry is thor oughly immersed in the hot water. The mental health field produces far more of this heat than is generally real ized. The public is vaguely aware of differences in thera peutic approach between those using medication and those using psychotherapy, but the real agonies of so ciety today have also deeply embroiled the profession. Agon is the Greek word for competition, and the struggle is between sharply differing sets of values: ¶Is the experiential more meaningful than the rational? ¶Does spontaneous action produce solutions superior to programs and planning? ¶Should the individual re ceive primacy over the na tion, state, group, or even family? ¶Is present joy preferable to accomplishments made possible by deferring gratifi cation? ¶Ought concern with ulti mate consequences be re garded as so uncertain and paralyzing that action should be limited, concrete and im mediate? ¶Should we celebrate our total interdependence and abolish hierarchies, stratifica tions and differences based on status, experience, age or achievement? The loss of structure, the de‐struction, without de liberate substitution of alter natives is the most threaten ing aspect to those without faith in the spontaneous emergence of a new and bet ter frame of reference. In psychiatry this struggle accounts, in part, for the re vulsion against the traditional mental hospital. The present trend is toward patient‐gov ernment to set the rules: it is the patients who should care for one another and even determine the treatment needed. In group therapy, it is held that the psychiatrist or psy chologist should have no spe cial status — or better — should not even be present. In the outpatient universe it is the “indigenous personnel,” attendants, volunteers, help ers and the operative em ployes — typists, file clerks, janitors, drivers — who “truly” represent the commu nity and who therefore should make the administrative de cisions (in one case, at least, to get rid of the psychiatrist who introduced the plan). The deepest cleft has arisen as the result of the Commu nity Mental Health Center Act of 1963. About 10 per cent of the projected 2,000 centers have been functioning long enough to have produced at least a few where there is less concern over caring for mentally ill patients than with treating “a sick society” that the staff believes has produced the psychiatric dis orders. Such demonstrations as sit ins against housing authori ties, peace parades and mari juana marches are regarded as proper activities getting at the core of the problem. Without the cushioning of time and money that the Act provides in the millions of dollars earmarked for educa tion and counseling there would be even more rapid fragmentation and rigidity. The cheery observer who chooses to ignore the prob lem since “we have muddled through others just as bad” ignores two important facts. First, the excessive de mands and claims were usual ly the basis for obtaining a decent compromise, whereas today they often are really nonnegotiable and intransi gent. Second, in the past there was a saving time‐lag between places end events so that passion and even in formation was modified in the transmittal. Today there is instant everything and the is lands and nodes of stability are all but vanished. The agon is not only be tween the old and the new but between the inevitably conflicting directions in which the various innovators are driving. Rather than attempt to pull back, the very fullest support should be given to developing and backing all 2,000 Community Mental Health Centers as the germi nating source. We have no choice. The century is preg nant with this new concept and past the point of safe abortion. Decade of Dropouts The 1960's was the decade of dropouts and LSD when agents that severed the al ready tenuous ties to real ity were so prized since they made it possible to ignore a distasteful uni verse. It is not that the nar rative thread of our existence has suddenly become clear and attractive. It is rather that the apathy has been dissipated, which ac counts, in part, for insistence on participation, action, ex periencing — for doing one's own thing. Drugs that encourage a feeling of community without loss of basic reality are valued, which explains the at tractiveness of marijuana. The likelihood that the Royal Commission appointed by the Canadian Government will recommend legalization of marijuana but the stringent prohibition of LSD is appro priate to the demands of the time. Almost certainly the Federal Government will less en the severity of punish ment for possession of “pot.” Our attitude is more cau tious, but still recognizes the need for a short‐acting in toxicant more effective and less destructive than alcohol. Considerable research is re quired to determine whether marijuana or some other form of cannabis meets that need. At present we do not even have an accurate method to measure the potency of mari juana or hashish. Safe drugs as a legitimate personal op tion will gain increasing ac ceptance as the decade pro gresses. Heroin Ruled Out Experience with cocaine and heroin have at least con vinced experts that these are not the drugs of choice. Each heroin addict costs the com munity about $35,000 a year. By the end of the decade we should know how complete an answer methadone or any other medication is for this problem or for the problem of other addictions. As a final and delightful anomaly, as the decade begins, it is in psychiatry — of all the biological and so cial sciences — that com puters are demonstrating the greatest use. New York State mental hospitals and those of New England are linked in an effective network (cen tered in Rockland County) that promises to provide epi demiological data that will make possible a whole new order of both information and care. Plans to extend the net work not only to other parts of the country but to other parts of the world have been drawn. Research utilizing im planted electrodes monitored by radio‐telegraphy in both experimental animals and in humans newly exists. Closely allied techniques for evalu ating both the spontaneous chemical changes in the brain and the effect of pharmaceu ticals delivered with hypoder mic needle‐point accuracy should resolve the major questions remaining about the role of endocrines, electro lytes, enzymes and biogenic amines in depressions. Rapid and effective treatment will be available by the end of the decade,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Human Ecology and Ethics Are Inseparable,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/01/12/archives/human-ecology-and-ethics-are-inseparable.html,"The 21st century may witness a world of half‐starved, depressed human masses, gasping for air, short of sweet water, struggling to avoid the constant pres ence of one another, living at a degraded, subsistence level with all those fellow creatures that now share our planet either exterminated or domesticated and bred out of any resemblance to what they once were. Alternatively, the world of the 21st century could be a happier one in which most human beings would be better fed than at present and would have more hope for the future. Our wonderful green and blue planet would still be an abun dant and smiling home, not only for men but also for other living things. Which of these alternative futures comes true depends primarily on what we do today and during the next 20 to 30 years. We are indeed in a race with time, and time is not on our side. • We can hope that in times to come the concept of the earth as a space ship, with fixed and finite resources which must be shared by all its human pas sengers, will become ever more appar ent as population, agriculture, and in dustry grow. A growing sense of responsibility of all men for each other cannot be expect ed to flow from the unlikely well of al truism, but from the desperately prac tical fact that our very survival as men depends on working together and help ing each other. Our affluence and our technology have been largely responsible for the deterioration of the environment that has become so evident in recent years, though our growing population and our increasingly dirty habits have also played a part. New science and new technology can help us make things better. • Science can help in building the struc ture of concepts and natural laws that will enable man to understand his place in nature. Such understanding must be one basis of the moral values that should guide each human generation in exer cising its stewardship over the earth. For this purpose, ecology—the science of interactions among living things and their environment — is central. Human societies and their total environment form the highest and most complex level of ecological integration. Advances in the still rudimentary sci ence of human ecology depend in part on mutual understanding and coopera tion among social and natural scientists and humanists, and in part on the de velopment of new methods for studying interacting processes in complex systems. These systems are, in fact, so com plex that they cannot be thought through in the unaided human brain. The devel opment of large, high‐speed computers may have come just in time to extend our intellectual capacities so that such systems can be at least partially under stood. Environmental problems usually in volve conflicts of interest among indi viduals or groups and complex combi nations of gains and losses. One role of the economist is to intro duce as much rationality as possible into striking a balance between these gains and losses. His difficulty is that the in vention of tools for economic measure ment of human sensory or emotional de light and deprivation Is at an early stage. • Some pollution effects can be priced — for example, the costs of soot re moval and sand blasting of buildings, extra laundry and dry cleaning bills in a smoky city, or the accelerated deterio ration of rubber tires and nylon stock ings caused by sulphur oxides where high‐sulphur coal is the principal fuel. But how much is it worth to have a beautiful view of the city from a high building? What value can be placed on the priceless California redwoods? The intrinsic worth of clean outside air to society is obvious. But no one can buy or sell any part of it, and hence no mar ket can emerge and no values, in the economic sense, can be established. It is easy to see that the economists' rational analysis must be supplemented by political action; yet there are numer ous difficulties here. These include un certainly among many about what they really want, political passions, inability of many people to perceive their en vironment, the complexities of most en vironmental questions, and the difficul ties of formulating the issues in such a way that they can be put to a yes‐or no vote. Clearly, there Is a role for education in dealing with the maintenance and im provement of environmental quality. • In this respect, the functions of edu cation are three‐fold: production of the many kinds of specialists who will be required to deal professionally with the problems, formulation and inculcation of the moral and intellectual values on which environmental improvement must rest and creation of a heightened sen sitivity among young people to the world around them—the ability to use their senses, and to respond to what they perceive. To preserve and improve our environ ment, many things must be done, much money must be spent, and many hard choices made. Fundamental to all else are a new ethical attitude toward our own land And limitation of our own hu man numbers. Historically, generations of white, Anglo‐Sexon Americans have had no doubt that it was their duty to increase and mutiply so that they might take dominion over the continent. Our domin ion has been a harsh one for our fellow creatures. While our own numbers have risen from four million in 1790 to more than 200 million today, many other species have been extinguished or drastically reduced. The wood bison and woodland cari bou are gone; American elk and gray wolves roam no more through the east ern forests, nor do the giant herds of bison graze on the prairies; Guadalupe petrels, masked bobwhites, heath hens, passenger pigeons, and sand‐shoal ducks have all followed the great auks to ex tinction. Swallowtail kites, whooping cranes, prairie chickens, California condors — even our national symbol, the bald eagle — are struggling to survive, as are moose and red wolves, lynx, bobcats, cougars, and more than a hundred other species. • A sad and cautionary tale, but per haps an inevitable part of a unique event in history — the creation within a scant 300 years by a nation of egali tarian Puritans, of a continent‐spanning, world‐bestriding colossus of a country. To create a new land ethic, we need to return to the sense of awe and kin ship for the natural world that charac terized both primitive man and our in tellectual ancestors, the Greeks. Our aim should be not to control nature, but to live in harmony with it. We need especially to conserve for the greatest public good such limited re sources as the coastal shoreline, estuar ies, and wetlands. Above all, we need to preserve diversity. The public good should be paramount in the use of land, but private rights must be respected. A new land ethnic must be accompanied by practical de vices to compensate property owners for the constraints Imposed on their free use of their own land. • In thinking about the future popula tion size of the United States, two basic premises are clear: quality is inescapably related to quantity, and we must bal ance our numbers against our ability to provide human services and a human environment for all our citizens. No one can say today what the opti mum size of the United States popula tion should be, but we know that we already have human resources in excess of our present ability to use them fully as human beings. The growth of our numbers exacer bates every environmental problem: the dull ugliness of our cities, the deteriora tion of natural areas, the increase of ecological imbalances, the depletion of natural resources, the growth of ur ban pathology, and the proliferation of noxious wastes. Though man is the most adaptable of animals, we need to remember that our physiological character, sensory capaci ties, and behavior patterns evolved in a sparsely populated world. Our continu ally growing numbers demand an ever increasing complexity of interactions and produce a multiplication of stimuli that could overwhelm our inherited ca pacities. At least until we learn more about ourselves and can use our knowledge to ensure lives of happiness and fulfillment for all our fellow citizens, control of population growth must be a high‐prior ity national goal, fostered by govern ment policies and programs. Before adopting a particular policy to reduce fertility, government leaders need to ask themselves several kinds of ques tions, including whether the policy is po litically acceptable to most people, and how effective it will be. • But the most fundamental questions are ethical ones: Will the policy enhance the freedom of human beings as indivi viduals, and will it advance justice for all human beings as members of society? These two ethical ideals of individual freedom and distributive justice often are, or seem to be, more or less incom patible. The task of law‐givers throughout his tory, however, has been to strike a workable balance between them. So it must be with the establishment of pop ulation policy. Family planning programs, designed to give full freedom to individual couples to determine the number of their chil dren and the spacing between births, are matters of free choice. Repeal of laws restricting abortion and free availability of medically safe abortions would fur ther enhance the freedom of individual women and of married couples. But the freedom of husbands and wives to make reproductive decisions must be tempered by concern for the rights and interest of others. The first and most obvious interest to be pro tected is that of the children already born within the family. The birth of ad ditional children may affect them ad versely in a variety of ways. Next come all other members of so ciety whose economic welfare and social well‐being are lessened by rapid popula tion growth, and the younger and sub sequent generations, whose opportuni ties will be diminished by the economic stagnation and loss of amenities caused by this growth. Finally, the interests of other nations and societies must be taken into the ac count because all nations ultimately make demands on the same pool of re sources. Governments have an obligation to protect the interests of all these groups. One of the most difficult of population questions is to think through and justify policies and procedures to accomplish this end.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Extremes Meet at the Chapel Of Unorthodox Sydney Pastor,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/01/18/archives/extremes-meet-at-the-chapel-of-unorthodox-sydney-pastor.html,"SYDNEY, Australia, Jan. 17 —A barefoot couple in hippie garb awaiting their turn at the altar watched Flight Lieut. Ian Maxwell Bryant of the Royal Australian Air Force and his bride, the former Nannette Shirleen Gwin of Reno, emerge beneath the traditional arch of swords held by the bride groom's fellow officers.  The officer in formal dress uniform and the waiting long haired bridegroom smiled at each other and exchanged congratulations. “It could happen only at the Wayside Chapel,” the Rev. Ted Noffs, the Methodist officiating minister at both weddings, said one recent afternoon. Though he often wears a Rotary Club button on his neat gray suits and only recently let the sideburns of his con ventional haircut grow an extra inch or so, the 43‐year‐old pastor of the Wayside Chapel is known among Sydney's avant‐garde youth as the “with it” preacher. When Mr. Noffs founded the Wayside Chapel six years ago in the vice‐ridden Kings Cross district, he put on old clothes and toured the beatnik, now hippie, hangouts to recruit a congregation. A Controversial Figure His subsequent involvement with drug addicts, prostitutes, homosexuals and other uncon ventional elements of Sydneyl. society has made Mr. Noffs a controversial figure in the Aus tralian religious world, which he has described as “one of the most conservative ecclesiastical environments in the world.” Mr. Noffs, whose assignments have ranged from a tour in the desolate hinterland to a three‐year appointment as pas tor of the Wesleyan Church in Chicago, often enrages the or thodox hierarchy here with challenges to the religious es tablishment. “It is patently obvious that within the church many of our ecclesiastical structures are so antiquated that they are of lit tle value to humanity any more,” he declared in his re cently published memoir en titled “The Wayside Chapel.” “They merely preserve ghet tos which . . . reflect only a caricature of the Christian com munity,” he continued. “These structures must go, but what is corning is infinitely more exciting than what Is going.” The Wayside Chapel, “as a catalyst in society . . . is a pointer toward a coining ‘new reformation’ in Christianity,” Mr. Noffs insisted. Still in the same tiny space where he started in a con verted two‐story apartment house on a plot 70 feet by 90 feet, Mr. Noffs by ingenious de signing has surrounded the original 60‐seat chapel with of fices, consulting rooms, a cof fee shop and a 300‐seat theater. He says that the theater has done “more good than hundreds of sermons.” The Sunday night discussion meetings, in which anyone may speak, pack the theater. Besides youths ranging from well spoken student leaders to leather‐jacketed members of motorcycle gangs, the meetings are attended by many older people including local celebri‐, ties and liberal intellectuals such as Prof. Charles Birch of Syd ney University. A sprinkling of American servicemen on leave from Vietnam is usually in the audience. Freer Abortion Law Urged Mr. Noffs, while opposing abortion in principle and be cause of psychic consequences, nevertheless advocates freer abortion laws because “any girl who wants an abortion can and will get one around Kings Cross for $150.” Although a teetotaler himself, he fights the liquor regulations that discriminate against the, brown‐skinned peoples of Aus tralia on the ground of social inequality. On the drug‐addiction prob lem, he is known equally for militancy against drug use and sympathy with victims of the traffic. Mr. Noffs has reacted spiritedly to the frequent taunt of conservative clerics that the Wayside Chapel coffee shop, where addicts are welcome, is, exploited by pushers, who are said to find a ready clientele there. While asserting that the sub stance of the charge is small since he believes known pushers would be more inclined to avoid a place where they might be spotted, he argues that “the most exploited person in human history was the founder of the Christian religion” and that “exploitability should therefore be a characteristic of the Chris tian involvement with the world.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Point of View,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/01/19/archives/point-of-view-indias-central-problem-is-how-to-improve-ratio-of.html,"INDIA'S central problem for the next several decades is to improve the ratio of food to people. In greater or lesser degree, this applies to almost all the countries of South and Southeast Asia. In size, and perhaps in severity, India's problem is the most difficult and the most significant.  The ratio can be improved either by decreasing the rate of population growth, increas ing the rate of agricultural growth, or both. India is try ing both. Family planning shares top priority with agriculture in Indian Government alloca tions of funds. The term “family planning” persists as a euphemism for population control although India cor rectly sees the problem as having long since passed the stage of helping mothers to space their childbirths. The shrill tone that typifies the predictions of Western demographers has found an echo in the eloquence of Health Minister Margathum Chandrasekhar's espousal of birth control by any and all means: condoms, pessaries, loops, pills, vasectomies, rais ing the legal age of marriage and easing the laws against abortion. • But the birth rate in India is not likely to turn down for many years—perhaps a dec ade. Neither religion nor mon ey are obstacles. But tradi tion; the belief in large fam ilies as a form of social secur ity; low levels of literacy; the 75 per cent rural character of the population and the se rious shortcomings of all pres ent contraceptive techniques, present intractable problems of motivation, communi cation, administration, and effectiveness. Moreover, such success as will occur in promoting con traception will be concealed by the changing age composi tion of the population. Success in reducing infant and child mortality during the last 15 years now results in a sharp increase in the proportion of women of childbearing age in the total population. This tends to increase births per thousand, offsetting contra ception. No dramatic drop in birth rates, therefore, can be ex pected until a radical Improvement in contraceptive technique becomes available. The most likely candidate now under clinical test is the hypodermic injection of a slowly soluble capsule which, for a predetermined period, either prevents ovulation or inhibits fertilization after ovulation. Such a technique would open the way for mass inoc ulation campaigns similar to those for smallpox. But further research and testing is required to eliminate side effects, guarantee certitude, and assure reversibility. In the meantime, therefore, India's principal hope lies in increasing agricultural out put. The recipe for doing so is at hand. Originally called the “Intensive Agricultural District Program,” its success has awarded it the journalis tic label of “The Green Rev olution.” Contrasting sharply with the earlier Community Development Program, which tended to disperse scarce re sources over all 500,000 vil lages, the district program concentrates on one district in each state. When one dis trict is thoroughly covered, a new district is taken on. • This program guarantees to all the cultivators in a dis trict the inputs required to assure increases in output in the order of 50 percent to 150 percent. Typical Indian production per acre is so low that spectacular increases are entirely feasible. But such revolutionary changes require not only intensive preliminary demonstration, planning and training for each individual farmer, but also that all of the components of the pack age be delivered on time and in the right amount. The size and skill of administration re quired is formidable. The principal elements of the “package” are water, new high‐yielding seeds, fertilizer suitable for local soils, pesti cides, labor to meet peak re quirements, credit at econom ic interest rates, farm‐to‐mar ket roads, drying and stor age facilities, truck and rail transport, incentive prices, and floor prices. Few if any districts receive high marks in meeting all of these tests. But all have done well enough during the last two seasons, including one good and one bad monsoon, to pull up the all‐India an nual agricultural growth rate to something like 5 or 6 per cent—well ahead of the birth rate. To sustain this rate of growth, four things are indis pensable: at least some politi cal stability; a pragmatic agricultural research pro gram; an increase in domestic savings and outside help in assuring adequate foreign ex change. The first three, for better or worse, lie within India's control. The fourth is in the hands of world politics. • There is a strong probabil ity that the central govern ment and most of the states will be at least sufficiently stable for the near future to assure continuity of pres ent agricultural policies. This probability is buttressed by the fact that in many states political power is moving toward the larger farmers who are the principal beneficiaries of the initial phases of the district pro gram. Regardless of the outcome of Prime Minister Indira Gan dhi's struggle to rejuvenate or at least control the Con gress party, there are already strong vested interests in both wings of the party supporting current agricultural policies. Unhappily, the thrust of the Government's program will be diminished not only by the dissipation of energy in the conflict at the center, but by unrest and occasional vio lence among the agricultural wage‐workers and small ten ants who have not shared in the gains of the Green Rev olution and whose frustrated hopes fertilize the efforts of Red agitators. If Mrs. Gandhi has the Imagination and power to or ganize these frustrations into labor‐intensive rural improve ment programs, she could broaden her political base, add to the effectiveness of the district program and at the same time tighten the labor market so that some of the productivity gains could be captured by higher farm wages without directly chal lenging the big farmers. • The task of meeting the demand for pragmatic agri cultural research lies well within India's competence if her agricultural universities, colleges, and research sta tions focus their talents upon it. Some institutions, such as the universities at Ludhiana in the Punjab, and Pantnagar in Uttar Pradesh, have al ready made the grade. Others are close behind, and still others may gradually be stirred out of their paralysis. There will be well publicized local disasters— from undiagnosed soil defici encies; from insects; and from fungus, virus, and bacteria that thrive upon tenderfoot intruders into the domain of varieties toughened by a thousand years of survival se lection. But on the average, India's scientists should be able, despite the brain drain, to keep ahead of the pests. � India's level of economic poverty is so low that savings come very hard—even though there is a small number of very rich who could afford to save and put more to pro ductive use than they do. The principal hope of additional savings lies in the rising pro ductivity of agriculture and stimulus that this will provide to the fuller use of industrial capacity already installed, and of labor reserves persis tently underemployed. There are recent signs that these savings are already forthcoming, but they are not measurable. One of the clear est of these signs is the move ment of absentee landlords back from the city to operate and invest their savings in their farms. Spot studies of specific villages also show the phenomenon of savings coming out of nooks and crannies to provide the capi tal necessary for more pro ductive agriculture. It would help a great deal if the states—in which the constitutional authority to do so resides — had the will to tax away part of the gains from the district program and use the proceeds to refuel the program. In general, they have not. Indeed the compe tion for political popularity between the Congress party and its opposition has placed a premium, in recent years, on lowering land taxes. This trend will have to be re versed if the growth of agriculture and the industrial inputs on which it depends to be sustained. But even if India's internal savings rate were in fact rap idly rising, it would still be dependent, at critical mar gins, upon foreign exchange, foreign investment and for eign assistance. • To sustain the Green Revo lution, India must import fertilizer until its own rapidly growing capacity can meet its needs. To supply its own fer tilizer production, India must import machinery and tech nical skills. In all requisites except potassium, India could go it alone. But the going would be too slow to be politically tolerable and to keep food ahead of popula tion. In addition to these indis pensables, India needs to im port small amounts of critical metals, replacement parts and initial components that it cannot now produce, de spite the extraordinary vir tuosity of Indian industry. These imports could be paid for by exports, by foreign pri vate investment, or by for eign public loans and grants. Exports are growing, sur prisingly well, but not fast enough. Private investment, with a hope and a prayer, may take care of developing the capacity to produce fertilizer, refine petroleum, and pro mote sulphur and phosphate extraction. But in spite of strict import controls; export promotion; an overdose of im port substitution and foreign private investment, there will still be a foreign exchange gap of about $1.5‐billion dur ing the coming year. Half a billion of this is in terest and repayments on ear lier loans. A postponement of these obligations would re duce the gap to a billion. The World Bank and non‐United States members of the Aid India Club could—and prob ably would—pick up about half of this, leaving $500‐mil lion to the United States. Although India is the larg est recipient of United States assistance, it is at the bottom of the list on a per capita basis. Excluding surplus food, the largest annual con tribution—four years ago — was $430‐million — 80 cents a head. The political pros pects for aid to India this year are in the vicinity of $200‐million—less than half the needed amount. India desperately wants to be independent of foreign as sistance, and is too proud to beg. But the Green Revolu tion, which for the first time in 20 years provides ground for hope, cannot be sustained without our help. United States “commitments” in three tiny countries — Laos, Thailand and Vietnam—make It unlikely that we will pro vide the necessary margin to give substance to the hopes of one‐sixth of the human race.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Trudeau without the Trudeaumania—,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/01/25/archives/trudeau-without-the-trudeaumania-canadas-pm-is-not-a-simple-swinger.html,"OTTAWA. ONE evening last spring, Gordon Fairweather, a member of Par liament, left the House of Com mons and strolled along Parliament Hill, enjoying the early flowers and the release from winter harshness. It was a quiet evening, and the collec tion of gray sandstone Gothic build ings looked unusually peaceful in the dusk. Fairweather, suddenly, was startled to see the Prime Minister, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, walking to ward him. No one else was around, not even the Royal Canadian Mounted Police plainclothesman who normally accompanies the Prime Minister wher ever he goes. Trudeau was on his way from his office in the East Block to the other office in the Centre Block, which he uses when the Commons is in session. Fairweather, who had known Trudeau since his days as an ordinary M.P., had shared a bond as a fellow lawyer and upholder of civil liberties and, even though a member of a rival political party, had always admired and respected him. “Prime Minister,” said Fairweather, “do they allow you out alone now?” Fairweather does not remember the precise reply, but he says he will not forget the meaning of the gesture when Trudeau shrugged his shoulders. It was as if to say, “I wish it were so.” Fairweather experienced a pow erful sense of empathy, for here was Trudeau, an intensely individualistic person who in the past managed to escape periodically to a mountain retreat, Thoreau‐style, to meditate alone, trying to cling to a moment of privacy. His brief flight in the spring was from a post that had made him a captive, but, typical of the enigma of Trudeau, no longer a reluctant one. MORE recently, an interviewer found Trudeau in his Centre Block office—a formal, stiff setting—with the Prime Minister dressed appropri ately in a dark suit. His collar was unbuttoned, his tie askew. This was not merely a concession to compro mise. It was, instead, quite in keeping with Trudeau's innate conservatism yet demand for personal freedom. For the man who has on occasion worn an ascot and open sandals in the House of Commons, or—attired in white tie and tails—slid down the banister of Lancaster House, a British government mansion in London, there is no intrinsic contradiction between uninhibited behavior and a dedication to a solid, safe approach to govern ment. Besides, he slides down banisters to demonstrate he is physically fit. Trudeau is bewitched by a mark of vanity. But it is not necessarily about his formidable intellect, an I.Q. of 180 and an erudition piled up at l'Universite de Montreal, Harvard, the London School of Economics and l'Ecole des Sciences Politiques, Paris. It is, rather, about his age—he is 50—and his determination to keep forever youthful and athletic. If there is a contradiction it exists chiefly in the minds of those electors who chose Trudeau because they visualized him as a swinger, a wealthy bachelor who takes out daz zling actresses half his age, who arrived on the political front late but who would help Canada eliminate its image of stolidity. Things have not worked exactly that way, and the disenchanted include intellectuals who thought Trudeau would animate the country with radical social and economic reforms. Trudeau, as the 18 months since his election as Prime Minister have confirmed, is neither a simple swinger nor a radical re former. Nor is it entirely right to dismiss the story ingenuously, as he himself attempted to do when he told his interviewer, “I am just trying to set myself up as some kind of modest efficiency expert in government.” Trudeau is a complex mixture, a man to himself and comparable to no other political figure. He has been called patrician, autocratic, cold, self protective and mysterious. He may be all of these, but he is also charming, warm, carefree, open, modest—and shy. Gordon Fairweather, who, as a Conservative spokesman, finds it difficult to criticize Trudeau, quotes a description once given by Lord Hal dane, the British statesman, of Prime Minister Asquith — too much head, and not enough “fire in his belly.” To a degree, it fits Trudeau. He has shown him self venturesome in foreign pol icy, but cautious in domestic affairs, prompting Fairweather and others to suggest that they would welcome more of a gambler and less of a pre cision‐maker in Trudeau. He has given Canada its most efficient govern ment in modern times. In the process, he has kept pace with the enormous growth of administrative needs by expanding the staff and apparatus of the Prime Minister's office, so that today it is twice as big as that of his predecessor, Lester Pearson. TRUDEAU has been able to con centrate on the housekeeping and mechanics of management because he has been under no compulsion to deliver promptly on campaign prom ises—for the good reason that there were‐ no specific campaign promises. Such was the enchantment of Tru deaumania in 1968 that he had no difficulty leading the Liberals into election victory as Canada's first majority government in six years. He did so on the strength of vaguely worded and philosophic approaches to national unity and regional dispari ty in the face of growing separatism in Quebec and a persistent gap be tween the affluent and poor provinces. There has been some improvement in English‐French relations, but less marked success in the fight against economic inequalities. This is not unintentional. In Trudeau's mind, na tional unity held priority, for without it there would be no country and consequently no other program could carry meaning. And in the deliberate ly calculated timetable of the techno crats with whom Trudeau has sur rounded himself, the cutting of gov ernment expenses would have to precede the spending of more money. “The goodies”—as his principal aide, Marc Lalonde, puts it—will come later, by 1972. Trudeau, whom France's Jean Jacques Servan‐Schreiber, editor‐pub lisher of L'Express, has called “the first really modern politician in the West,” has no doubts about the va lidity of his approach. “We're setting up machinery which will permit us to deal with the important and not only the urgent,” he says. He has set up a multitude of study groups and task forces to delve into almost every aspect of Canadian life, from agriculture to the welfare structure, from constitutional revision to pub lic information. In the past session of Parliament, 10 white papers were introduced, compared with an aver age of two or three in previous gov ernments. It suits a computerized age, and its suits Trudeau's own personal ity. The result is an effusion in efforts, though not always in warmth. One of the lieutenants in the Prime Minister's office, who worked previ ously for Pearson, confesses there was more excitement in the old days: “It was like being in an ancient DC‐3 with Pearson the pilot, a grin on his face, flying by the seat of his pants —coming in for a landing with the wings wobbling, clipping hedges, but always touching down safely. Now it's like being in a DC‐8, landing on instruments, everything efficient and calm—and impersonal.” THERE is a feeling here that, Lord Acton notwith standing, power instead of corrupting Trudeau has made him more tolerant and subdued, as though he is aware of the limitations of any individual in the face of eco nomic and social and political realities. A man who has worked closely with him for many years—previously when Trudeau was teaching law at l'Université de Montréal, and more recently when he be came Justice Minister and Prime Minister — says, “Ten years ago he was, intellectual ly, an arrogant bastard. Now he has learned humility.” At Cabinet meetings decorum is stiffer than it was under Pearson, but Trudeau presides much as a professor at a seminar. He arrives with a message containing perhaps three main points—the maxi mum, as any good lecturer knows, that can be absorbed in a single sitting. Trudeau makes his points, then listens to the discussions that ensue, in a technique that may have its origin in his Jesuit classical college training in Montreal— of not imposing views on oth ers but letting them find their way to your position. In re sponse to items raised by ministers, Trudeau frequently and candidly confesses he is not sure what action should be taken. He heeds arguments, does not necessarily act by consensus but has a knack for selecting the best reason offered around the table. In the easy‐going Pearson administration, Cabinet leaks were frequent. Trudeau has imposed a ruling that no dis closures may be made to the news media—largely on the ground that these are designed to build the reputation of one minister at the expense of another. The prohibition has worked to a remarkable degree, and there have been no revela tions of a substantive nature. Once, Bryce Mackasey, the capable and strong Minister of Labor, who had been out of town and missed a couple of meetings, was asked by Trudeau to relate to the Cabi net the latest developments in a strike by grain handlers in the port of Vancouver, B. C. Mackasey said that on the basis of a quick fill‐in from his deputies, he could report that all was well and there was no need for concern. Jean Luc Pepin, Minister of Trade and Commerce, broke in to say this was not so, that according to his information there was grave dislocation. Mackasey conceded that Pepin was speaking accurately, but he had thought it prudent to make an optimistic statement before the Cabinet; his inten tion was to tell the Prime Minister the gloomier facts later in private. A tense silence descended, the other Ministers watching for reac tion from Trudeau, whom they knew to like frank discus sions. Then Trudeau said icily, “Mr. Mackasey, in your ab sence there have been no Cabinet leaks.” TRUDEAU, at Cabinet meet ings, can exhibit a boyish sense of humor. At one ses sion, he was scheduled to leave at 12:20 P.M., in order to attend a formal lunch at 12:30. As the deadline arrived after a lengthy debate, a Minister said, “If I had the time, I could present two other points to support my case.” Trudeau, whose high cheeks seem to reflect a spe cial glow when he feels imp ish, grinned and said, “But you haven't the time.” In the House of Commons he is less whimsical. Just as he is impatient or ill at ease with small talk, he appears awkward and bored with pre pared statements. He delivers fewer of them than any of his recent predecessors, and when he does, it is in a dull, classroom style. He becomes alive during a question period, when his intellect is chal lenged. He can give a bright, satisfactory answer — or en gage in debate in impressive style—and then alienate ev eryone by being contemptu ously sarcastic. Last July, during a particularly bitter exchange, some M.P.'s shouted, “Heil Hitler.” Trudeau retali ated with such vindictive per sonal assaults that several members walked out of the chamber in protest. Trudeau urged them on: “I think we should encourage members of the Opposition to leave. Every time they do, the I.Q. of this house rises considerably.” Such haughtiness distresses old hands, among them David Lewis, deputy leader of the socialist New Democratic par ty and probably the finest parliamentary performer of all. “When I look across the aisle from time to time,” Lewis commented in the House, “and observe the dis dain with which the Prime Minister treats Parliament, and the way he looks at us in the Opposition, I often say to myself: there, but for the grace of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, sits God.” The people around Trudeau defend him pointing to his high target of perfection and idealism. He respects the parliamentary process — they argue—but has no tolerance for members whom he consid ers to reduce its level. Parlia ment, according to his view, should imply a lofty discus sion of principles, of white papers, of the philosophy of politics. But to men like Lewis there is a disturbing inability in Trudeau to understand that Parliament in a real sense represents the people, medioc rities as well as geniuses. Members, like their constit uents, are average mortals with hang‐ups and parochial interests. Lewis, during the election campaign, described Trudeau as “a suspended brain.” Now he adds, “Time has proved it a not invalid description.” Lewis, whom some corre spondents judge to hold the most sagacious insight into Trudeau, says: “On the whole, he has not been, so far, an innovative Prime Minister. He talks the language of change but doesn't show he feels it. He's a highly intelligent 19th century liberal with an obses sion for civil liberties which is 25 years behind the times.” TRUDEAU'S preoccupation with civil liberties does indeed go back a quarter of a century, to the regime of Maurice Du plessis, who as Premier of Quebec in the nineteen‐forties and fifties ruled with semi dictatorial and repressive laws which Trudeau fought as a lawyer and co‐founder of an outspoken review of opinion, Cite Libre. The mark of those years lingers in his wariness of political figures in Quebec, a province that has long shown a proclivity to authori tarianism. Thus today he is deeply committed to the es tablishment of an effective bill of rights that would cut across the rigidly held prerogatives of the provinces and become entrenched in a federal consti tution. His achievements in office up to now reflect this key to his character, his concern for the legal rights of the indi vidual. A bill reforming the criminal code, introduced when Trudeau was Justice Minister and enacted when he was Prime Minister, eases the abortion laws and legalizes homosexual acts in private be tween consenting adults. In one of his most celebrated statements, he said: “The state has no place in the bedrooms of the nation.” In similar fash ion, Canada under Trudeau appears to be moving toward liberalization of marijuana laws. Trudeau's feeling for indiv idual rights is also discerned in his stand on political or military refugees. Canada was always lenient in allowing entry to draft resisters. But for a period there was ambi guity regarding American mil itary deserters. It was left to the discretion of Canadian im migration officials at border points whether or not to admit deserters. Frequently the de serters were not only turned back, but were greeted by U.S. authorities, ready to arrest them, on tipoffs from Cana dian Immigration people. Un der the Trudeau Administra tion, the policy was clarified last May. Immigration men at the border no longer possess the power to forbid entry to an American simply because he is a deserter. His military status is not taken into ac count when Canadian Immi gration officers assess his admissibility. On the lower level, United States Immigra tion and military officials may be unhappy, but the State De partment has made no repre sentations to the Canadian Government—largely, it is as sumed, because the United States remembers how it pro vided sanctuary to Canadian deserters after Canada went to war in 1939, before the U.S. involvement. THE trend extends into the foreign field. Trudeau's steps toward recognition of Commu nist China came after a pro tracted analysis of whether Canada should have a two China policy, a one‐China‐one‐ Formosa policy, or continue a line of ambiguity that would please Washington. Now nego tiations with the Chinese are leading unequivocally to the recognition of Peking as the government of China. This is not inconsistent with Tru deau's attitudes about the world based on trips as a private citizen to China, be fore and after the Communist takeover, to Palestine during the 1948 war, to Indochina during the French war, to Cuba after Castro's entry into Havana, and to other areas in transition. The decision to cut back on NATO—half of Canada's forces will be withdrawn start ing next June—is part also of Trudeau's belief in facing re ality and “the challenge of future world social and politi cal events.” He expressed his views a few months after tak ing office: “I am very con cerned that the Canadian gov ernment, through its own poli cies and through influence on its friends and allies, should get people to understand that we are not so much threatened by fascist or Communist ide ologies or even nuclear bombs as by the fact that two‐thirds of the world goes to bed hun gry every night.” IN the 18 months of Tru deau's Premiership, Quebec representation has unques tionably shot up. In the Prime Minister's office (or P.M.O., as Canadians say), nearly half of the senior members are French‐speaking, inspiring Western M.P.'s to refer, not always in good nature, to the “French Mafia” taking over. However, the important point, in a country where the French number one in four, is not statistical. It is that all the personnel in the P.M.O., whether French‐speaking or English‐speaking in origin, are bilingual. Conversations begin in one language and end in the other. Equally important is the passage of a bill that makes French, as well as Eng lish, the official language of Canada, so that French Cana dians, in communities outside Quebec, can have access to federal institutions, such as courts, in their mother tongue. The provinces, with education under their control, generally have indicated goodwill by expanding the teaching of French. It is in Quebec itself that Trudeau has drawn the sharp est lines. For several years various gradations existed be tween “separatism” and “fed eralism,” confusing many peo ple into believing the province could achieve a highly privi leged special status within confederation. But Trudeau, in a deliberately calculated push, has forced polarization. “The fuzziness has gone,” he says. At least provincial Liberal leaders have been impelled to stand up and declare them selves “federalists.” In other parties, the issue is less clear, and separatism itself has a vocal following. But in the overall, Trudeau's strategy is working. A Gallup poll of last November showed his popu larity among French Canadi ans—always high—had risen compared with a year ago, even if, in the same period, it had dropped among English Canadians. A principal reason for dis enchantment is that Trudeau has not done much in the field of social welfare or in attacking the large patches of poverty that remain in an affluent society. Canada con tains its Appalachias, particu larly in parts of eastern Que bec and in the Atlantic pro vinces, where there are twice as many low‐income families proportionately as in Ontario. Ottawa has established ma chinery for regional expansion and investment, but with neg ligible results. AS for the general weal—in a country that long has been mindful of welfarism, with children's allowances and old age pensions for all, state‐paid hospitalization for all, and spreading medicare regardless of age—Marc Lalonde has an answer. The 40‐year‐old La londe, who sometimes is iden tified as Trudeau's Ted Soren sen, speaks much as Trudeau: “Government by magic or magicians in the world is over. Look at France. After de Gaulle, the country settled down to steady government and to tackle practical eco nomic problems. As soon as we've got the money, you'll see where the goodies go—to the underprivileged and home less, and the start will be within the next two years. But we won't resort to gimmicks. We'd rather be thrown out of office.” A clue perhaps is contained in a white paper on taxation that envisages a better break for low‐income groups. Tru deau people also promise that another white paper on social policy, scheduled for release early this year, will grab the imagination of youth and re formers and others who say that Trudeau—a millionaire's son who never experienced in security—lacks gut feeling for people's everyday needs. One of his aides admits that “it will be very hard for us to defuse this bit about Trudeau lacking humanity.” No one has proved that Trudeau is callous. Part of the trouble is his own impatience or flippancy in responding to serious questions. During the election campaign, the leader of the Conservative party, Robert Stanfield, called for a limited form of a guaranteed annual income; it was a vague promise but nonetheless indi cated an effort to get at a growing issue. Trudeau shot back that Canada had “enough of this free stuff.” Then, typi cally, when he became Prime Minister, he ordered a wide study on welfare which could result in a guaranteed annual income. On another occasion, soon after the election, Ron Col lister, a television reporter for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, awaited Trudeau when he emerged from the East Block. Also attending restlessly was a crowd of tour ists, among them teen‐age girls seeking his autograph or a buss on the cheek. Collister edged his way in to ask the Prime Minister about Canada's position on Biafra. Trudeau, trying to brush aside the re porter in the midst of an untidy melee, and obviously not realizing he was being re corded, said facetiously, “Bi afra? Where's that?” It came out on television screens across Canada and looked ter rible—Trudeau, so soon after confirmation in office, sur rounded by giggling girls and appearing frivolous. Editorial ists continue to fling the re mark at him. TRUDEAU long has har bored a disdain for most journalists, and his relations with the press have been spotty. He grants few inter views, but reporters know they can sometimes stop him for a minute or two of com ment when he leaves the House of Commons or a con ference room. He has no patience with trivial or per sonal questions. When a re porter asked him, “in the public interest,” how large his fortune was, Trudeau just shrugged and said, “How rich is rich?” But at other times he loses his temper. A notable example of this occurred in London in January, 1969, during a Com monwealth Prime Ministers' conference. Trudeau had made the rounds of some of Lon don's fashionable spots in the company of an actress, Jen nifer Hales, or of Mrs. Eva Rittinghausen, a blond who proclaimed her determination to marry the Prime Minister. Then, unexpectedly, Trudeau lit into correspondents, accus ing them of invading his pri vacy and that of his compan ions by phoning them to ask questions. He said reporters were guilty of “pretty crummy behavior” and made a half threat of instructing police to them. The press promptly fired back, pointing out that if Trudeau really wanted to keep his personal activities private he had no business selecting such places as Annabel's, Lon don's most glittering disco theque, on the regular beat of gossip columnists, where peo ple go to see and be seen. He could have chosen with more discretion. If he insisted on such exhibitionism—commen tators said—why did he resent it when the news media catered to his ego? The answer partly is that Trudeau is an odd blend. If not precisely an exhibitionist, he is unafraid of displaying his zest for airplanes, fast cars, leather coats, young women and breezy one‐liners. (Was he, he was asked on be coming Prime Minister, going to give up his Mercedes? “Which one,” he replied, “the car or the girl?”) Then, just as quickly, he can demonstrate exquisite delicacy of timing and style. On a campaign trip out West, where he was busily assaulted by teen‐agers who wanted one of his famous pecks on the cheek, a photog rapher, spotting him chatting with a handsome woman in her 30's, shouted, “Kiss her.” Trudeau obviously sensed her sophistication, held his hands together in veneration, Hindu style, and bowed to her. More recently, a Montreal woman who had done some committee work for him a couple of years before, walked up to him at a reception and said, “Remember me?” She was an attractive, green‐eyed brunette, and Trudeau said, “How could I ever forget you, my dear?” Plainly he did not remember her, and she said she felt silly on reflection but grateful he had not let her down. TRUDEAU has lost much of the patrician manner which once branded him. At a Lib eral fund‐raising dinner re cently he went from table to table shaking hands with strangers—an act he would have considered repulsive a few years ago. At the St. Mary's ball in Montreal, he danced with each of the two dozen debutantes, and took his seat, when a young girl came over and said, Could she ask a favor? A dance—not with her but with her grand mother? Trudeau rose and said, “On one condition—that you'll dance with me, too.” The gracious touch, how ever, can swiftly turn the other way. Last October, when Montreal constituents held a reception in honor of Tru deau's birthday, a radio re porter approached him and said, “Prime Minister, may I talk with you?” “Why not?” Trudeau said. “How does it feel to be 50?” the reporter asked. Trudeau, who was hold ing a drink, took a long sip, smiled benignly and said, “Will you — off!” It is hard to know whether sensitivity about his age re lates to his insatiable demand for privacy in personal mat ters or to touches of vanity. Certainly his physical daring has been highly publicized: he has swum the Bosporus, climbed mountains, undertak en canoe expeditions in the Arctic and earned a brown belt in judo. This month, es caping temporarily from pub lic affairs, he spent a week skin‐diving in the Gulf of Mexico on the British Hon duras coast and from there flew off to a week's skiing in the French Alps. He regards athletic chal lenges seriously. To get in shape for the official kickoff in the 1968 Grey Cup game— Canada's classic East‐West football championship — Tru deau took coaching in punt ing from a member of his staff, Vic Chapman, formerly of the British Columbia Lions. But his big moment, in Toron to, was ruined when the ball popped into a crowd of pho tographers 10 yards away. Trudeau didn't take well to the jibes, and for last Novem ber's Grey Cup game, in Mon treal, he spurned more lessons from Chapman, saying, “I'll do better without coaching.” And he did. Dressed in a fur coat, and wearing white matching crocheted mitts, muffler and Dutch boy cap—with a red carnation tucked behind the brim—Trudeau marched onto the field and booted the ball 28 yards. Three weeks earlier Trudeau had spent a quiet weekend in New York, in one engagement with U Thant—he had simply picked up the phone in Ottawa to call the U. N. Secretary General directly, much to the horror of his protocol officers —and two dates with Barbra Streisand. The Prime Minister had met the singing star in London at a reception follow ing the European film pre miere of “Funny Girl.” Now he dined and danced with her and escorted her to the thea ter. When a gossip columnist asked him whether it was seri ous, Trudeau grinned and said to an aide, “Arrest that man.” It was a neat and relaxed play on his London effort to intimi date the press, and it designat ed a noticeable trend toward self‐control in public. Trudeau's frequent compan ion is a 25‐year‐old Montreal actress, Louise Marleau, who not long ago became the sub ject of a question in the House of Commons. Donald Maclnnis, a Conservative, wanted to know if the Government in tended, through a federal film‐development agency, to finance a movie starring Miss Marleau. There was a hush in the chamber while members waited for Trudeau to explode. Instead, he placed one finger against his temple in the tra ditional sign indicating he thought MacInnis was crazy. Even the image of a swinger has become somewhat sub dued. Undoubtedly Trudeau likes the company of a woman young enough to be his daugh ter, and it may be that he enjoys the sensation this cre ates. But there is also more public awareness that Trudeau can be shy and distant. A disk jockey in Toronto quipped, “Say, did you hear the Prime Minister was out with Barbra Streisand? I'll bet he spent all evening saying, ‘I run Cana da.’” Crowds no longer greet him as effusively as they once did. But this in itself may not be so surprising; an American resident in Ottawa points out that Adlai Stevenson lost some of his allure in the 1956 Presidential campaign com pared with 1952, partly be cause of the inevitable repeti tion of many things said before. Trudeau today can sound stale when he talks of national unity or the need for a bill of rights. The Gallup poll reveals a slackening of attrac tion among the group aged 21 to 29, but the charisma is far from dead. Recently Trudeau, leaving his seat in the front bench of the House of Com mons, glanced up and noticed a cluster of young people in the visitors' gallery. He waved. They let out a cheer and waved back. But it can work in reverse. Two types of heckling some times confront Trudeau. In one—if it is verbal or imper sonal—he responds easily and well and with quips. But in the other—if it involves either physical abuse or invasion of privacy—he reacts quite dif ferently, and even violently. Last August, on a visit to British Columbia, he did not like being jeered at by young demonstrators who held aloft placards, “Hustle grain, not women.” But he retained con trol of himself until, in Van couver, a group of Vietnam protesters jostled him and swore at him for not being critical enough of U.S. policy. The eyewitness accounts be came confused, but it appeared that one demonstrator took a swing at Trudeau, who retali ated by seizing the youth's hat and squashing it down on his forehead. Among teen‐agers, however, Trudeaumania is still endemic. Cartoonist Jim Reidford in Toronto's Globe and Mail de picted Trudeau's birthday in a sketch showing two teen‐age girls discussing their idol. One says: “So he's not 48. So he's 50. But that doesn't mean he's 50 like your FATHER.” Quite representative of his unorthodox ways of behaving and reacting was the meeting in Ottawa last month with Beatle John Lennon and his wife, Yoko. Trudeau had planned to allow them 10 min utes; he was interested in Len non's idealistic approach to world peace, even while con sidering it impractical. The session stretched into 50 min utes when Trudeau found him self fascinated by Lennon's personality and effort to change an image from a pop ideal into a serious figure: there was something of a par allel with his own case. One or two commentators condemned Trudeau for grant ing so much time when, for instance, the Mennonites had long been attempting unsuc cessfully to make an appoint ment on a similar mission of peace. Some of the dinosaurs in the Civil Service even won dered if it was proper for a Prime Minister to associate with a Beatle. But, as Trudeau himself remarked, informally, he was worried whether it would be bad for Lennon's image to call on a Prime Min ister. Lennon, incidentally, found Trudeau a “beautiful” person and told reporters, “You don't know how lucky are in Canada.” The magnetism is not con fined to youth. At a social gathering in Montreal a few weeks ago, attended by some of the most elegant and wealthy members of English and French society, word spread that Trudeau would be dropping by around midnight. Most of the guests anticipated his arrival with the tremor of youngsters, and greeted him with an awed silence. “Hey, it's quiet in here,” he declared, and immediately was sur rounded by adult men and women—and small talk. Tru deau does not really enjoy such gatherings. He much pre fers the intimate intellectual discussions he participated in as a professor or Justice Min ister. Now he manages occa sionally to conduct such ses sions at his Prime Minister's residence in Ottawa. When Trudeau first contem plated the move to the man sion, with its 30‐foot drawing room and assorted living rooms, he exclaimed, “A great place for parties.” But in fact he has held no frivolous par ties there. Instead, most of the men and women who arrive at 24 Sussex Drive are scientists, philosophers, historians, econ omists, academics. And they arrive in small groups, not to be seated at the 24‐place for mal dining‐room table but at the table for six in the half circular bay window. Trudeau questions his guests intensely and works them; his dinner parties waste little time with small talk. DESPITE his striving for privacy, despite his open re sentment that the press and public sometimes intrude on his personal life, Trudeau likes being Prime Minister of Canada. As one of his old est confidantes expressed it, “Trudeau never thought he would enjoy making things run. Certainly, he was not the type of man who would chase after a political career. But once it was offered to him, one should not be",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

surprised it turned out this way.” When he first took office, a prevalent question was whether he would allow him self to stay on, or whether, with his hauteur and penchant for independence, he would walk out on whim or in dis gust. Now it is rather more the traditional question of whether the public will want him to continue as Prime Min ister when a general election is called, within the next three years. Despite the drop in his following, he still holds an overwhelming lead in popu larity over other contenders. In any event, the public's re sponse to him appears to be contained in the kind of mash note from teen‐agers received almost automatically in every newspaper office whenever Pierre Elliott Trudeau is en meshed in controversy: “We still love our Prime Minister," P.E.T.”■""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Constitutional Question: Is There a Right to Abortion?,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/01/25/archives/constitutional-question-is-there-a-right-to-abortion-is-there-a.html,"FOR years, reformers have tried to per suade state legislatures to except certain women from the general ban on abortion —those women made pregnant by rape or incest, for example, or those likely to bear severely deformed child.  Except in a few states, the reformers have not gotten very far. Most notably in New York, where an 1828 abortion law is still the model for the laws of 36 other states, they have failed completely. And when the mild Blumenthal reform bill, in a last‐minute de feat of stunning surprise and drama, was re jected by the New York State Legislature last spring, it appeared to many people that the reformers had nowhere else to go. But that was not the case. Even before the bill, sponsored by Assemblyman Albert H. Blumenthal (D., Manhattan) died, small groups of reformers throughout the country had begun to look to a new forum: the courts. As 1969 drew to a close, their efforts had al ready been startlingly effective. By the end of 1970, they may be rewriting history. More important than the change of tactics is the change of philosophy that underlies the new abortion‐reform movement. The reform ers no longer claim that the states, basically correct in regulating abortion, are simply too rigid in the way they apply this power. Now, they are seeking to establish abortion as positive legal right, like the right to free speech or the right to be secure against un lawful search and seizure, protected by the United States Constitution against interference by the state on any but the most press ing grounds. If they succeed, it is just pos sible that there will not be an abortion law left standing in any state by the end of this year. ARIGHT to abortion. Such a notion, at first hearing, sounds fantastic, illusory. The Constitution is searched in vain for any men tion of it. The very phrase rings of the rhetoric of a Women's Liberation meeting. But last September, the Supreme Court of the State of California threw out a state statute essentially identical to New York's abortion law on the ground that allowing abortion only when it is “necessary to preserve the life” of the mother is unconstitutionally vague and violates the fundamental notion of due proc ess of law. Such a statute, Justice Raymond A. Peters wrote in his opinion, is not “suffi ciently certain to satisfy due process require ments without improperly infringing on fun damental constitutional rights.”* His opinion contained another thought: “The rights in volved in the instant case are the woman's rights to life and to choose whether to bear children. . . . The fundamental right of the woman to choose whether to bear children follows from the Supreme Court's and this court's repeated acknowledgment of a ‘right to privacy’ or ‘liberty’ in matters related to marriage, family, and sex.” *Before that decision came down, California had in fact liberalized its law to allow abor tion in cases of rape, incest, or to preserve the mother's physical or mental health. Tech nically, the decision only voids the old law after the fact. Since 1967, nine states have liberalized their abortion laws, all of them ex cept California including probable fetal de formity as a ground for abortion. In view of this slow but discernible trend, it seems ironic to some observers that the new re formers, if successful, would throw out the new laws as well as the old. But to the re formers, the new laws are but a scarce im provement, since they still leave all the power over abortion in the hands of the state. Two months later, United States District Court Judge Gerhard A. Gesell overturned the District of Columbia's more liberal statute, which permitted abortion to preserve the mother's life or health, on essentially the same grounds. Judge Gesell wrote: “There has been, moreover, an increasing indication in decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States that as a secular matter woman's liberty and right of privacy extends to family, marriage and sex matters and may well include the right to remove an unwanted child at least in early stages of pregnancy. Matters have certainly reached a point where a sound, informed interest of the state must affirmatively appear before the state infringes unduly on such rights.” Those two decisions, People v. Belous in California and United States v. Vuitch in Washington, D. C., are expected to be prel udes to what could be the most important decision of all. In New York on April 15, a three‐judge Federal court will hear four com bined test cases that challenge the constitu tionality of New York's abortion law on a variety of grounds—some old and some very new. The four suits, which technically are being brought against State Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz and New York City's district A 39‐day‐old human embryo, about half an inch long. attorneys, asks for a permanent injunction against the enforcement of New York's abor tion law. Should the injunction be granted, the state will appeal the decision to the United States Supreme Court, which auto matically hears an appeal from a three‐judge Federal court. But, because of scheduling problems, that will almost certainly not be until late next fall. “And by then,” says Roy Lucas, “New York will be a different place.” IF Roy Lucas's optimism seems premature, that is not surprising. At the age of 28, he could properly be called the father of the new abortion‐reform movement, and he is getting used to success. He seems at first glance an unlikely choice for such a role. The son of a Baptist deacon from Columbia, S. C., Lucas is a rather reserved young man who speaks quietly with a mild Southern drawl. In 1967, his last year at New York Univer sity Law School, he had to choose a topic for a senior project. He had been interested in abortion reform, and decided that trying to prove that abortion laws were unconstitu tional would be a good legal challenge. To set out to prove that abortion was right that the state could not abridge was surprising, to, say the least; it had never been done. “People thought it was a weird idea,” Lucas recalls. “My professors kind of laughed at me, but I went ahead and spent six months at it. Then I figured that was the end of it.” But that was not the end of it. In June, 1968, his paper, now called “Federal Constitu tional Limitations on the Enforcement and Administration of State Abortion Statutes,” was published in the North Carolina Law Re view and, from there, reprinted and widely distributed by the. Association for the Study of Abortion, Inc., a research organization based in New York. More than a year later, the California Supreme Court was to cite the paper in the Belous decision. The Association for the Study of Abortion gave Lucas a grant to prepare a model trial brief that could be used to test the abortion laws of any state, based on the New York model—abortion only to preserve the mother's life. The brief was a 104‐page docu ment. But the core of the new approach was still the statement Lucas had made in his senior paper: “Although interests at stake in the abortion controversy are diverse, subtle, novel, and sensitive, the case appears ulti mately to fit within the classical framework of governmental interference with important interests of individual liberty and to be ca pable of resolution in traditional constitutional terms.” THE four cases are all different. Each was developed separately by its own lawyers, al though the lawyers were all aware of the others' work and agreed to file their suits at approximately the same time last October. “It was almost a case of simultaneous scien tific discovery,” says Nancy Stearns, one of five women lawyers who are representing several hundred plaintiffs—married pregnant women, unmarried pregnant women, non pregnant women, social workers and psychol ogists, physicians and nurses—in a classaction suit which is the largest of the four cases. The single plaintiff in another of the cases is the Rev. Jesse Lyons, pastoral minister of the Riverside Church in New York and founder of the Clergymen's Consultation Serv ice on Abortion, who claims that the abortion law interferes with his right to refer his pas toral counselees to qualified physicians. A third suit is being brought by Communi ty Action for Legal Services, Inc., the Federal ly funded legal‐aid office that serves New York City, on behalf of a couple afflicted with severe cerebral palsy, a pregnant woman and two women with unwanted children. All these plaintiffs claim that the burden of the abor tion laws falls most heavily on the poor, in violation of the right to equal protection of the law. The remaining case is Roy Lucas's suit, co sponsored by the Association for the Study of Abortion. The plaintiffs are four physicians, including Dr. Alan F. Guttmacher, president of Planned Parenthood, who claim that the abortion law deprives them and their patients of constitutional rights. Lucas's brief is based on his model test‐case brief, already a year and a half old. Lucas's constitutional arguments are cen tral to the other three cases as well as to his own, although each case emphasizes different points. All the lawyers do implicitly agree on one point, although it is not spelled out in any of the cases: that the unquestioned right of abortion applies to the earliest stages of preg nancy. Lucas admits to uneasiness about the spectre of aborting, by Caesarian section, late‐term, nearly complete fetuses. Several of the states with liberalized laws require that abortions which are not necessary to preserve the mother's life be performed before a cer tain time, usually between 16 and 26 weeks of pregnancy. Lucas, however, claims that the question is nearly moot: almost any woman, if abortion were readily available, would end an unwanted pregnancy as soon as she learned of it. At 11 weeks the fetus is only two inches long, and nearly every abortion would take place considerably before that. What follows is a summary of Lucas's prin cipal arguments: The New York State penal code—as well as the penal codes in 36 other states—defines “justifiable abortional act” as one “committed upon a female by a duly licensed physician acting under a reasonable belief that such is necessary to preserve the life of such female.” Any other abortion is a felony, with the seriousness of the offense depending on whether the operation was performed before or during the final trimester of pregnancy. The phrase “necessary to preserve the life” is scarcely self‐explanatory, and the law con tains no procedures for determining necessity. “Does it mean that without an abortion a woman has to die immediately, or that she will have her life span shortened by two days?” Lucas asks. A basic common‐law re quirement for due process of law, the essen tial guarantee of the 14th Amendment, is spec ificity, so that a citizen can know precisely what is or is not within the law. The argu ment claims that the law is thus unconstitutionally vague, especially since a physician is in jeopardy of criminal prosecution if his in terpretation of the statute does not agree with that of law‐enforcement authorities. This “void for vagueness” doctrine has been es tablished in several Supreme Court cases. Second, the argument claims, the law vio lates the right to privacy of physicians and their patients in the doctor‐patient relation ship. There is, of course, nothing in the Con stitution referring to doctors and patients. But the argument places this right within the broad areas of personal freedoms guar anteed by the Bill of Rights. The New York Education Law provides that a physician's license can be revoked if he “did undertake or engage in any manner or by any ways or means whatsoever to perform any criminal abortion or to procure the performance of the same by another . . . or did give informa tion as to where or by whom such a criminal abortion might be performed or procured.” The verbal exchange of ideas outlawed here, the argument claims, is protected both by the Constitution itself and by a series of Supreme Court precedents protecting the “freedom to associate and privacy in one's associations.” Third, the argument claims, the law violates a right of marital privacy, especially as it was established by the Supreme Court in Griswold v. Connecticut, the 1965 decision overthrowing Connecticut's law against the use of contraceptives. In that landmark de cision, Associate Justice William O. Douglas of the United States Supreme Court, cited numerous precedents which established free dom of association, inquiry, thought, etc., and concluded: “The foregoing cases suggest that specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras, formed by emanations from those guarantees that help give them life and sub stance.” “We deal with a right of privacy older than the Bill of Rights—older than our political parties, older than our school system,” Jus tice Douglas wrote. “Marriage is a coming together for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of being sacred.” Thus, Lucas's argument claims, a right to abortion is only a logical extension of the right to contraception, especially since not all means of contraception are perfect. A woman should not have to forfeit her protected right to plan a family simply because contraception fails or has not been used. Fourth, the argument holds, the laws de prive physicians of their right to practice medicine according to the highest standards of medical practice. All of the plaintiffs in Lucas's case claim that the law interferes with their personal freedom in the conduct of their professional lives. Fifth, the Lucas brief quotes the decision in the Belous case that the law violates “the fundamental right of a woman to choose whether to bear children,” and that the law infringes on her “right to life [which] is in volved because childbirth involves risks of death,” a violation of liberty without due process of law. Sixth, the argument claims that the law violates the standard of equal protection by having widely differing effects on different women. Women with money, knowl edge and an influential pri vate physician, for example, can obtain legal abortions much more easily than can poor women whose only con tact with doctors is at clinics, where they may never see the same one twice, and whose only knowledge of the law is a negative one that has taught them to avoid the law rather than to exploit it. Seventh, the law violates the First Amendment prohi bition against laws establish ing a religion. This argument refers partly to the role of the Catholic Church in opposing abortion reform, and partly to the broader issue of imposing by law upon a woman a belief about the nature of life that is not necessarily her own. In his senior paper at N.Y.U., Lucas had written: “If a woman believes that life be gan in the ‘prehistoric slime’ and is not created but only passed along by conception and that a fetus in early de velopment need not be ac corded a right to continue growing within her body, she is nonetheless prohibited from acting freely on that belief.” Eighth, the argument claims that laws forcing women to bear each child they conceive violate the Eighth Amend ment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Finally, the argument con cludes that the laws must be voided because the state can claim no “compelling or over riding justification” for abridging these constitution ally protected rights. THE other cases elaborate on particular arguments. Marcia Lowry, who wrote the brief for the Community Action for Legal Services suit, says she had long been fa miliar with Lucas's work and had become convinced that “it is really a poor people's issue.” More than 90 per cent of the legal abortions in New York City hospitals are per formed on white women, while nonwhite women ac count for a large proportion of the deaths from bungled, illegal abortions. “On paper we're all being very moral, but in faot we all know that it is the poor women who have to pay,” says Miss Lowry, a 1969 graduate of New York Uni versity Law School. “They don't have a permanent re lationship with a family doc‐ tor; they can't express them selves well; they can't afford to get certified by psychia trists. There has to be some thing wrong with a law that makes legal abortion so much more available to white women. Even if the law doesn't have that intent, it certainly has that effect.” Miss Lowry's suit claims that this effect is a violation of equal protection under the law. The class ‐ action suit brought by the five women lawyers stresses the women's rights argument, an aspect that Lucas does not empha size, although he is personally sympathetic to it. “It's absurd that women should be turned into little incubators for the human race,” he says in con versation. Nancy Stearns, a staff lawyer with Arthur Kinoy's Law Center for Con stitutional Rights, who did most of the work on the brief, says: “Our job is to convince the judges of something that to me is as plain as day— that every woman has the right to bring this suit, that these laws affect every wo man's sex life whether she is pregnant or not. It can't be more obvious that this is one law that has been incredibly oppressive of women and has seriously hurt many, many women.” Cyril C. Means, Jr., a pro fessor at the New York Law School and the attorney for the Rev. Jesse Lyons, has studied the history of abortion laws perhaps more extensive ly than anyone else in the field. Means, a courtly, 6‐foot tall redhead, describes him self as a “hopeless reaction ary,” whose interest in abor tion reform is purely intellec tual. “In the eighteen‐hun dreds, when this country was underpopulated,” he says, “the luxury of not having unwanted children was un thinkable. But now, the indi vidual motivation and social motivation sanctioning abor tion have at last become parallel. The legitimate state interest is now in preventing overpopulation. But I'm not sentimental. If there were a nuclear holocaust and we had to start over again, I'd bring back all the abortion laws.” Means, who was one of three lawyers appointed in 1968 to Governor Rockefel ler's 11‐member Commission to Review New York State's Abortion Law, has constructed an argument against the law based on one of the oldest common‐law principles: “Ces sante ratione legis cessat et ipsa lex” (Once the reason for a law has ceased to exist, the law itself ceases to exist). Under the common law of England, which was the law of New York for 165 years, abortion in early pregnancy was not a punishable offense, and abortion in late preg nancy was only a misde meanor. The dividing line was the time of “quickening” —when the mother first feels movement in her womb which usually occurs some time during the second tri mester of pregnancy. (This is much earlier than viability— the age at which a fetus could survive outside the womb.) Only at quickening was fetal life considered de veloped enough to deserve the protection of the state. In the eighteen‐twenties, New York's lawmakers de cided to gather the diverse common law provisions into a modern, unified code of law. The commissioners appointed to this task changed the com mon law regarding abortion, and made abortion before quickening a misdemeanor and abortion after quickening a felony, except when neces sary to preserve the life of the mother. Means tried to discover why the revisers had changed the common law, and he thinks he has found the reason in a section of the pro posed revisions that the Leg islature did not adopt: a pro hibition against all surgery, unless necessary to save the patient's life. Based on New York hospi tal records of those days, be fore the era of antiseptic surgery, about 30 per cent of all serious operations, includ ing abortion, resulted in death. During the same period, the death rate from childbirth was about 2 per cent. Means concludes that the revised abortion law was drawn up not out of any legislative concern for the unborn child — in whom the Legislature had never ex pressed an interest—but out of concern for the life of the mother, who had 15 times as great a chance of surviving childbirth as of surviving an abortion. “Under those circum stances,” Means says, “for a legislature to say to a woman, ‘You bloody idiot, no matter how tragic this pregnancy is, we prohibit you from under going this great risk of death,’ was justifiable. Any court in its right mind would say that this was a legitimate exercise of police power.” But today the situation is reversed. In Czechoslovakia and Hungary, useful examples because hospital abortions there are available on demand during the first trimester of pregnancy, the death rate from abortion is 3 per 100,000. In the United States, the ma ternal mortality rate, exclud ing deaths from abortion, is about 23 per 100,000, making abortion statistically almost 8 times safer than a term preg nancy instead of 15 times more dangerous. In all its revisions of the 1828 law, the New York Legislature has never offered a new rationale for the abor tion prohibition to replace the original one that Means claims is no longer relevant. In fact, the law now frustrates what Means sees as the Legisla ture's original purpose by compelling women to choose the more dangerous of the two alternatives. Means does not claim that the state legis lators, in their wisdom, have been wrong about abortion from the beginning. He says that their once‐valid reason ing no longer applies, and that for that reason the law should no longer apply either. THE lawyers for the four cases will not be alone as they argue before United States District Court Judge Edward Weinfeld, United States District Court Judge Harold R. Tyler Jr. and United States Court of Appeals Judge Henry J. Friendly. The State of New York is the defendant, with Assistant Attorney Gen eral Joel Lewittes handling the defense. Lewittes, a 35‐year‐ old Yale Law School grad uate, has based the state's defense of its law on two major grounds: that the issue is one that should be decided by the Legislature rather than by the court, and that the state has an interest in the protection of the unborn child that overrides any other per sonal rights that the laws might otherwise be deemed to threaten. “Our feeling about the abortion law doesn't alter its constitutionality,” Lewittes says. “Our mood changes, but that mood must be reflected in the Legislature. It's a slow and frustrating process, but it is still important to segregate the law and social reform. Is every social‐reform matter to be presented to the courts? What are legislatures for? We've grown‐‐‐thappily—away from strict construction, but that doesn't mean that the legislatures should be brow beaten by the courts.” Lewittes dismisses the vagueness argument. “Any surgeon knows what ‘necessary to preserve life’ means. A surgeon makes that de cision every day, no matter what kind of operation he is performing. The abortion law presents him with no new choices.” Lewittes contends that abor tion cannot be covered by extending the Griswold doc trine of a right to marital privacy. In his memorandum opposing the convening of three‐judge court, Lewittes wrote about such an exten sion: “But here [when deal ing with abortion] we are no longer in the sacred precincts of the marital bedroom. The act is complete, the doors are open, and the zone of privacy is no more. A potential hu man being's life has begun and new competing rights are at stake; competing rights which the state has seen fit to recognize?” This basic right of the fetus to state protection, simi lar to that given fully devel oped human beings, also overrides Whatever right the woman may have to control the use of her body. “It is at once naive and dangerous,” Lewittes wrote, “to contend that such an absolute right [abortion on demand] flows from the ‘sovereign’ right of females over their own bodies. We are not concerned here with an appendix or tonsils or vaccination or blood transfusions but with an en tity apart from the person of the mother.” The arguments that abor tion was not a crime in com mon law or that the legisla ture enacted the original statute for a reason which is no longer valid are, Lewittes claims, essentially irrelevant. “History is interesting,” he says, “but harkening back to the common law can be disas trous. We know more now. There is a science of fetology. A doctor, when he is treating a pregnant woman, knows he is treating two patients.” And so, after all the con stitutional arguments have been heard, the abortion issue comes back to what it has really always been—a ques tion of how one views the fetus. If the unquickened fetus is, as Roy Lucas con tends, “just a mass of proto plasm,” then the legal ques tions raised by abortion are no more difficult than any in other problems of law. But if, as others argue, a fetus at whatever stage of development is a potential human being with the same right to life as any other human being, the other rights claimed in the abortion issue must of necessity take second place, even if their existence is conceded in the abstract. SUCH an argument is raised by Thomas Ford, a lawyer who, with eight Catholic doctors, was given permission to enter the case as an intervenor on the side of the state. As full party to the case, Ford and his group will have the same right of appeal as the original defendants and plaintiffs. “This is a much bigger ball game than the argument about abortion alone,” says Ford, the father of seven children and a member of the Science Committee at Mercy Hospital in Rockville Centre, L.I. “It's certainly not only a Catholic issue, and to make it one is to distort it. We're dealing with the definition of life itself. Abortion is a very dangerous thing, and I'm afraid of it. It is a prelude to trading lives. Once you start to lower the value of life in any form, you lower the value of life in all forms. If you want to relieve the population explosion, then doesn't euthanasia come next? Logically, the elderly, the senile, the helpless people with no potential for quality of life are much more likely candidates than a potential life with all it promise.” “When these people talk about a right to life,” Cyril Means says, “they are ignor ing the fact that the zygote is merely the reorganization of the elements of the sperma tozoon and the ovum, both of which are certainly alive. Neither dies at fusion. The life of the constituent ele ments continues on. It is no more and no less a life than it was before. If I took two bottles of Chateauneuf‐du Pape and poured them into a pitcher, would it be logical to say that my Chateauneuf‐du Pape has just begun in the pitcher? “When does life begin?” Means continued. “The an swer is that it doesn't. Life began. There was one abio genesis when something hap pened to turn inanimate mat ter into animate cells. And it happened only once. There are no abiogeneses occurring today. Human life is con tinuous. Human persons are discontinuous and individual. It is not human life that is sacred. It is the human person, and the early fetus is not a human person.” Thomas Ford does not ac cept this view. “It is falla cious; the sperm will never develop into a human being if it lives a million years. We only come into being at that joinder, and it was self‐evi dent to the founding fathers that each one of us is unique. Man is a trilogy. We are all in dividuals; we are all part of the continuum of life; and we all possess, I believe, a spark of the divine.” The law, from common law to recent court cases, does not support the view that the unquickened, nonviable fetus has the rights of a developed human being. Neither does current medical practice. If a premature delivery occurs of a fetus less than 20 weeks old, it is regarded as a spon taneous abortion, not a birth, and is not listed on the moth er's parity record. Without any red tape, the plaintiffs contend, nearly every abortion would take place in earliest pregnancy. Doctors anywhere perform a late abortion, which is a serious operation, only for pressing medical reasons. But it is not an issue on which anyone has yet had the last word and, if the three‐ judge court wishes to decide the current cases on the broadest possible grounds, then the question of the rights of the fetus as weighed against the rights of the adults is bound to be central. If the court strikes down the New York law merely on the grounds of unconstitu tional vagueness, then the state may—and Joel Lewittes is convinced that it would— enact a statute with more precise terminology. “To pre vent the state from making a new law, the court has to say nothing less than that the fetus is not an entity that the state has a legitimate inter est in protecting,” Lewittes says. Many observers feel that that is exactly what is likely to happen. Assemblyman Blumen thal now favors total repeal of abortion laws and hopes that a decision on the current cases will have that effect. “It may be the only answer,” he said recently. “And I'd gladly accept it. Repeal is the cor rect route now, and if the courts could solve the prob lem it would be both prefer able and faster.” The only certainty is that the cases will not be over at the end of the scheduled one day of oral argument. The judges will probably take sev eral months to announce their decision—the Supreme Court of California took more than six months in the Belous case —and then the cases will un doubtedly go to the Supreme Court on appeal from the los ing side. There, of course, any decision on the New York law will have an equal and immediate effect on the 36 other similar state laws. “This is one of the most in teresting cases of my time,” Thomas Ford said. On that, defendants, plaintiffs and probably the judges them selves will agree. A forthcoming court challenge could bring the striking down of all anti‐abortion laws in the U. S.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Opponents of the Abortion Law Gather Strength in Legislature,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/01/26/archives/opponents-of-the-abortion-law-gather-strength-in-legislature-but.html,"ALBANY, Jan 25—For the fourth consecutive year, the question of reform or outright repeal of the state's abortion law will come before the legis lature—this time amidst a mood of uncertainty over whether to act on the contro versial issue or to leave its resolution to the courts. Interviews with legislators involved in seeking change or repeal of the abortion law in dicated two things today. First, there is a much stronger senti ment among the lawmakers, although it is by no means a majority, for abolishing the abortion statute. The law, passed in 1828, permits the termination of a pregnancy only when the mother's life is in jeopardy. Secondly, several of these legislators said they sensed an indisposition on the part of other legislators to become em broiled in the issue this year because, as one legislative com mittee report put it: “It may well be that the matter of abor tion law reform has now been reduced to the academic ques tion of whether the courts or the Legislature act first.” The report by the Joint Legis lative Committee on Public Health, which is headed by Senator Norman F. Lent. Repub lican of Nassau, referred to two recent court decisions striking down the abortion laws of California and the District of Columbia. Challenge Due In addition, a special three‐ judge Federal court is expected to hear arguments on April 15 brought by four separate litigants that challenge the con stitutionality of New York's law. The decision of such a spe cial court can be appealed di rectly to the United States Supreme Court. This week, Assemblyman Al bert H. Blumenthal, a Manhat tan Democrat who has long been in the vanguard of abor tion law reform, will reintro duce his bill to liberalize the existing abortion law. The Blumenthal bill would broaden the existing law and permit abortions in the follow ing cases: ¶When there was risk of the baby's being born physically or, mentally defective. ¶When there is risk the pregnancy, would gravely im pair the physical or mental health of the mother. ¶When the pregnancy re sulted from rape or incest. 41When the pregnancy oc curred while the mother was unmarried and 15 years old or younger. This bill, seemingly assured of Assembly passage last year, was scuttled in last minute debate primarily because of highly emotional and personal speech by Assemblyman Martin Ginsberg, a Nassau Republican. Mr. Blumenthal is also one of the sponsors of the more sweeping bill introduced in the Assembly by Assemblywoman Constance E. Cook, an Ithaca Republican, and by Assembly man Franz S. Leichter, a Demo crat of Manhattan. That bill, which would repeal the abortion‐control law outright, was first introduced last year with only Mrs. Cook and Mr. Leichter sponsoring it. It was not even introduced in the Senate. However, Mr. Leichter said today that Senator Basil A. Paterson, a Harlem Democrat, had introduced the measure in the Senate and that there were now at least 36 additional sponsors, both Senators and Assemblymen. “Others have said they'll go along with it,” Mr. Leichter said. One of the sponsors of re peal this year is Assemblyman Ginsberg, whose change of mind is due at least in part to the desires of his constitu ents. Bond Issue Urged In another development to day, Senator Samuel L. Green berg, Democrat of Brooklyn, called for a new $2.2‐billion bond issue to finance pollution abatement projects. In a report critical of the handling of the state's long‐range $1‐billion pure water program, Senator Greenberg said the Rockefeller administration had been “lag gard” and “irresolute.” The pro gram began in 1965. The Republican ‐ controlled Legislature will act on Gover nor Rockefeller's $93.7‐million deficiency budget this week. The budget is to meet unantici pated program costs incurred in the $6.4‐billion budget for the 1969–70 fiscal year ending March 31. In the Assembly, the minority leader, Stanley Steingut, Demo crat of Brooklyn, said that he had begun a survey of school districts to determine the im pact of Governor Rockefeller's proposed $1.3‐billion budget for the 1970–71 fiscal year on “the quality of education and on school property taxes.” Referring to the Governor's proposal to increase education spending by $360‐million for the coming school year, which the Democrats feel is an inade quate increase, Mr. Steingut said: “I can safely predict that the homeowners . . . will be faced with property tax in creases from which they will recoil with horror.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Ads for London Abortions Stir Legal Questions,",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/01/26/archives/ads-for-london-abortions-stir-legal-questions.html,"BOSTON, Jan. 25—The Mas sachusetts Supreme Court will be asked to rule on the legality of advertising that offers, for $1,250, to make all arrange ments for an abortion in Eng land. State Attorney General Rob ert H. Quinn said yesterday he would ask for a ruling on the advertising by the London Agency, Inc., of Springfield, Mass., reportedly the first com pany of its kind in New Eng land. The package deal offered in the advertising includes air transportation, passports, health certificates and hotel accom modations—as well as an abor tion in a private London hospi tal—to women recommended by American physicians. Joseph O. Stothert, treasurer, I clerk and director of the com pany, said it was established after months of negotiations with London officials, research and recommendations by Con necticut and Massachusetts medical authorities and clergy men. Abortions are “completely lend totally legal” in England, he said, and there is “nothing illegal in our operation—we are just performing a social Service. One woman has already been sent to London for an abortion, according to Mr, Stothert, who is also a lawyer of Long meadow a Springfield suburb. District Attorney Matthew J. Ryan of Hampden County (Springfield) is assisting in an investigation of the company. “We are still checking the agency's articles of incorpora tion to determine if there is any violation of the laws of Massachusetts,” Mr. Ryan said. The incorporation papers filed with the Massachusetts Secretary of State describe the agency as a travel service bush ness. Mr. Stothert said his organization had been “metic ulously precise” in setting up the corporation to avoid legal entanglements. Mr. Stothert said that only women who had been ex amined by competent Ameri can physicians offering satis factory evidence that an abor tion was necessary, and who were physically and mentally able to accept the operation, were eligible. After talks with medical and church officials in Connecticut and Massachusetts, he said, it had been determined that “there is a great social need for change in the present abor tion laws.” “All of these people are well aware of the horrible situa tion resulting from criminal abortions,” he said. “The laws dealing with abortions are anti quated. I have no doubt that the laws will be changed with in the next few years, but what will happen in the meantime?” Mr. Stothert said that with the red tape involved in apply ing for legal abortions, the time factor was important. Medical authorities, he said; recommend that no abortion be performed where the pregnancy is more than 14 weeks advanced. There is a danger to the patient when the pregnancy is more than 10 I weeks old, he said. Private hospitals in London are used, Mr. Stothert said, be cause public facilities there are overcrowded and no waiting period is necessary in a private hospital. “The legal aspects of the entire operation have been cleared,” he said. We are act ing only as a kind of travel agency which expedites trips and makes the passenger as comfortable as possible.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Books of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/01/26/archives/books-of-the-times-the-monotonous-music-of-the-spheres.html,"TO extend the metaphor: Mr. Bellow's planet is layered over with a thick vegetation of elegant prose, in places lush, elsewhere tended and orderly, every where a thing to behold by itself. Beneath it is the crust of a plot—a seemingly absurd tale involving a Negro pickpocket who ex poses himself in an Upper West Side lobby, a pilfered scientific manuscript, a New Rochelle attic flooded in a search for hidden money, a fatal brain hem orrhage, the back seat bar of a silver Rolls‐Royce, fell latio in Mexico, philosophy in Westchester County. Beneath the crust is an as sortment of char acters, Bellowian urban types, äng stlich and articu late: a neurotic operator descend ed from Tommy Wilhelm of “Seize the Day, a rutting female left over, perhaps, from Maurice Herzog's fantasies, a dying gynecologist, mad, toeless Israeli artist. And at the core, there to hold this fictional world together with his gravity, is Artur Sammler himself, 70‐plus, tall, small‐headed, one‐eyed Jew ish journalist from Cracow by way of Bloomsbury and the holocaust—a Herzog gone exquisitely sane, and playing Prospero to his former role as mad King Lear. A Problem of Gravity Yet one keeps floating off “Mr. Sam mler's Planet” and drifting away from Mr. Bellow's. They turn too slowly. Or their surfaces are too slippery to stand on. Or Mr. Sammler's gravitational pull is insuf ficient. Something is wrong. Everything revolves around Mr. Sammler (his name is German for “collector”). He lives with a widowed niece in an apartment on West 90th Street (“Westward the Hud son came between Sammler and the great Spry industries of New Jersey.”) He is adrift in the decaying city of the sixties. He observes a black pickpocket magisterially plying his trade on West Side buses. The pickpocket follows Sammler home and assaults him by exposing his genitals (“a tube, a snake”). His kooky daughter, Shula, who imagines that Sammler is writing a memoir of his friendship with H. G. Wells, brings him a manuscript, “The Future of the Moon,” which she has stolen from a visiting lecturer at Columbia. Sammler's nephew and generous pro vider, Elya Gruner, lies stricken with an aneurysm in an East Side hospital. Sam mler visits and consoles him. Gruner's chil dren, Angela and Wallace, ask Sammler to intercede for them with Elya. Angela has offended her father by alienating a pros pective husband with perverse sexual prac tices. Wallace wants money to buy an airplane so he can start a business making aerial photographs of country homes and identifying plants on their grounds. Wallace and Angela both believe that Elya has hidden money in his New Rochelle home— money given to him by Mafia friends for performing abortions. Is this all falling into a pattern? No? I'm not distorting it in summary, and I could go on. I could describe an interminable dis cussion between the Oriental author of “The Future of the Moon” and Mr. Sam mler, which takes place in Elya's New Rochelle home (where Shula has apparently hidden the manuscript) and which is in terrupted by a cascade of water from pipes that Wallace had disconnected in his search for the hidden cash‐cache. I could describe even more farfetched developments. But I won't, because the kinkiness of the plot can only be rationalized as a literary hallucination, as the noumenon of Sammler's vast mind. The real issue is, not cash or culture or space exploration, but the future of the planet. Artur Sammler, “confidant of New York eccentrics . . . registrar of madness,” lives in a purgatory, a limbo between death and death. During the war he and his wife were caught by the Nazis. Sammler's eye was knocked blind, his wife shot. Lazarus‐like, he climbed out of a pile of buried corpses and hid for the remainder of the war in a tomb. Now he carries in his mind the best and the worst of Western civilization. Struggle Against Limitations And at every turn he ruminates. And Bellow rummages endlessly through those ruminations. If one could follow their lab yrinthine ways, follow the thread through the membranes, arteries and synapses of the brain of this most intelligent of Jewish intelligentsia—if one could bear with it, one would no doubt arrive at a perspective on the story's absurdity. One would reach the central gravity of “Mr. Sammler's Planet.” But if one arrives, as I did, at the book's conclusion—which seems to suggest that the world depends on small acts of decency—and finds it simply trite and anticlimactic, then one has clearly lost one's way. I hope. Yet it's hard to avoid getting lost. For despite Mr. Bellow's wonderfully civilized intelligence, there is no growth or dis covery in Mr. Sammler's mind, and he slowly flattens out into a long‐winded bore. As a fatal consequence, Mr. Bellow's planet grows unstable. As it hums along, it grad ually flies apart. First, the language comes unstuck, peels away, and slips off like so much decoration. Then the plot breaks up into a series of unfunny but odd coinci dences. Then the characters hurtle off into pointless eccentricity. And we are left at last with Sammler, turning and turning, droning on monotonously like a toy top. MR. SAMMLER'S PLANET. By Saul Bellow 313 pages.

Women Testify in Abortion Law Test,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/01/27/archives/women-testify-in-abortion-law-test.html,"A 34‐year‐old writer told a Federal court hearing yester day that she had three abor tions between 1960 and 1967 because having an illegitimate child “would have been the end of my life.”  Adoption “would be a cruel and inhuman thing to do with a child,” Susan Brownmiller, a magazine writer, testified. The witness appeared in sup port of one of four Federal court suits that are challenging the constitutionality of the state abortion law. The plaintiff's lawyers rep resent a class‐action suit brought by more than 100 peo ple, mostly women, who have had some experience, either professional or personal, with abortions. 3‐Judge Hearing Due The suit argues that the abortion law deprives women of their fundamental right to private decisions and violates freedom of speech and freedom from religious coercion. The lawyers, Nancy Stearns and Florence R. Kennedy, in tend to present evidence of the emotional impact of illegal abortion on women's lives, in cluding the inability to acquire information about it. Testimony at these hearings is part of a deposition that will be turned over to the three‐ judge Federal Court that will hear the four combined suits beginning April 15. Miss Brownmiller, a thin bru nette, described to the hearing how, after undergoing a “quick abortion” in Cuba in 1960, she encountered obstacles when she wished the same procedure in New York in 1963. Unable to get help from her own gynecologist, Miss Brown miller learned “through the grapevine” of a Baltimore phy sician who might help her. Speaking nervously in short sentences, the witness related how she met the Baltimore doc tor in his office at 11 P.M., gave him $350, signed a blank piece of paper and agreed to return the next day. The witness said she left Baltimore two days later with her money and without an abor tion because the doctor did not think her “right” for his then experimental method. Miss Brownmiller said she finally obtained an abortion in Puerto Rico from a doctor who asked for $700 but finally ac cepted $300 because she was insistent. She described a second $300 abortion in Puerto Rico as “routine.” A 24‐year old unmarried edi torial assistant testified earlier that she was turned down last year by four of five referred doctors in Boston before ob taining a successful abortion in Japan. “Everything went very very smoothly,” the young woman testified of her experience in Japan. “I didn't feel like a crim inal. Everybody treated me like a human being.” Also present at the hearing were Assistant Attorney Gen eral Joel Lewittes, representing the state, and Thomas Ford, at torney for eight Roman Catho lic doctors intervening on the side of the state. The two major points on which the state's defense is based are that the issue should be decided in the Legislature instead of the court and that the state has an interest in the rights of an unborn child.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Abortion Hearing Gets View of 8 Catholic Doctors,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/01/28/archives/abortion-hearing-gets-view-of-8-catholic-doctors.html,"The director of gynecology and obstetrics at Georgetown University Hospital told a Fed eral Court hearing yesterday that an abortion, other than to save a mother's life, was “poor biology” and “poor science.” The witness, Dr. Andre Hel ligers, testified in the final week of deposition hearings that are part of a civil case challenging the constitutional ity of the New York State abortion law. The case is to be heard by a three‐judge Federal Court on April 15. The doctor appeared on be half of eight Roman Catholic physicians who are intervening on the side of the state in the case. He told the hearing that he considered the life of a fetus to be as important as that of the mother. In obstetrics, he said, “it's almost universal” to consider the fetus separate in treatment. “I don't think of abortion as a method of birth control,” Dr. Helligers said. “A physician might call it that, but scien tifically it is nonsense.” Dr. Helligers said he would advise abortion if “the pres ence of the fetus was a threat to the survival of the moth er.” The doctor suggested sev eral possibilities in which this might be the case, including “cancer of the uterus” and “certain forms of congenital heart disease.” Dr. Helligers said his condi tion for abortion could be in terpreted as a time when the “presence of the life of one human being materially agres ses against the life of another human being.” Under cross‐examination he admitted his condition might apply if a mother threatened suicide becuase of an unwanted pregnancy. “If I were convinced the patient would commit suicide, then the presence of the fetus would be materially affecting the mother's life,” he said. Dr. Helligers later qualified his answer by saying he did not believe a psychiatrist could counsel a woman with cer tainty as to whether she should have an abortion. The reason, he said, is that it has been difficult to make follow‐up studies of such women. “People are aborted on psychiatric grounds and never come back again,” he said. Dr. Helligers also discounted rape as a reason for abortion. “Rape is never a problem in this whole business,” he said. “Prior to implantation [before the egg is implanted in the womb], one administers im mediately 50 milligrams of Stil bestrol, the result of which no implantation will take place.” Then if the physician scrapes the lining of the womb as a further precaution to preclude implantation, it will be “diffi cult for the D.A. to prove abortion.” As for the mother contract ing rubella, commonly known as German measles, Dr. Hel ligers said he would prefer the system in Holland where the Government assumes full fi nancial security for “any con genitally deformed infant.” Also testifying yesterday were Dr. George J. Lawrence Jr., driector of obstetrics and gynecology at Flushing Hospi tal and Medical Center and Dr. Natalie Shainess, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst. Dr. Lawrence, a Catholic, said he was against abortion on religious and medical grounds. Dr. Shainess, a plaintiff's wit ness, described cases in which women have been emotionally upset because of problems in obtaining an abortion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DEMOCRATS LOSE ON 2 FARE ISSUES,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/01/29/archives/democrats-lose-on-2-fare-issues-fail-to-halt-lirr-rise-and-60c.html,"ALBANY, Jan. 28—Republi cans in both houses of the Leg islature defeated today a Dem ocratic attempt to eliminate double fares on the city's tran sit system and to head off a fare increase on the Long Is land Rail Road.  The effort, denounced by Re publican leaders as a “political ploy,” came in the form of proposed amendment to the Governor's deficiency budget. For the Democrats, the de bate constituted an exercise in futility because later in the day, in New York City, it was announced that the fare in creases requested by the Long Island would go into effect Saturday. The amendment debated here would have advanced $66‐mil lion to the Metropolitan Trans portation Authority, the state agency that operates both the city transit system and the L.I.R.R. Democrats argued that the loan‐could ulimately be repaid out of Triborough Bridgeand Tunnel Authority surpluses— the authority is a subsidiary of the M.T.A.—and station main tenance costs owed the Long Island by Nassau County and New York City. The Democrats contended that the advance, coupled with other M.T.A. revenues, would have enabled the agency to give some relief to the 460,000 New Yorkers who pay double fares,—those who live on the Rockaways Peninsula and those who must take two buses or a bus and a subway to get to work—and at the same time eliminate the need for the Long Island passenger fare increase of $4.60 a month. The vote in both houses split pretty much along party lines. The amendment went down by 33 to 20 in the Senate, with three Democrats voting no. In the Assembly the tally was 78 to 64, with one Democrat vot ing no. The $77.3‐million deficiency budget, which covers unantici pated costs in this year's main budget, was subsequently ap proved by a vote of 50 to 5 in the Senate and 126 to 16 in the Assembly. The deficiency appropriation —not counting $5.3‐million in advances—is about $10.4‐mil lion less than was requested by Governor Rockefeller. The bulk of the reduction came out of funds originally earmarked for construction of a liberal arts building for the State University at Stony Brook, L.I. Senator Warren M. Ander son, a Binghamton Republican and chairman of the Finance Committee, said work on the building was behind schedule and the money for it would he appropriated in the main budget for the coming fiscal year. Delay Is Urged The deficiency budget con tains an additional appropria tion of $6‐million for the con troversial state office building in Harlem. The money was put in the budget to cover increased costs incurred during the eight months when work on the building was suspended be cause of picketing by Harlem residents who protested that the project had been started without consulting the commu nity. Senator Basil A. Paterson, a Central Harlem Democrat, pro posed an amendment today that would have deleted the state office building appropria tion from the deficiency budget. He argued that the Urban Development Corporation was trying to find some way to in corporate a day‐care center and other community facilities in the site and said that work on the building ought to be delayed until the state agency developed an “acceptable plan.” Senator Anderson, who car ried the rebuttal for the Re publicans, contended that fur ther delays on the building would increase costs at the rate of about $400,000 a month. The cost of the building was originally put at $20‐million, an estimate that has since been revised to $30‐million. The Paterson amendment was de feated by a voice vote. In other developments today: ¶A bipartisan group of 16 legislators introduced in both houses a bill to create with state money a “parent‐student assistance fund” that would make tuition grants on a sliding scale basis, depending on in come, directly to parents of children attending private ele mentary and secondary schools. The grants for each elementary school child would range from $50 to $150 a year. The spon sors estimated the whole pro gram would cost $20‐million in the 1970–71 school year. ¶Assemblyman Albert H. Blumenthal, a Manhattan Demo crat‐Liberal, introduced two abortion bills — one that would amend the State Constitution to make abortion a matter of right; another, following much the same guidelines as a simi lar measure defeated last year, that would liberalize the law to permit the abortion of preg nancies resulting from incest or rape. Mr. Blumenthal said he was supporting a pending bill that calls for total repeal of the abortion law, but want ed to he able to pursue a dif ferent tack if that measure failed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What a complicated machine an Old School European is,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/02/01/archives/what-a-complicated-machine-an-old-school-european-is-mr-sammlers.html,"At 70 plus, Artur Sammler is old enough to be metaphysical. Beyond desire, beyond competition, with nothing further to gain or prove, he lives in that twilight zone of the human condition where philosophy, poetry and parody shade into each other. Rescued by his nephew, Dr. Gruner, from a D.P. camp in Salzburg and supported by him, Sammler makes a full‐time job of trying to interpret life now in New York City.  He picks his way among its ironies in much the same way as he pursues his daily constitutional through the dog‐fouled and garbage‐cluttered streets of the upper West Side. “Aesthetic consumption of the envi ronment,” he calls it. “Translating heartache into delicate even piercing observation.” An exasperated humanist, Sammler reminds us what a complicated piece of machinery a cultivated Old School European is. One cannot help feeeling a profound nostalgia for his type. It is a wonder that the continent which developed him has not erected a monument somewhere in his honor. In an intimate little square with a cafe and a few trees on one side, they might have put up a simple bronze figure of the sort of man who carried the full spirit of his civiliza tion everywhere with him, He seems so timeless, this Sammler, so classical that beside him most of the other characters in recent American fiction — including Bellow's — appear to flicker and fade like fireflies. Because he is so conspicuously dis interested, everyone tries to use Sammler as a moral referee. He is asked to sanction selfishness, to help rationalize unattractive lusts, to cer tify lunatic gestures as sane. He is like a tiny island in a tremendous traffic circle of compulsive pursuits. It is the controlling irony of his life that none of the involvements forced upon him is worthy of him. A good man can only be baited by such an environment. Sammler's niece and housekeeper, a thicklegged German romantic, surrounds him with didactic conversation and dying plants. His daughter, Shula, is a scav enger with a shopping bag on each arm. With monomaniacal sincerity, she forages for American culture in the trash baskets of upper Broadway. Sammler's promiscuous young cousin, Angela, drops in, after visiting her analyst around the corner, to try to revise the unflattering picture the doctor has painted. Sammler, who has seen his wire stripped and shot, must now see Angela stripped and serviced in her explicit accounts of her many affairs. Angela's brother, Wallace, a “high I.Q. moron,” is full of misapplied aptitudes, a caricature of technological futility. He tries to interest Sammler in a get‐rich‐quick scheme based on scientific handicapping of sports. When this fails, he dreams up another “business”: taking aerial photographs of large suburban estates, labeling the trees and shrubs in Latin and offering the end‐product to the owners. Sammler cannot even go to the library without being caught in “a revolution of things colliding.” Coming home in the bus, he sees a crime com mitted and because he is born to bear witness, he is drawn into a fantastic “confrontation” with the criminal, a Negro pickpocket. Coolly, confidently, under Sammler's very nose, the Negro goes through a woman's purse and extracts her money. He is big, powerful, elegantly dressed in a “puma‐colored” coat, and as Sammler watches him, his blood quickens. His excitement is al most sexual,. He is taken back to his own time of daring, a time when he “drank flames” after killing a German soldier at point‐blank range in the Zamosht Forest. But the Negro sees him too. He follows Sammler home and corners him in the deserted lobby, symbolical ly safeguarded by a dead television screen. The old man, and All he repre sents, is put in his place. Without striking him, without even speaking, the pickpocket points out the ab surdity of Sammler's position. Back ing him against the wall, he removes Sammier's dark glasses and then, un buttoning his puma‐colored coat, ex poses himself, Silently, underlining the message with his eyes only, the Negro says, in effect: The contest is unequal. Give it up. Even Sammler's daughter commits a crime. (What could be more natural in New York City than to be sur rounded by crime?) She steals the only copy of an Indian scientist's manuscript: “The Future of the Moon.” Her father has toyed for years with the notion of writing a memoir on H. G, Wells, another moon fancier, and Shula imagines that the Indian's work will stimulate him. What it does is to bring Sammler into an exchange of ideas with Dr. Govinda Lal, and here Bellow in dulges himself in an orgy of meta phors, most of them quite good. They are discussing the future of the earth; it is clearly Mr. Sammler's planet, not the Indian's. Dr. Lal is a sort of science‐fiction Faust, an Erec tor Set romantic. It is necessary to move on to the moon, he says, be cause “not to go where one can go may be stunting.” Furthermore, we need space to “absorb our mistakes.” The earth is saturated with our mistakes. Philosophically speaking, it is all wet. Sammler disagrees. The airless, arid and relatively abstract adventure of the moon does not appeal to him. He expresses a preference for the bottom of the sea, for dense tangibility, a submarine descent into cool, populous finiteness. He desires color and inwardness and distrusts the compulsive centrifugality of the modern synthesis. When Sammler's benefactor, Dr. Gruner, becomes critically ill, Sammler is the only mem ber of his family who is not too egocentric to mourn for him. It appears that the other wise virtuous Gruner once per formed abortions and cached his illegal fees somewhere about his house. As he lies dying in the hospital, his son Wallace is busy flooding the house by ripping out what he conceives to be dummy pipes crammed with hundred‐dollar bills. Gruner's daughter Angela is absorbed by a quarrel with her current lover, who is ret rospectively disgusted by a group scene they improvised while vacationing in Mexico. Like a camera, Gruner's death catches both his children in characteristic attitudes. After first failing with Wallace, Sammler tries to reconcile Angela to her father, who is embittered by her promiscuity. “What do you want,” she asks sarcastically, “a death‐bed scene?” “Just say something to him,” Sammler urges. “Any thing. Try to reach him before it's too late.” When Angela counters with “What is there to say?” Sammler drops his detachment for a moment and allows him self a comment on her life style. “I only note the pecu liarity,” he says, “that it is possible to be gay, amorous, intimate with holiday acquaint ances. Diversions, group inter course, fellatio with strangers —one can do that but not come to terms with one's father at the last opportunity.” Sammler's own daughter is exposed by Gruner's death too. She finds the abortion money and proposes to spend it on clothes. If she could wear fine clothes like Angela, she could give up her eccentricities. Her scavenging, her shopping bags, her fright wig, she confesses, were only an attempt to make herself interesting, a Bohemian substitute for sexual attrac tiveness. Gruner dies unreconciled, and even the omnipotent pick pocket is brought low. He is clubbed almost to death by Sammler's son‐in‐law, who has just emigrated from Israel. Just as Sammler is no match for the Negro, the Negro is no match for history. (The son‐in law's weapon is a bagful of medals commemorating Israel's achievement.) When Sammler intervenes to save the pick pocket, his son‐in‐law says, with the singlemindedness of one who thinks in terms of sheer survival, who is fed up with three thousand years of Talmudic doubt and turning the other cheek: “Either you're in, or you're out. There is no in between.” This is the new Jew. Where Sammler's suffering in World War II has merely added depth and chiaroscuro to his character, has taught him to look at horror without rhetoric, as an ordinary ingredient, a staple, of modern life, his son‐in‐law sees the world in terms of kill‐or‐be killed absolutes. Where Samm ler is a scholar, his son‐in law is a demonstrator. In this book, Bellow has suc ceeded in doing something he never quite managed before— or at least not quite so success fully. He has created a char acter who embodies his ideas, who serves, in fact, as his spckesman, yet remains con vincing in his own right. Samm ler is more than the sum of Bellow's parts. Where Augie March, Henderson and Herzog were brilliant, Sammler is bril liantly human. Where Herzog especially was rather hagridden by his ideas, Sammler carries his with grace. It was a master stroke to make him an old man. An old man is the ideal anti‐hero, with out his usual hang‐ups. His age emancipates him from the stif ling egocentricity of so many characters in contemporary fiction. His needs have nar rowed down to the need to understand. To him, everything is peroration, a summing up, a post‐coital perspective, so to speak. There is something appeal ingly elegiac about Sammler. The book is not only his swan song, but civilization's as we once knew it. With his minutely articulated ideas as his only tools, Sammler is something like a watchmaker tinkering with the huge and faulty mechanism of modern life. And though he may not succeed in putting it back in working order, it is both moving and In structive to see him try.■ Author's Query For a biographical introduc tion of a book on the origin of social conflict, I would appre ciate receiving letters, published or unpublished, personal recol lections, and newspaper or magazine articles on Ludwig Gumplowicz (1838–1909), one of the founders of Sociology, and Gustav Ratzenhofer (1842– 1904), a German military jurist and sociologist.

"Does everybody lie? Yes, says George Washington",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/02/01/archives/does-everybody-lie-yes-says-george-washington-the-life-and-loves-of.html,"“All is jive.” Jive is hypocrisy, lies, put‐ons, false names, phony be liefs and perhaps real beliefs too. Jive is also living, staying alive. Jive is especially living as a black man in white society. Jive is what Cecil Brown's first novel is all about. “I was thinking,” says George Washing ton, his black narrator, near the end of the novel, “that I'd write a novel, a book about the race problem with a dynamite stick concealed inside it. I mean, a real stick of dynamite.” The dynamite is real enough. Washington, a black from the rural South, drifts up to Harlem and be comes, variously, a jazz player, a hustler, an encyclopedia salesman, a self‐styled Princeton graduate. When he has had enough of small‐time jiving, he takes off for Copenhagen to find out if everyone in the world lies as much as he lies in his dedi cated search for invisibility. Copen hagen also becomes a lie for him, at last. He is taken up by the American consul, a fortyish Oklahoma woman, who installs him in the Hilton and visits him at odd hours for fornica tion. The daughter of one of the con sulate's staff members turns on with him at the Hilton. He tries to help a black girl he meets in the lobby who needs an abortion, tries to help her without buying her first, but a fellow black who has married into white Danish money carries her away. Washington's closest friend, Doc, a Harvard black who practices medi cine in Copenhagen, turns out to be a homosexual. Washington is beaten by an African black in a bar. He beats a white lady who maintains a closetful of riding crops. A wealthy Danish girl proposes marriage. And in and around these events, he keeps formulating and reformulating struc tures of identity, changing his name to match each relationship, changing his mind to overcome each tempta tion. “The only way to keep your strength is to give; never accept any thing from anybody.” Yet he does accept things: money front the wo men, friendship from Doc, so that when the relationships begin to col lapse, as they must, being neurotic to begin with, Washington is left with his original question, does ev erybody lie? and the beginnings of an answer, yes. Including and most especially George Washington. “The Life and Loves of Mr. Jiveass Nigger” recalls, in its form and its intense language, other novels, mod els to which Cecil Brown alludes. Its most important sources are Joyce's “A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man” and Ellison's “Invisi ble Man.” In his earlier chapters, a tour up from the South to Harlem, the awareness of black invisibility and its uses (and its self‐destructive ness) Brown creates in a form rem iniscent of Ellison. The pilgrim's prog ress in Copenhagen recalls Joyce— and, like Stephen Dedalus, George Washington is left at last standing at the Atlantic planning his exile. Ironic exile, for Stephen was leaving Ire land, while Washington is returning to the country where he was born. Having realized that he must live from inside himself, where the black ness is. Having realized that exis tential man is a white invention de signed to make white black, while black is already absurd and needs no Camus to explain it. And even as he leaves with his passage paid by the consulate, he toys with suicide and rejects it, be cause whites will use it to explain him; and having decided to become an artist, he knows that he must ex plain himself, must take on that ul timate jiving which is art. Insofar as this novel is autobiographical, that is what Mr. Brown has done: taken on art. All is jive, but he jives very well. ■",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Joseph C.

Cleveland Police Chief Denies Mafia Lawyer's Payoff Charge,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/02/03/archives/cleveland-police-chief-denies-mafia-lawyers-pay-off-charge-attorney.html,"CLEVELAND, Feb. 2—Wil liam P. Ellenburg, Cleveland's police chief for one week, de nied today reports published here and in Detroit over the weekend that he had accepted payoffs to shield a Detroit abor tion operation.  Chief Ellenburg, who was a Detroit police officer for 27 years before retiring as a po lice inspector in 1968, held news conference today to deny charges published Sunday in The Detroit Free Press and The plain Dealer here. The accounts said Lawrence A. Burns, formerly an attorney for Detroit Mafia leaders, ad mitted making payments aver aging $1,000 a month from 1959 to 1963 to Chief Ellenburg and two other Detroit police offi cers. The money was paid, Mr. Burns said in signed statements to The Free Press and the Michigan state police, to pro tect a clinic described as an abortion operation that grossed $250,000 a year from illegal operations. Mr. Burns was identified in the news accounts as formerly the attorney for Anthony (Tony Jack) Giacalone, reputed De troit Mafia boss. Last night Cleveland Mayor Carl B. Stokes, who appointed Chief Ellenburg only last Mon day, went on television on three local stations, to defend his new chief. The Mayor de scribed the charges as “unsub stantiated.” “I am not going to fire him On the basis of a story that, for the moment at least, has no more substantiation” than One man's allegations, “and are more than six years old,” the Mayor said. The Free Press said Mr. Burns talked to one of their reporters in December, shortly after he was indicted by a Fed eral grand jury on charges of failing to file income tax re turns for several years. Mayor Stokes said Chief Ellenburg's background had been checked before the appointment was made, but he said last night a new team of investigators would be sent to Detroit to make additional checks. The Mayor later flew to De troit tonight to take personal charge of the investigation. At today's news conference, held at Central Police Station, Chief Ellenburg said he “cat egorically denied” Mr. Burns's charges. In their story yesterday, the Detroit newspaper said Chief Ellenburg had been offered the opportunity to take a lie detector test and if he had passed it, the stories would not have appeared. Mr. Burns had taken a sim ilar test, the newspaper said, before the stories ran. The chief said he had con sidered taking the test but de clined. “As a police officer it is a questionable thing. The lie de tector is not used in evidence, therefore it is not a true test.” Chief Ellenburg confirmed that he had met Mr. Burns, in the course of his police duties, and also said he would make copies of his income tax re turns for the years in question available to newsmen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Abortion Reform Opportunity,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/02/04/archives/abortion-reform-opportunity.html,"Assemblyman Albert H. Blumenthal of Manhattan has once more introduced a bill at Albany to liberalize this state's cruel abortion law, which permits abortion only when the mother's life is in danger and in no other circumstance.  The Blumenthal bill, defeated by a last‐minute burst of emotion in the 1969 Legislature, would extend the grounds to allow abortion when there is risk of a baby's being born horribly deformed or mentally deficient, when pregnancy resulted from rape or incest, when the mother is unwed and below the age of 16 or when pregnancy threatens to impair gravely the physical or mental health of the mother. This the sort of reform bill that has been approved in recent years in several other states. It is sound, sensible, humane and deserves enactment in New York State. Many abortion‐law reformers now prefer outright repeal to liberalization of the present law. Mr. Blumen thal himself has introduced a constitutional amend ment that amounts to repeal. He has also endorsed the Patterson‐Cook repeal bill, which would remove all restrictions on abortions by duly licensed physi cians. These more sweeping changes would make abortion an issue between a woman and her doctor, without the restrictive interference of the state. Recent court decisions elsewhere in the country have knocked down abortion laws similar to New York's present one on the argument that they violate fundamental liberties. A court test has been mounted here. At issue, basically, is the question whether the state can flatly deny women the right to have an abortion. This court test will almost inevitably involve an appeal and additional delay. The need for reform, in the meantime, remains acute. New York City's Health Commissioner estimated last year that 6,000 women resort to illegal abortions here annually. Such abortions stand as the major cause of maternal mor tality today. The Legislature, once more, confronts an opportunity to enact abortion reform or repeal. This is the for attion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Women Who'd Trade In Their Pedestal for Total Equality,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/02/04/archives/the-women-whod-trade-in-their-pedestal-for-total-equality-its-the.html,"IT'S RATHER disconcerting for a middle‐aged, securely middle‐class American businessman or professional to be confronted at a cocktail party by a blithe young creature who calls him, in a well‐modulated, girlish voice, an oppressor, a male chauvinist and a sexist. It's been happening lately.  It's equally shocking for college boys, post‐graduate white radicals and black militants to be presented by their sisters (blood and soul), wives, mothers and co workers with unnegotiable demands for liberation. That's been happening in creasingly, too. Liberated from what?, they wonder. Being American males, regardless of social, economic, political or racial hue, have they not been raised to believe that the American woman is the most privileged, pampered, and domineering of the species? Don't many American women agree? If perplexity is the mood of the moment, enlightenment is soon at hand. In the immediate and foreseeable future, America will be assaulted with the sub ject of women's liberation at the news stand and at the office, in the bookstore and in the living room. “It comes up in almost every social meeting. It's a current topic of conversa tion,” says Pamela Roby, a sociologist who, at 27 and happily unmarried, is one of countless sympathizers with, al though not quite members of, the women's liberation movement. Women's liberation is a catch‐all label for the second phase of the movement for total equality for slightly more than half of the United States population. In the first phase, women won the vote. Now they're going for broke. An eclectic movement, women's libera tion spans both reform and revolution, as well as practicing attorneys who wear hats to court and long‐haired poets in bell‐bottoms who forswear cosmetics and undergarments. On the matter of wedding rings and married names, the movement is of several minds. Ruthann Miller, who a candidate for State controller on the Socialist Workers Party slate, uses her husband's name because she dislikes her maiden name, McGivney, more. But she adamantly refuses the prefix “Mrs.” and puts her wedding ring on her right hand. Mrs. Irwin Schwartz, née Barbara‐Joan Levinson, an anthropologist who taught for four years at the New School as Barbara Schwartz, recently became Barbara Joans‐Schwartz. She is giving a women's liberation workshop this semester. Other charter members of the move ment like Robin Morgan, a poet who married to a poet, Kenneth Pitchford, and Kate Millett, the Barnard philosophy instructor who is the wife of Fumio Yoshimura, a sculptor, use their maiden names professionally and without fan fare. It's the Current Topic Women's liberation embraces such antithetical groups as NOW (the National Organization for Women formed in 1966 by Betty Friedan, author of “The Feminine Mystique”), which has men on its board of directors and strives for the enforcement of Title 7 of the 1964 Civil Rights Act (forbidding sex discrimination in employment), and the Feminists, an unknown quantity of separatists who seek female reparations on the style of veterans' preferences. Ti‐Grace Atkinson, a founding Feminist, has given up dating or even appearing in public with men except, of course, on TV. Women's lib, as its partisans sometimes call it, is an amoebalike organ ism that reproduces by simple break away. In between NOW and the Femin ists are a proliferating number of groups, cells and brigades that tend to use the vocabulary and many of the techniques of radical politics and black nationalism. Among the radical women's groups, most of whom now exclude men from their meetings and their strategy, are the Radical Feminists; WITCH (The Women's International Terrorist Con spiracy from Hell), The Older Women's Liberation (meaning over 30), Local 55, which accepts high school girls as well as grandmothers; the Stanton Anthony Brigade, which sees the enemy as man but the cause of oppression as psycho logical as well as economic, and Red stockings, which asserted in its July manifesto that all other forms of ex ploitation, like racism and imperialism, are extensions of male supremacy. Redstockings takes credit for the “con sciousness‐raising” technique, a kind of political encounter session in which women meet regularly to share their thoughts and experiences of male op pression. “Most of us had been to the shrink before joining women's lib,” said Susan Bell, a writer who is a member of both Redstockings and NOW. Whether it is called consciousness raising or rap session, it is a dead serious version of the age‐old kaffee klatsch. “We have to have talk sessions because we're confused,” said Laurie Stein, who belongs to the embryonic Barnard Women's Liberation. Miss Stein, a senior, was impelled toward the move ment by a classmate's “traumatic ex perience with abortion” and by her own feelings of intimidation in a class with Columbia boys. One group under the predominantly white women's liberation umbrella, the SNCC Black Women's Liberation Com mittee, sets itself the special task of helping black men recover their mas culinity and of restructuring the black family away from its matriarchal tradition. Regardless of differences, the move ment can supply a few clear and con certed replies to the question, what do they want to be liberated from? The first is abortion law. Repeal of abortion laws has the potential of such wide support that it is expected to gather Otherwise reluctant converts to women's liberation. Of four suits challenging the consti tutionality cif New York State's abortion ?? that will be heard in Federal court here starting April 15, one case has been dubbed the “woman's case” because has 300 plaintiffs and five women at torneys claiming that abortion laws deny a woman's right to privacy and her right to decide whether or not to bear chil dren. Control of her own body is women's liberation's most broadly based tenet. Restructuring Black Family “It's a beautiful thing to have a child, if that's what you want,” says Ruthann Miller, who plans to carry her 16‐month old daughter, Jennifer, with her in an abortion repeal parade planned for March 21. “But neither should you have one if you don't want to,” she added. Free child care centers are the next most popular cause. They would liberate women to pursue their own interests and to earn money. “It's tied to the need of most women to work. The country and the legislators are waking up. But it's not just a welfare issue. It should be a public right for women of all classes,” says Muriel Fox, a public relations executive and director of NOW, which believes child care cen ters should be state run and Federally subsidized. Ruthann Miller, a Trostskyite Com munist is in favor of having large cor porations support the centers, too. Most women's lib groups insist on parental control of the centers. Discrimination against women in busi ness, the professions and in the uni versity is the next most burning issue. The movement is loaded with angry writers like Elizabeth Fisher, who started a feminist literary magazine, “Aphra,” architects like Lucinda Osier, who insists that “the gentlemanly profession” dis criminates against women in architec ture school and on the construction site, and lawyers like Diane Schulder, who gave the first course on women's libera tion and the law at New York University Law School last semester. The Columbia Women's Liberation is concentrating its forces on securing gynecological care at the university health service, a university day care center and revision of the curriculum, which, it charges, neglects the history of women (to say nothing of their treat ment in Freud‐dominated psychology). Last month, the Columbia group is sued a report on discrimination of women in the faculty, a bias that it says in cludes under‐hiring as well as the habit of keeping women Ph.D's as part‐time lecturers when men who teach half‐time and work as consultants elsewhere can hold professorial status. “We must begin organizing working women, women in factories, office work ers,” Kate Millett says. “It's hard to get so many women to realize they're being paid so little because they've been fed the nonsense, ‘It's your pin money.’ For a widow with four kids or a woman whose husband makes too little, it's not pin money. It's grocery money.” If women are to become the equals of men at work, it follows that they will also have to be liberated from the archaic traditions of marriage, which include not only the exclusive burden of do mestic chores but the unrelenting pres sure on the brightest, most attractive girls to get married. “Many women will opt out of the family circle into living without marriage, occasionally with men, occasionally with out them,” Pamela Roby predicts for the seventies. “More and more it will be recognized that non‐marriage is a viable and satisfying alternative to marriage for both men and women.” Wants Corporations' Support “Homosexuality may be one viable alternative,” Robin Morgan suggests. Miss Morgan, who cares for her 6‐ month‐old son, Blake, in the mornings while her husband is at his office and then goes off to her editing job after he returns at 1 P.M., thinks the withering away of the institutions of marriage and family has already begun. “They were male‐invented anyway,” she says. “And one–third of American marriages end in divorce.” “Whatever replaces the nuclear family (the single family unit), women must devise,” she maintains. Like most wom en's liberationists, she ponders the ex tended family structure, as in the old style Italian family but without blood ties, or the Israeli‐brand kibbutz or commune. “A lot of us feel we've got to get rid of compulsory marriage,” Kate Millett says. “People who are in love are going to go on living together in marriage or not, if it doesn't mean women sacrific ing themselves to their children. We can keep the things about marriage that are attractive. Feminists are not out to kill love, but just to be sure it's the basis of the association.” What bothers many feminists is the confusion of women's liberation with sexual liberation. “Men immediately as sume liberation means sleeping with everyone,” Laurie Stein laments. “The whole point is to fight against dehuman izing sexual relations.” “Equality doesn't mean sameness,” she continues. “I still want a man to walk me home at night because if I'm mugged, his muscular structure is strong er than mine.” The ultimate goal of women's libera tion is for the sex heretofore labeled female to be accepted as full members of the human race. “I tend to think the idea of women getting their identity from men is a big problem to men,” Diane Schulder says. “It's like they've been carrying women on their shoulders all their lives. Men must get very tired,” she concluded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Accused Police Chief Quits in Cleveland,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/02/05/archives/accused-police-chief-quits-in-cleveland-accused-cleveland-police.html,"CLEVELAND, Feb. 4 — Wil liam P. Ellenburg, Cleveland's chief of police, resigned after 10 days in office today, con tinuing to deny charges that he took money from a Mafia attorney while a member of the Detroit police force.  Mayor Carl B. Stokes, who spent yesterday in Detroit in vestigating the charges, said he was accepting the resignation “with regret.” The Mayor named Inspector Lewis Coffey, who has been a member of the Cleveland Police Department for 31 years, as police chief. On Sunday, The Detroit Free Press said that a former Mafia attorney, Lawrence Burns, ad mitted paying money to Mr. Ellenburg and two other De troit police officers every month from 1959 to 1963 to protect an abortion clinic. “I came here because I be lieved I could help build the finest department in the coun try,” Mr. Ellenburg said today. “The events of the past few days have convinced me that it will be extremely difficult for me to reach that goal under the cloud created by the charges now circulating. “I wish to repeat that I cate gorically deny the allegations made against me. I realize, however, that those charges, until cleared, would seriously impair my effectiveness.” Mayor Stokes said at a City Hall news conference this morn ing that he had not asked for the police chief's resignation. The Mayor said that his per sonal investigation yesterday turned up no new information on the charges against Mr. Ellenburg, 50 years old, who served the Detroit Police De partment for 27 years. He re tired as a police inspector in 1968. “I want to make it very clear that I have no new information in regard to Mr. Ellenburg's record,” Mayor Stokes said. “To the best of my knowledge, Mr. Ellenburg is the victim of unproven accusations.” The Mayor named Inspector Coffey as chief after Mr. Ellen burg's statement and his own remarks. Chief Coffey was them sworn in. He becomes the fourth man to serve as police chief in Cleveland since Mayor Stokes was elected in 1967. The new chief, who is 58 years old, was responsible for organizing the department's Task Force, an enforcement unit set up to handle emergency situations. He served as field com mander during the riots in the city's Hough area in 1967. He had also served as night police chief. Chief Coffey had also been in charge of the Bureau of Ba sic Patrol, which includes all uniformed police, and the Bu reau of Operations.

CENTERS TO ADVISE ON GENETIC ILLS,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/02/05/archives/centers-to-advise-on-genetic-ills-5unit-network-is-formed-treatment.html,"The formation of a five‐cen ter network to counsel families and treat patients with genetic disorders was announced yes terday by the National Founda tion for Genetics and Neuro muscular Diseases. The network, although small, marks the beginning of a co ordinated effort to care for per sons concerned about a variety of relatively rare genetic dis orders that most doctors are poorly equipped to diagnose and treat. The centers are situated at Cornell University Medical Col lege in New York; Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore; the University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine in La Jolla; McGill University Faculty of Medicine in Montreal and City of Hope Medical Center in Duarte, Calif. Patients will be referred to a center by their physicians, who must first determine that there is some genetic disease in the family that might be passed on to future offspring. With the decline of infectious diseases as causes of death in children, genetic diseases have risen in importance. Today an estimated ratio of one in five childhood deaths is caused by a genetic disorder. In some cases, diagnosis of a genetic disorder has led to a treatment or to a means of prevention by performing ther apeutic abortions on women carrying affected children. In general, however, applica tion of the scientific firrdiiigs to families who have genetic diseases has suffered from a relative lack of facilities equipped to diagnose arid treat the many conditions and to counsel and follow up such patients. The new network, which has an initial funding of $500,000, is designed to meet this need, according to Dr. George W. Melcher Jr., president of the National Foundation for Gen etics and Neuromuscular Dis eases, a nonprofit organization that supports basic research and physician education in these areas. Patients at the centers will be advised of their chances of passing on a particular genetic disease. The centers will also treat patients with genetic diseases, when treatment is available. In some cases, the centers will prevent the birth of affected children through therapeutic abortions. Among the genetic diseases the network will deal with are glycogen storage diseases, in which a:missing enzyme results in an accumulation of starches in the body; the mucopolysac charidoses, in which the nervous system and bones are impaired; certain defects in red blood cells; a variety of incurable dis orders including Lesch‐Nyhan Syndrome, in which affected children compulsively mutilate themselves, and Tay‐Sachs dis ease, which causes degeneration of the nervous system and early death. Physicians who wish to refer patients to the genetic counsel ing network were advised to call 212‐265‐3166 Or write to the National Foundation for Genetics and Neuromuscular Diseases at 250 West 57th St., New York, N.Y.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tunisia's Placid Surface Conceals Currents of Disquiet,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/02/06/archives/tunisias-placid-surface-conceals-currents-of-disquiet.html,"TUNIS—Calm and satisfac tion have returned to the oases in Tunisia's southern desert and to the farms and truck gardens of the center and north after a period of agitation and re sentment. But that period has left enough traces to raise ques tions as to the Tunisians' ability to maintain the stability that has distinguished them in the Arab world.  A week's visit to the little North African country of five million people sandwiched be tween Algeria and Libya dis closes that beneath the placid surface there are undercur rents of tension and of un certainty about the future. Tunisia is still trying to dig herself out of two catastrophes that struck last year at a time when the leadership was slow ly passing from the strong hands of President Habib Bourguiba, a magnetic figure who has held a tight grip over his people since he won their fight for independence from France's protectorate in 1956. The first catastrophe was manmade—an effort to collecti vize the means of production, principally in agriculture, which collapsed in failure last summer. The other catastrophe came last fall when 39 days of rain caused great damage. The collectivization process began in 1964 under the lead ership of Ahmed Ben Salah, a young socialist‐minded labor leader, who over the years be came Tunisia's economic czar. He was Minister “of National Economy and Planning, includ ing agriculture, industry and commerce in his department, and he even acquired control of education. $1‐A‐Day Minimum Set Collectivization took the form of cooperatives into which landowners were forced to group their holdings, each being paid out of profits. La borers were supposed to get a daily minimum of half a dinar, about a dollar. The formation of the co operatives, based on the idea that they would be more effi cient and more equitable than small private holdings, began slowly but was abruptly stepped up a year ago. Nothing seemed to work out as planned, however. Farmers, resisting what seemed to them to be a loss of property and individuality, showed little in terest in their work, and pro duction and maintenance de clined on the farms. The cooperatives were inef ficiently and often amateurish ly managed and even on the best farm land most of the cooperatives were in deficit. Laborers went without pay and owners without profits. Or ganized resistance began to develop, and the national guard had to be called out to put down disorders in some areas. The effects were felt else Where. Commercial establish ments were forcibly placed under the cooperative system with many of the same results —loss of efficiency, a drop in work and the wiping out of profits. Private investment in industry and tourism, particu larly from abroad, slowed down because investors feared collectivization in those fields, too. Government subsidies to prop up the system weighed alarmingly on the budget. The Brakes Applied Although Mr. Bourguiba and the Destour party backed Mr. Ben Salah fully despite warn ings from other leaders, the President suddenly sensed the political danger in continuing a program that few Tunisians would back. In August he put the brakes on and Mr. Ben swift than his rise. He was thrown out of the Government, then out of the party and final ly out of his seat in the Na tional Assembly. A law was passed restoring all properties placed In coop eratives after January, 1969, to their owners, and the Govern ment gave assurances that “at no price shall we impose dog matic socialism on our people.” Tension eased considerably, and in November Mr. Bour guiba was re‐elected to a third five‐year term with 99.7 per sent of the vote. In Nefta, in the southern desert, the grizzled owner of 250 palm trees gesticulated in his flowing robes as he de nounced the cooperative for having replaced him. “The work was not getting done,” hé complained. In normal times, which have now returned, the trees are worked by laborers who, under a sharecropping system, get a fifth of the date production and turn four–fifths back to the owner. That allows him to spend a great deal of time in prayer in the mosque or in gos sip in the collee house. But even laborers seem hap pier under the private system. One explained that he did bet ter with his share of produc tion than with a daily wage of half a dinar partly because he was also free to work the small plots between the trees, grow ing truck produce such as to matoes, carrots and garlic. Both owner and worker reject the regimentation that went with the cooperative system. On the farms few political questions are being asked, but in educated circles in Tunis that is not the case. Mr. Bour guiba denounced Mr. Ben Salah as a man “thirsty for power” and “overly ambitious.” But, a young student said, “Ben Salah is paying for the others.” The student and his fellows, recalling that the former Min ister received full backing at the height of his power, main tain that the President and the party could not slough off re sponsibility that easily. Ousted for His Pains Ahmed Mestiri who was Minister f Defense until he resigned in January, 1968, was one of several voices raised in warning against what he felt was impending disaster. For his pains he was thrown out of the party. In an interview, Mr. Mestiri, a 44‐year‐old lawyer, said that Tunisia's single‐party system was valid for a country in her present stage of underdevelop ment but that “the system as it functions now is made for Mr. Bourguiba and cannot sur vive him.” He explained that with Mr. Bourguiba's uncontested lead ership, the party had become an appendage of political pow er in which free discussion was forbidden and popular senti ment had little chance of reach ing the top echelons. The tight ly controlled press does not afford an outlet for public dis cussion. Thinking of the Future Mr. Mestiri is not alone in thinking of the period after Mr. Bourguiba. The President, who is 66 years old, has been ailing with heart and liver trouble for a long time and has been under treatment in France for several months. One of the excuses made for his seeming lack of awareness of the climate of opinion has been his illness. Both that and his absence have made people concerned about the problem of succession. The President has taken steps to provide a smooth suc cession. The post of Premier was created recently and his closest associate and most faithful follower, Bahi Lad gham, was moved into it. In case of the President's death, he would automatically assume the office. Mr. Ladgham spent most of his political career in Mr. Bour guiba's shadow and his ability to lead the country still has to be tested. His speeches stress unity, but some Tunisians are doubtful that he can obtain it. The President's 42‐year‐old son, Habib Jr., who is the For eign Minister, is an example of the charm and likability that Ihave helped Tunisia keep on good terms with most of the world, but he is rarely men tioned as a contender for power. A new generation has grown to adulthood since Mr. Bour guiba and his associates gained independence. With the popu lation increasing by 3 per cent a year, the young are predom inant. For many of them, par ticularly students, Mr. Bour guiba already belongs to the past. He had urged Tunisian wom en to put aside the traditional role prescribed by Islam and to assume a place of equality as befits modern times, but when the young people, eagerly adopting his reforms, took to wearing miniskirts he disap proved. He is reported to have commented: “I did not ask you to remove your veils so that you can show thighs.” At the university a hard‐core opposition of leftists does not accept the paternalistic dicta torship of the President and the party and some have spent time in prison for subversion. Economic Setbacks Mr. Ladgham must contend riot only with such dissension but also with a rather precari ous economic and financial sit uation. The recent floods, ac cording to an estimate by Hedi Nouira, Governor of the Cen tral Bank, caused some $65‐mil lion in damage to roads, bridges, railroads and water works. The production and sales of phosphate, one of the few things Tunisia has to export, was set hack three months. Hundreds of thousands of fruit trees and date palms were damaged or destroyed. In Nefta and in Tozeur, and other south ern oases, a year's production was destroyed and make‐work projects with free food have had to be devised. The effects of the flood and the economic experimentation have been cushioned to some extent by large amounts of foreign aid. Per capita foreign aid over the last few years has been one of the highest in the world with the United States providing 40 per cent of a total of about $90‐million a year. “Everybody likes Tunisia,” remarked a diplomat. Mounting Foreign Debt The reverse side of the coin is that the country must de vote a quarter of export earn ings to service a mounting for eign debt. Despite heavy investment in tourism, industry and agricul ture, over‐all economic growth has not gone much beyond the population incerase. More than 30 per cent of the budget has been invested in education, but the Government has trouble keeping up with the population pressure. A birth‐control program is trying to reduce that pressure, but it is not always understood. At least one woman has been heard to complain that “try as I might I just can't swallow the coil.” Abortion has been legal ized after the fourth child, and export of labor to France, West Germany and Belgium is yet another way of relieving the pressure. Many of those who have re ceived some education and are no longer content to work in agriculture are swelling the ranks of the idle in the cities. Unemployment is estimated at almost a quarter of the active population, and despite the easy‐going nature of the coun try and its people, that adds to the feeling of uncertainty.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
High Court Asked To Upset an Edict Easing Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/02/07/archives/high-court-asked-to-upset-an-edict-easing-abortions.html,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 6 (UPI) — The Justice Department urged the Supreme Court today) to overturn a Federal judge's ruling that a District of Colum‐8 bia law was unconstitutional because it permits abortions only when the mother's life or health is in danger.  Government attorneys told the Court that District Judge Gerhard A. Gessell had in effect authorized physicians to per form abortions “for any reason whatsoever” when he struck down the 1901 statute last Nov. 10. Judge Gessell said he had made the decision because the law was unduly vague and be cause there was no way to decide what degree of danger was acceptable. The Justice De partment said the law should not have been declared uncon stitutional. “The unconditional availabil ity of abortions, unrelated to medical justification, is con trary to the manifest intent of Congress in enacting the... statute and is at odds with the abortion laws of many states,” the department said in a brief. Because Judge Gessell hand ed down his decision without hearing any evidence in the Government's case against Dr. Milan Vuitch, who was accused of violating the law, the Gov ernment was able to take its appeal directly to the Supreme Court. The appeal said Judge Ges sell should have tried the case to see if there was “a substan tial class of situations” in which the law could validly be applied.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Speaking of Books: Creative Dissertating,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/02/08/archives/speaking-of-books-creative-dissertating-creative-dissertating.html,"The revolting Japanese author Ken zaburo Oë says it is his favorite book; James Joyce drew extensively on it for the fluvial imagery of “Fin negans Wake”; Ernest Hemingway said—and there are few Americans who would disagree with him—that all American literature is derived from it. The book of course is “Huck leberry Finn.” Leaving aside the fact that the ap pearance of Nigger aim on the raft with a young honky offends the sensi bilities of the Black Panthers' Min ister of Culture and Social Develop ment, I wonder just how much in fluence this novel has on American graduate students today. I am not thinking specifically of the story‐line (which has plucked at Yankee heart strings since 1885); no, I am thinking of the author's caveat which prefaces the story. It goes as follows: “Persons attempting to find a motive in this narrative will be prosecuted; persons attempting to find a moral in it will be banished; persons attempting to find a plot in it will be shot.” For the man who was later to refer irritably to the world's “snivelization” and “the goddamned human race” the above still counts as pretty strong language — “fighting talk,” as they say out West. And for anyone who has recently been leafing through the bulky, thrice‐yearly issues of “Dis sertation Abstracts” (Series “A”) that caveat is a cause for some genuine worry. One does not worry very much about the man at Yale who last year finished and abstracted his “A Kicka poo Grammar” (it seems to be an Algonquin dialect) or even the chap at Notre Dame who last year wrote “Outside the Whale: George Or well's Search for Meaning and Form” (the title all‐too‐typical of the feeble academic jokes that appear to pass for dissertation topics; for ex ample, a lady at the University of Washington called hers “The First Making of ‘The Making Of Ameri cans,’” perhaps hoping that her little joke would justify a lengthy examina tion of Gertrude Stein's unforgivable monstrosity). Neither does one lose sleep over the scores of dissertations on Saul Bellow's symbols (“The Schlemiel as Metaphor ...”) or on the variorum “Catch‐22.” I think any one would agree these are harmless little passions, and they must keep in stitches. What exercises me is something else: it is the steady production of what appears in “Dissertation Ab stracts” (Series “A”) under the sub heading “Language and Literature, Modern.” I refer to the “Original Nov els”; they are sometimes called “Or iginal Creative Projects and Practi cals” by American universities. They are written for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. Glancing through them several things become clear: all the candidates have three names, most are at the University of Iowa (the rest are at the University of Denver), and the subject of each “Original Novel” is a young man with a big problem, usually philosophical, the heroes being of an unusually sensitive turn of mind. The abstracts of the other (un original?) dissertations begin in a standard way: “This study traces the evolution of Edna Ferber's anti‐hero from narcissistic yearnings to ...” The abstracts of the “Original Novels” are similar, though veer sharply to ward symbolic fulsomeness, and it is these that I think are causing Mark Twain's crusty old bones to whirr in his grave. But they illustrate a curious aspect of the American uni versity process and so seem worth our attention. Last year saw the completion of “The Stormy Petrel,” an “Original Novel” of 470 typed pages by the American author (now Doctor), Har ry Frew Waidner III. Dr. Waidner writes in his abstract, “This novel, a Bildungsroman, falls into two sec tions, the first constituting an ex tended preface to the second, much longer part, which is in journal form. In the preface the narrator‐protago nist traces his moral and intellectual development from boyhood to his present age, twenty, by way of estab lishing acute ethical consciousness and the....” Dr. Waidner goes on to say that his hero (unnamed) goes to an Alpine town “in the hope of resolving his ethical doubts” but “is subverted in his truth‐seeking intentions by shrewd and cynical young man of his own age who exercises a fascination over him.... The climax of the novel involves the realization on the part of the narrator of the dehuman izing effect this fascination has had upon him ...” So much for the story. But that is the least important feature of “The Stoney Petrel.” Now for the really symbolic part. Dr. Waidner contin ues: “This general motif of retrogres sion is paralleled stylistically in the novel, since the work proceeds from the rather simple of expression to the complex (intricate sentence structure and — more especially — the employ ment of an extensive vocabulary, foreign and archaic terms), there thus being reflected further dehumaniza tion, to wit, the progressive subor dinating of human values and con cerns to the ... non‐human, aes thetically‐ rather than ethically‐or iented mode of their representation.” This little Bildungsroman is avail able from the publishers of “Disserta tion Abstracts” (Series “A”) for $21.15; the microfilm is considerably cheaper at $6 only. It is hard to say whether “Go a Crooked Mile” had any profound in fluence over “The Stormy Petrel,” but it is a fact that “Go” was written the year before in the very same city in Iowa by Victor Jay Emmett Jr. That Dr. Emmett Jr. may never have had much to do with Dr. Waidner III is somewhat apparent from the tone and texture of the abstract Dr. Em mett Jr. wrote for his own “Original Novel.” For one thing the novel's setting is not the Alps. He writes: “The novel opens with a wedding in a small college town in Iowa. The bride, Louise Bell, is in the ladies' room vomiting.” An engaging open ing; there is a good reason for Louise to be vomiting: she is pregnant and has morning sickness. Blacky Blake, the groom, had nothing to do with this. The father of the child, David Herbert (“an art student whose works are devoted to the celebration of The Great Mother Goddess”), is hiding in the choir loft waiting to take Louise's picture “from which he plans to make a statue. He thinks marriage degrades a woman.” The picture is never snapped, for “the rest of the novel traces the lives of these characters up to the time of the wedding.” Dehumanization does not figure very heavily in Dr. Emmett Jr.'s nov el, but he does have something to say about Providence. And it is bad news for the Archbishop of Iowa City, I'm afraid. The clergyman who mar ries Blacky and Louise underwent “a religious conversion during a storm at sea” but later “following the death of his wife in a senseless accident he becomes convinced that he is an ex ception to the general rule of Provi dential supervision....” Dr. Emmett Jr.'s supervision was done by assistant professor William Murray. Farther west, the University of Denver dipped its oar into the main stream of American fiction with Richard Sikes Johnson's preface and three novellas, written for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy last year. Dr. Johnson begins his abstract by listing the writers who have influ enced the modern novel. He mentions the name of Thomas Nashe, then skips 250 years to Henry James, Flaubert, Ford and Conrad—a mighty leap, but with some justification. Their emphasis, he says, “has been on the autonomy of characters and upon the objectification of action; in other words, the tendency has been ...” The meat of Dr. Johnson's disser tation is three “original” novellas, “The Swindler,” “The Applicant” and “The Loser.” I was disturbed by Dr. Johnson's comment on “The Swindler”: “... the psychological conflict ... suffered by Jerry McCoy following an abortion which is per formed on his wife....” I was look ing for something more (as Dr. Waid ner III put it) “aesthetically‐ rather than ethi cally‐oriented.” I did not find this in “The Applicant” (this “emphasizes the plight in our culture of aging persons who seek employment, but again as in ‘The Swindler,’ the story is told from the psychological point of view of the protago nist....”). “The Loser” ended my search. The abstract held me. Howard Courtney, the epony mous hero, “owes his life to a chaplain who gave Howard his own life‐jacket when the Pres cott, a troopship, was torpedoed in the Pacific. Haunted by a sense of guilt and by the moral implications of the gift he re ceived from the chaplain, How ard seeks out the chaplain's son, Jack Kendall, who is a sheriff in a small Texas town.” Somehow, Howard manages to worm himself into getting ap pointed deputy sheriff, and the nub of the story is that he protects Jack from an impend ing grand‐jury investigation. “In doing so,” writes Dr. John son, “Howard betrays his own sense of integrity. Caught in the moral ambiguities of his life, Howard discovers that he hates the chaplain who died so that Howard could live.” This struck me as rather un grateful of Howard, as indeed it would be for anyone who survived being torpedoed in the Pacific. Chaplain Kendall was only doing his duty, but leave it to Howard to mess things up. The lesson is that if you want to go around betraying your sense of integrity you should not do it in a small Texas town. (Howard might have fared better in the small college town in Iowa of “Go a Crooked Mile” where the onto logical shot‐gun wedding took place.) But then in Original Novel‐Land you get caught in moral ambiguities wherever you go. In the manner of another sensitive American, Edgar Al lan Poe, many of the Ph.D.'s who write in “Dissertation Ab stracts” (Series “A”) preface their original fiction and poetry with a theory of art. Paul Wal lace Anderson does this in the abstract of his 1966 disserta tion, “The Perfect Animal”: “The purpose of this disserta tion is to present original po etry together with a critical apparatus in which theoretical principles motivating the poetry are defined or discussed.” This is ambitious, but there is more. Dr. Anderson discusses in his preface the “function of poe try” and gives “A quick but fairly comprehensive survey of a dozen of the leading literary critics of the past half‐century.” This is followed by his 30 original poems which he de scribes: “The variable subject matter, tone, point of view, and intention generally, preclude commitment to any single school or tradition of poetry. Of the many forms employed in these poems, those in free verse and in syllabics are clos est to the critical theory pre sented. The sought‐for style, which resides somewhere be tween the plain and eloquent styles, is more nearly achieved in the poems written in syl labics.” I was wondering where the sought‐for style was residing It was in Denver, Colo., be tween the plain and eloquent styles all along! Can you beat that. It is not really to the point, though. Dr. Anderson started his theory of poetry by stating quite baldly that poetry fulfills a religious function. His conclusion is: write in syllabics. It is cheering to get something so concrete in the abstracts. And writing in syllabics is much better than getting dehuman ized in the Alps or catching yourself in moral ambiguities in a small Texas town or even, for that matter, vomiting all over your maternity wedding outfit in a ladies' room in Iowa. Frankly, the more I read of “Dissertation Abstracts” (Se ries “A”) the clearer it becomes that graduate students are be ing weaned away from “Huck leberry Finn,” and this might also account for the fact that whenever I pick up a copy of The Straits Times (Singapore) I read about graduate students on university campuses in the United States today being prosecuted, banished and shot by angry police.

Oh! Copenhagen!,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/02/08/archives/oh-copenhagen-oh-copenhagen.html,"COPENHAGEN. ON July 1, Denmark became the first Western nation to re move legal prohibitions against the production and sale of hard‐core pornography to adults—that is, any one at least 16 years old. In Octo ber, the leaders of the already flour ishing pornography industry, like their counterparts in pleasure‐boat ing, electronics or home‐furnishings, hired a public‐relations man and put on a trade show to display their wares.  The show was an enormous com mercial, if not an artistic, success. Something like 50,000 persons, pay ing $1.50 each, bulged the walls of Copenhagen gymnasium where the exhibit, called the sexmesse, or sex fair, had its one‐week run. Most of the spectators were Danish, of course, but smut merchants and unofficial delegations of dirty old men streamed in from Germany, Britain and the United States, which are reputedly the world's largest per capita con sumers of pornography, it being re garded as more evil there than any where else, and from Italy and France, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Japan. Many of these foreign visitors seemed to be unable to cope with the new freedom. They skulked from booth to booth—displays of books and photo albums presided over by topless go‐go girls, nonstop lewd films alongside which “I Am Curious —Yellow” could be shown at kiddie matinees, arsenals of vibrators, riding crops, chains, boots, wasp‐waist cor sets, erotic lingerie, potency en hancers and other objects even more bizarre—as though they were follow ing a postcard vender down a dark alley in Beirut. The change in the pornography law had received only passing men tion in the world press, but the sex fair brought scores of correspondents to Copenhagen. Their vivid dis patches led defenders of morality in other lands to announce that they could smell the brimstone rising over the Skagerrak and feel the first tremors of the wrath that was certain to overtake those who had turned green and placid land and a story book capital of copper spires and mellow brick into a latter‐day Sodom. Dr. Berl Kutschinsky, a researcher at the University of Copenhagen who had been assigned a few months earlier by the Commission on Por nography and Obscenity in Washing ton to study the effects of legaliza tion on his countrymen, deployed half‐dozen of his graduate students to the gymnasium to ask questions. Soon afterward the commission flew over some of its own experts to assist him. Kutschinsky's findings, which are not yet complete, are expected to influence strongly the commission's final report, which will be submitted to the White House before it goes out of existence on Aug. 31. At present, Federal, state and local pornography statutes are a contradictory patchwork. New York and San Francisco, for example, per mit almost everything except the photographic depiction of actual sex acts. In many parts of the South and Midwest pictures of girls in bikinis are still regarded with discomfort. The Danes themselves, both those who attended it and those who did not, were inclined to regard the sex fair with amused detachment. Many mildly deplored its poor taste and sensation‐mongering. Others betrayed a certain embarrassment when dis cussing it, as they might an inept performance by the Royal Ballet. The open commercialism of the sex fair may have been less offensive. Foreign sales of pornography during 1969 were estimated as high as $50‐mil lion. As an export, pornography will never rank with porcelain, silver ware, furniture, dairy products or hams and bacon as a prestige item, but several Danes I talked to noted slyly that the unblushing exertions of their young men and women were helping to offset a persistent trade deficit. “That's what I call progress,” a Danish journalist said, repeating quip that was making the rounds. “From blue cheese to blue movies.” THE sex fair may have come as a shock to the rest of the world, but for the Danes it was merely the most recent step in a social evolution that has been going on here, and at about the same pace in neighboring Swe den, for 150 years. Long before the rest of Europe, the Danes were con cerned with public education and health, working conditions, housing, land ownership for farmers, the de velopment of cooperative enterprises, and the rights of women and chil dren. Social action led to political changes. By the start of this century the power of the king and the nobility had passed, without blood shed, to the freely elected Parliament. The great figure in this movement was a clergyman, Bishop N. F. S. Grundtvig. He and Hans Christian Andersen are Denmark's most re vered nonroyal figures. In his long lifetime, Grundtvig, who died in 1873 at the age of 89, not only led the social reformation but also, almost singlehandedly, transformed the aus tere Lutheranism of the established church into a religion of forgiveness, hope and joy. Shaped by these forces, the Danish character nowadays is usually de scribed as pleasure‐loving but un romantic, nonviolent and resolutely unheroic, pragmatic and common sensical. There is much about the Danes that suggests that they are the descendants of the Hobbits of Middle Earth, whose existence has been made known by J. R. R. Tolkien, even to their fondness for well‐tilled fields, groaning dining tables and birthday parties, and their tendency toward indolence. French and Ital ians, while pursuing Danish girls all over Europe, lament the Danes' lack of a sense of the grandeur and tragedy of life. In Sweden the stereo type of the Dane is a rosy‐oheeked machine for eating and love‐mking, devoid of subtlety, mysticism and passion. As proof, the Swedes point out that Kierkegaard, Denmark's most notable philosopher and a far less cheerful character than Bishop Grundtvig, is all but ignored in his native land. (The Danes reciprocate these views, regarding their Swedish cousins as icebound, aloof and morbid.) IN recent years the Danish Gov ernment, which regards human free dom as something more than the subject for patriotic speeches, has pretty well gone out of the business of trying to regulate the sex lives of adults. Everyone is free to follow his fancy, whether it is homosexuality, group sex, consorting with prosti tutes, or the wearing of the attire of the opposite sex, to name a few of the tangential directions in which people are apt to go in pursuit of sexual pleasure. Homosexuality bears no particular stigma, but free or low‐cost psychiat ric help is available to anyone who is distressed by this orienta tion. (In the United States, of course, the situation is re versed.) Technically speaking, prostitution—heterosexual or homosexual—is legal only if it is not the prostitute's sole means of support. In practice, police and social agencies urge young prostitutes to seek other occupations and stand ready to help with guidance, vocational training and the like, but those who show no inclination to change are per mitted to go their way. No comprehensive statistics are available, but Danish and for that matter many Ameri can experts see no reason to suppose that deviant sexuality is more common in Denmark than it is in the United States, where such acts must often be carried on in deep secrecy and with the risk of jail or disgrace if they come to light. “People don't willfully be come homosexuals, transves tites or prostitutes,” said Dr. John Gagnon of the State Uni versity of New York's Stony Brook, L.I., campus and a for mer staff member of the In stitute for Sex Research. “The impulse goes far deeper than that.” Knud Thestrup, the Danish Minister of Justice and a member of the Conservative party, has summed up the view of his Government. “We believe,” he said, “that the apparatus of justice should not be applied where there is only a moral issue. It is the responsibility of the individual to select his own way of life.” In any event, the Danes are convinced that, far from being seduced by pornography, the average person soon loses in terest in it. The reasons for getting hung up on it, as with sexual deviation, almost cer tainly go far deeper than its mere availability. THE events that led to the legalizing of pornography be gan in 1964, when the Danish publisher of “Fanny Hill,” the 18th‐century erotic classic, was prosecuted for obscenity. He was acquitted, and the verdict led, as have similar verdicts in many states in the United States, to the publica tion of a flood of similar works, several of which were also taken into court. “It became almost a sport for publishers to issue a book and sell the entire issue be fore the police could obtain seizure order,” the Ministry of Justice has commented. “For the public, a confisca tion became little more than extra advertising, and proof that a book fulfilled its prom ise of being hard‐core por nography.” Unlike the United States Supreme Court, which worked out a doctrine of redeeming social importance, Danish judges said they were unable to devise a sure‐fire formula for separating worthy works from those that were obscene. The ministry, to end a situa tion that it called “intoler able,” asked the permanent criminal‐law committee, com prising the ombudsman—the head of the government office that protects citizens against abuses by the state—the di rector of public prosecutions and an appeals‐court chief justice, to study the existing law and recommend changes. After hearing scores of ex pert witnesses and members of the public, the committee proposed that printed ma terial, but not pictures, be removed from government regulation. In the spring of 1967 the Parliament made the recommendation law. Almost immediately, the sales of printed pornography, deprived of the spice of illegality, dropped sharply; at the same time publishers, anticipating further successful court tests, flooded the market with pho tographic pornography. Once again books were seized and the same old legal questions arose: Was a book of color photographs of sexual inter course in various positions a guide for married or engaged persons, as its publisher con tended, or was it nothing but to lust? A 17‐member parliamen tary committee, headed by Jorgen Langkilde, a Conser vative deputy, lawyer and former career police official, took up the question, holding hearings from October, 1968, through last May. “There was some doubt at first that the results of the liberation of pic torial pornography would be the same as that of written pornography,” said Langkilde, a gray‐haired, broad‐shoul dered man, puffing on his pipe. “Pictorial pornography seemed more far‐reaching in its effects; at any rate, you have to be literate to read the stories. But the testimony seemed to make clear that the public for pornography was men between the ages of 45 and 60 or 70. The young were just not interested, by and large, but when something is illegal it always has a certain additional fascination.” So the committee recom mended that all restrictions on pornography be removed, except for its sale to children under 16 and its blatant dis play in shop windows, of fenses that are punishable by a fine. “We weren't quite sure that it was right to set any limit,” Langkilde said, “since everything we heard indicated that pornography simply wasn't inherently harmful to anyone, but there seemed to be a good deal of support for it, and we wanted to get the bill through.” The only or ganized public protests came from some members of the country's evangelical churches, hardly more than 1 per cent of the population, and from the austere and only slightly more numerous faction of the established church that is called the Inner Mission, which has its strength in the remote, bleak, farming region of western Jutland. The bill passed, 112 votes to 25, on May 30 and became law on July 1. Nor has the fight for reform ended. Either this year or next Parliament, under steady pressure from Denmark's fe male population, is expected to liberalize the divorce law, which presently requires two‐year period of separation before the granting of the decree, and the abortion law, which requires medical testi mony that childbearing would be emotionally or physically harmful to the mother to ter minate the pregnancy. IN 1967, the year in which printed pornography was le galized, the number of alleged sex offenses reported to the police in Copenhagen dropped 25 per cent from the preced ing year. There was another 10 per cent drop in 1968. Despite the legalization of all pornography in the last six months of 1969, the figures declined even more dramati cally for the year, down by 31 per cent. All this is directly contrary to what the advo cates of censorship have been saying, but the figures may nevertheless be somewhat misleading. Most of the offenses re ported in Copenhagen are relatively minor — accosting, voyeurism, exhibitionism and it has been suggested that while they may be as numerous as ever, fewer women are frightened or an noyed enough nowadays to complain to the police. Violent crimes are rare. Accusations of rape average only 200 or so a year for the entire country. The evidence is re garded as sufficient for prose cution in only 25 or 30 cases. There are hardly more than 10 or 15 murder cases a year all told—a figure that is sure passed on a single lively week‐end in New York or Chi cago—and only one or two are thought to be sexually related. Going over these figures, Alex Haslund, the director of the criminal investigation di vision of the Copenhagen police, said, “We feel much more anxious about brutality and violence on television and in the films than in pornog raphy. It seems to be quite clear that pornographic books do not create sex criminals. In fact, it probably works the other way around, permitting many of them to satisfy whatever urges they have in private. But we do see now and then, in cases of violent attack, that criminals use tricks that they say they've seen in the movies or on tele vision.” “Aside from a few pioneering orgiasts and wife‐swappers no one really knows how anyone else goes about having sexual relations.” Nor do other statistics indi cate that sexual permissive ness is causing Danish society to fall apart. In 1968, the most recent year for which figures are available, there were 39,471 marriages and 7,572 divorces. No marked changes were seen in the first six months of 1969. In the United States, by contrast, about one of four marriages ends in divorce. The rate of Denmark's out ‐ of ‐ wedlock births, 11.2 per cent in 1968, is thought to be about the same as it was 150 years ago, according to church records of the period. Many Danish mothers remain unmarried by choice and continue at their jobs, since the state provides excellent nurseries and other assistance. There has been slight rise in the rate of venereal disease. In 1968 it stood at 2.2 cases per 1,000 in the 16‐to‐19 age bracket, the most heavily afflicted, an in crease of about 20 per cent over the preceding year. How ever, public health officials believe that few cases go undetected and untreated. (The rate among young people in New York may be 10 times as high.) PERHAPS the most in fluential advocates of sex ual freedom in Denmark are Sten and Inge Hegeler, a busy couple who are practicing psychotherapists and mem bers of the Copenhagen Uni versity faculty. They have written several books—“The ABZ of Love” is the best known in the United States— and conduct a weekly news paper column of sexual ad vice that appears throughout Scandinavia and attracts more than 500 letters a week from readers. Although it might seem to an American visitor that Den mark moans happily under the rule of Aphrodite, the Hege lers believe that the battle of liberation has hardly begun. “Tim acceptance of the fact of having a sexual life is just starting,” said Inge Hegeler. “Below the surface Denmark isn't much different from Kansas.” She is a slim, red‐haired woman. She met her husband while they were students at the university in the late nineteen‐forties. They were married only after they had lived together for a couple of years, she told me with a touch of pride. Sten Hegeler is stocky and reflective, a smoker of white clay pipes. “The sex fair was dread ful,” he said. “There is the ugliness and exploitation that you might expect when an ancient taboo is being de stroyed. At that, I prefer porno to violence and murder, and think the word pornography ought to be replaced by some thing more descriptive and not just reflecting moral atti tudes.” The Hegelers cheerfully de scribe themselves as fanatics in trying to get people to accept sex as a natural part of their lives, a pastime to be indulged in without guilt of any sort. Like other clinicians and researchers in Denmark, they believe that the genera tion that is now under 30 has largely succeeded in conquer ing its guilt feelings. The problem conies from those who are older, they said, par ticularly parents. “Girls are told, ‘Don't go to bed unless you are in love,’” Inge Hegeler said one cold afternoon in the living room of their comfortably cluttered apartment. “I disagree. How can a girl know? What she thinks is love is almost al ways an infatuation.” The answer, she said, is for sex to come first. Mutual sexual pleasure, the absence of which causes so many marriages to break up, is usually a sturdier platform, in her view, on which to build an enduring relationship, than the dazzling glow of sudden love. In the case of sex, she went on, there can't be too much of a good thing. Danes are great trenchermen, eating five or six times a day, and the Hegelers, who often ex press themselves in gastro nomic metaphors, believe that anyone who has the leisure and energy to operate on a similar orgasmic timetable should have no qualms about doing so. Masturbation is an entirely worthy outlet, Inge Hegeler went on. “If you haven't the time or appetite for a full meal, then you take a snack.” THEIR mail indicates, the Hegelers said, that the great est sexual problem in Scandi navia, and probably elsewhere in the Western world, is that women are insufficiently aroused before sexual inter course. Letters by the hun dreds come to them from chronically unfulfilled wives and girl friends. Another source of difficulty is the in creasing social and sexual isolation in which many fami lies live. Everything happens behind drawn blinds in sub urban split‐levels. Aside from a few pioneering orgiasts and wife‐swappers, no one really knows how anyone else goes about having sexual relations. For many people there is always the nagging suspicion that they are missing some thing good. The Hegelers believe people ought to help one another with such problems. “Suppose you're having trouble winding spaghetti around your fork in a restaurant,” said Inge Heg eler, waxing gastronomical again. “You look at the peo ple at another table who are also eating spaghetti. You watch them and you learn how to do it yourself.” In this spirit the Hegelers are participants; although they remain on the sexual sidelines as it were, in a film that they hope will help to disperse the fog of anxiety and ignorance that shrouds the peaks of coital bliss. It is called “Ker lighedens Sprog”—“The Lan guage of Love”—and I went to see it a few days after it opened in Copenhagen thought it was excellent, par ticularly in view of the fact that the term sex‐education film conjures up images of faded posters at theaters on the wrong side of town, broken seats and the odor of disinfectant, blurry shots of what may or may not be loitering prostitutes on a rainy afternoon in place like Bucharest in about 1910, and a quick dissolve to the offices of the venereal‐diseases specialist. “There are no innocent children; they are just unpracticed” Stan Hegeler had a few reservations about his film. “It's a little too sentimental for my taste,” he said. “Too many shots of the sun gleam ing on the water and the breezes rustling the leaves. There's something very mis leading about all that out door love‐making. Women prefer the bed, where there are no ants or twigs.” MANY persons of other wise libertarian temperament believe that pornography ought to be suppressed be cause of its damaging ef fects on children, who inevi tably get their hands on it if it is widely available to adults. The opinion of the psychiatrists in Copenhagen that I talked to seemed to be that the malign powers of pornography are much exag gerated. Even the effects of precocious sexuality or sexual assault, it is suggested, may be less harmful than the hys teria, fright and guilt that such events induce in parents, neighbors, the police and the courts. (Young victims of sex offenses are permitted to tes tify as a last resort, or not at all, in many European coun tries.) “If you read a crime story and find it fascinating, it doesn't make you a criminal,” said Dr. Preben Hertoft, a psychiatrist at the state mental hospital at Glostrop, a Copenhagen suburb, and a specialist in the emotional problems of the young. “It is the same with pornography. Pornography is a fantasy, a daydream— like ‘Superman’ It is a supernatural world. To read about men who have 10 orgasms a night, about women who are always ready to lie down — even children know that such things aren't so.... There will always be problems between parents and children regarding sexual maturation. Intellect and emotion are at war. Parents may know that the beginning of sexual ac tivity is perfectly natural, but they can't help being upset, particularly when it's a daugh ter.” Although Denmark has been far ahead of most other coun tries in countenancing the sexual activities of the young, it has been oddly lax in pro viding them with the informa tion they need. Until recently only about half of the schools in the country, and these mainly in the larger cities, offered courses in sex educa tion. The subject is now being made mandatory, but officials at the Ministry of Education told me that they were having trouble in finding persons who were academically and emo tionally qualified to teach it. At a school in a working class suburb of Copenhagen, sex education begins in the fourth grade, but the library contains copies of the Hege lers' “Hvordan, Mar?”—“How, Mommy?” in the English translation—and the younger children are free to read it. In the junior‐high‐school grades, a textbook shows sexual acts in softly lighted, decorously posed photographs. The high‐school students look not much different from American youngsters. The girls wear plaid skirts and sweaters or blouses and the boys suit jackets or sweaters. They are serious and attentive as Ole Bach, the biology in structor, leads them through lesson in the anatomy of the reproductive system. Later, in the teachers' lounge, over a bottle of red wine, cheese and crackers, he said, “I do not like those anatomical Charts. They are too graphic, with their reds and yellows. The human body looks like a side of beef have asked for simpler, more stylized, drawings.” The headmaster, Preben Jorgensen, and the librarian, Jorgen Jorsun, then joined us. In response to a question, Jorgensen said that pornog raphy circulated in the school. He deplored it because of its crude explicitness, ugly and aggressive, without any re flection of tenderness and no pleasure beyond the momen tary spasm of male ejacula tion. “Seeing such things a girl might say, ‘Oh, I could not do that’” Jorgensen said. “We say, ‘That is not the way it is; the reality is much bet ter.’” “In one of my classes not long ago,” Bach said, “one of the girls raised her hand. Teacher, Robert has stolen my porno book, she said. Everyone laughed. I said, Well, since it's obvious that you can't live without it, Rob ert will have to give it back to you.” “That's one thing I don't like about American life,” Jorgensen said. “The insist ence on their ‘innocent’ chil dren. There are no innocent children; they are just un practiced. The American sys tem is too high‐flown and unreasonable, demanding love and marriage. Sometimes we must do sex only for sex.” Did he have children him self, I asked? “Yes,” he said. Anticipating my next question, he went on, “I have a daughter of 16. She has the freedom to bring her boyfriend to her bedroom and she does so when she wants.” There was nothing wrong, the three men agreed, for married persons occasionally to seek other partners. “You can do this and still love your wife,” the librarian said. How would they feel about their wives doing the same thing, I asked. There was a sudden crescendo of silence. “I would be able to tolerate it per fectly,” the librarian said. “The only thing is that might compare the other man to myself. ‘How was it?’ would ask. If my wife said he was better than me, I don't think I'd be completely happy about it.” *** AS they push out the boun daries of sexual freedom, some Danes are questioning the value of traditional family life. “Why must it always be the woman who stays at home?” Jorgensen, the head master, had asked. “If she is cleverer than the man, and can earn more, why shouldn't she work and the man stay home? The family system is itself perhaps wrong.” An alternative is emerging. It is the storfamilia, literally “extended family,” or com mune. A dozen or more have been established in the past few years. The only thing they have in common with communes in the United States is the name. Almost without exception members of Ameri can communes are trying to separate themselves from so ciety. They try to live simply, more often primitively, dedi cating their lives to something like organic farming, Eastern religions, drugs or the antici pation of the apocalypse. The Danish communes, I was told, represent a serious effort to devise a pleasanter and more rational way of living to gether within society — a means of simplifying house hold work and child care, providing recreation and in general enhancing the lives of the members. Peter Rasmussen, a 27‐year‐ old architect, is a founding member of a commune that has been methodically getting itself organized for two and a half years now. Its mem bers, 12 couples and 11 chil dren, do not yet live together, but they spend their week ends and vacations in one another's company. For the past year and a half, Ras mussen said, each couple has deposited $75 a month into a fund. This year the amount will increase to $105 and by summer they will have enough to make a down payment on the land where they expect to build their communal dwelling. Rasmussen already has drawn the plans—duplex apartments, common rooms, a patio, swimming pool, kin dergarten room. “The traditional family is too separated,” Rasmussen said. “It is possible”—be likes to talk about what he calls “possibilities”—“that it might be a good thing to give chil dren a choice of parents in stead of just one set. Each member of the commune has something to give to every other member.” Sexual freedom among the commune members is taken for granted. In some com munes group sex sessions— the older term is orgies—take place at regular intervals. Rasmussen does not approve, but only because he believes that such activities should not become a matter of routine. Neither, of course, should they be prohibited. “We are very relaxed about it,” he said. “We are all friends and we regard sex as an expression of friendship. If we don't find it nice, let's stop.” * * * IN 1967, Dr. Joakim Israel, professor of sociology at the University of Copenhagen, who was then teaching at the University of Uppsala in Swe den, surveyed the sexual practices and attitudes of 3,000 young persons in Stock holm. His findings, he told me, would have been about the same if he had asked his questions in Copenhagen, and in all likelihood not so very much different in Cleveland or Tenafly, N.J. The median age of first sexual intercourse, he found, was just under 16 years for boys and just under 17 for girls. Studies dating back to the early years of the century indicate that this age level has been dropping steadily. What is more significant, Dr. Israel believes, is that sexual maturation has also been occurring at an earlier age, so that the length of time between maturation and first intercourse has remained pretty much unchanged. Dr. Israel also found that a sort of rough ethical system had largely replaced the moral code, which was often honored in the breach in any event, of their parents and grandparents. The youngsters in his survey rejected “pet ting to a climax,” that is, mutual masturbation, as un natural, preferring sexual in tercourse. Al the same time he found strong self‐imposed barriers against both promis cuity and sexual intercourse in which the partners had no strong emotional ties to each other. In this respect, at least, they show little desire to fol low the views of the Hegelers, who consider the achievement of mutual sexual pleasure a necessary prerequisite to a sound emotional relationship. To Dr. Israel the evolution of a distinct youth culture is the logical outcome of several developments that have be come most marked since the end of World War II. The continuing transformation from dominantly agrarian to industrial and urban societies in the West has led to the replacement of the informal social control of the family and village by the state. At the same time the physical welfare of the individual, once a private matter, has become a pubic concern, while sexual controls, until recently a matter of fairly strict state supervision, are being handed back to the individual. In Dr. Israel's formulation, the end of the long period of capital accumulation in the West, which according to Weberian theory was the root cause of the rise of puritanism with its ethic of abstinence, has been followed by the en couragement of consumption. (Sexual Victorianism an remains the rule in Communist na tions, which are still trying to rapidly build their capital structure.) It is difficult to encourage gratification of ev ery desire but the sexual, particularly when contracep tives and antibiotics have nul lified the two most serious hazards — pregnancy and ve nereal disease. Moreover, the lengthening of the time that young people remain in school enforces economic depend ence on parents and tends to rule out marriage at a time when a man's sexual impulse is at its peak. MANY investigators, be ginning with Kinsey, have found a correlation between socio‐economic class and the start of sexual activity, in that working‐class youths are usually quicker off the mark than the sons and daughters of the middle class. One rea son for this is that middle and upper ‐ middle ‐ class young sters, being more likely to re main in school longer, have been conditioned to believe that energy that is devoted to sex is not available for intel lectual activity. Dr. Israel believes that this widely held notion is incor rect. “It is Freud's essentially mechanistic view of man as a container for a certain amount of energy,” he said. “Man might better be likened to a cybernetic system. It seems to me more likely that the ‘feed back’ of sexual activity stim ulates creative and intellectual accomplishment. In any case, it reduces the amount of time spent on obsessional sexual fantasies.” Pornography, “Puritanism turned inside out” in Dr. Is rael's phrase, can of course stimulate such fantasies in the lonely and inexperienced, but it is far less likely to interest persons with a satisfying sex life of their own. It is for this reason, he suggests, that young people are much less interested in pornography than members of their par ents' generation. Even Play boy, the one indispensable magazine of college‐age youth in the United States, is little noted in Denmark. Young Danes have told me that they regard it as hopelessly der riere‐garde. ALTHOUGH it appears to be the consensus of Den mark's psychiatrists, sociolo gists, teachers and even cler gymen and police officials that the consequences of ending the ban on pornogra phy and the liberalization of other aspects of the tradi tional moral code cannot pos sibly be as harmful as the continuation of repression, it is not at all certain that the man in the street agrees. Sev eral of the experts I spoke to said that they doubted wheth er the freeing of pornography would have been approved if it had been submitted to a national referendum.

he country as a whole, but among the young, and in Copenhagen, where a quarter of Denmark's people live, it does not appear to be the case. In questioning scores of casual acquaintances, twice at parties, I found no one who would at any rate admit to opposing the lifting of the prohibition on pornography. For that matter, I found no one who would admit having attended the sex fair or having visited a porno shop. A typical reply was, “Oh, it's all right for lonely people who need that sort of thing, but I [or “we” in the case of a couple, often accompanied by a nudge and a wink] don't.” Indeed, there seems to be something self‐limiting about sexual freedom. With so much of the tension removed from the subject, it seems to be dis cussed less than in similar cir cumstances in New York. (In the same way, I found that hard ‐ core pornography and even the sexual exhibitions that are staged in Copen hagen rapidly lost their pow er of excitation.) Time and again I tried to steer the con versation around to good old sex — most Danes speak at least some English and a good many speak it fluently—only to have it steered right back to such familiar topics as the raising of children, the war in Vietnam and the impossibility of finding a large enough apartment. THERE is no way of really knowing whether the Danes are doers rather than talkers. The men I talked to assured me naturally enough, that they were. Everybody, I was led to believe, was having an affair, except, of course, the wife of the man I happened to be talking to. “After all, adultery isn't the physical act, its a state of mind,” one man told me solemnly, apparently unaware that husbands have been trying to convince their wives of this down through history. Sexual freedom didn't seem to worry many of the people I talked to. Everyone, laymen and experts alike, agreed that pornography would run out of customers in Denmark in 10 years, being succeeded per haps by a freer use of erotic themes in the fine arts and on the stage. “rd rather have a good‐looking girl than all the pornography ever made— and I get them,” a young en gineer told me. Young women I spoke to said that sexual freedom gave them more control over their love lives, since they were free to pick and choose and were less likely to regard themselves as the emotional property of the first boy they slept with. The young men said that they could no long er be bewitched by a pretty face, a well‐developed bosom or, for that matter, the grant ing of a sexual favor long de layed. Both young men and women said that having scaled the Mount Everest of sex it was possible to seek out the more enduring, but possibly less obvious, qualities in a future mate — responsiveness, sensitivity," an inquiring mind and good humor. ■""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
COUNCIL STUDYING TEEN‐AGE PARENTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/02/08/archives/council-studying-teenage-parents-social-attitude-and-reforms.html,"“The people at the school used to attend will all know I've had the baby. I don't care where I go because I just want to learn, but I can't put up with their attitudes and their snide comments so I'm not going back to school.”  The young, unmarried preg nant girl was addressing workshop during an all‐day conference last week on the problems of teen‐age parents. The workshop was sponsored by the Community Council of Greater New York at the Brotherhood‐in‐Action Building, 560 Seventh Avenue. More than 400 educators, social workers and community representatives attended the conference and, at the end of the, day, drew up a list of rec ommendations to be acted on by a special committee of the Community Council. These recommendations in elude counseling and assistance for unmarried fathers, a more effective program of sex edu cation in the school system, better day‐care facilities for the children of unmarried pa rents and reform of the abortion law. Social Attitude a Problem But the statement of the pregnant girl who was not go ing back to school seemed to be the recurring theme of the conference—that society had to change its attitude toward both married and unmarried teen‐age parents. “We are confronting a very different world today,” said Mrs. Patricia Garland Morisey, associate professor of the Schoolv of Social Service at Fordham University. “I wonder whether the teen‐agers we are confronting are the problem or whether we are the problems ourselves.” Mrs. Morisey spoke strongly in favor of a more liberalized abortion law so abortion could be an alternative in unwanted pregnancies. She cited studies showing that a safer birth control pill could be developed if it did not have to be guaran teed as foolproof as well, but that such a pill would not be produced unless there was some sort of backup system, such as abortion, when the oral contraceptive failed. Another attitude that was challenged was that babies born out of wedlock were unwanted babies. A number of social workers testified that not only did the mothers want to keep their babies but that unmarried fathers were also very concerned about what happened to the children. Schools More Liberal “If you're child‐centered, you believe in people,” said Mrs. Morisey. “How can you tell a, girl that she should give up something that's part of the family just because you don't like the way it started?” Daniel Schreiber, assistant superintendent of schools, said that Board of Education policy allowed an unmarried pregnant girl to continue in school as long as her “physical and emo tional condition” permitted it. years ago, students were dis charged as soon as they were found to be pregnant. There are now six special schools for unmarried girls who are pregnant. The Board of Education has requested 14 more. After the conference, more than 75 persons signed up to be on the Community Council's special committee to study these recommendations. “We have been here all day,” said Frank Donnelly, super visor of the Windham Chil dren's Service. “There are a lot of people who are using up lot of tax dollars and private money to be here. We have spent an entire day talking to each other and our major rec ommendation is to adopt an action committee and to report back to us in a year.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TV: ‘Day Before Sunday’,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/02/10/archives/tv-day-before-sunday-uta-hagen-struggles-with-thin-story-in.html,"THE talents of Uta Hagen, who has taught her full share of young people the in tricacies of the acting craft, are the redeeming feature of “The Day Before Sunday,” which the Columbia Broad casting System Playhouse will present at 9:30 P.M. today. The original play by Robert Crean is soap opera after the sun has gone down, and it falls upon Miss Hagen to try to give a measure of sub stance and coherence to an inferior work. “The Day Before Sunday,” seen in preview, has a worth while central objective: A portrait of a successful wom an over 40 who yearns for a lover of her own and refuses to sink to the level of a tart. In compensation for her fun damental loneliness she takes to overmanaging the lives of avaricious relatives, only to be rewarded with a determin ation by the younger genera tion to do things its own way. For her, it is a goal arriving too late in life to be realized, albeit she cherishes an ankh, a neck chain symbolizing true individuality of action, which is accidentally left in her room by a contemporary seeking a passing affair. • The trouble with “The Day Before Sunday” is that it is a jumble of contrived drama turgy with a paucity of sup porting characterizations that ring true. Miss Hagen plays Annamae, who has been suc cessful in running a dress shop in Tulsa, Okla., and is a target for unremitting chisel ing by her sister's family. Her niece, whose gradua tion she comes East to at tend, first asks for $1,000 to enable her husband to pay for an abortion for another girl he had gotten in trouble. In turn, Annamae's sister says her husband has dissi pated two semesters of tuition costs, and a further “loan” will be necessary to assure the niece's graduation. Mr. Crean never explains how or why the husband, prac tically a nonexistent part played by Farley Granger, is such a weak heel and sponger. The scenes with Annamae's sister, played by Jacqueline Scott, are almost embarras sing in their overdrawn and predictable emotionalism. • By coincidence Annamae travels East on the same plane with the father of a boy who is graduating from the same school, a part hardly posing much of a chal lenge to the able Martin Bal sam. He is a man to whom she is both attracted and re pelled, as he dons mod dress to keep up with his son. In the tangle of plots and subplots, which could be ef fortlessly sliced into short segments for an afternoon serial. Mr. Crean's lines fall short of any distinction. And back home in Tulsa Annamae is sole support of a senile sister doomed to life in a wheelchair. Mr. Crean, in short, pulled out all the stops so that C.B.S. Playhouse presumably might snag at night some of the addicts of the daytime soaps. Nonetheless, Miss Hagen is interesting to see as the talk ative woman who drinks a little too much and mixes bitterness and compassion over her life's lot. Mr. Crean might have had a genuine play if he had, developed more fully the perils of one person managing the lives of others, but he never really dug into the point and left Miss Hagen to carry very nearly an in tolerable burden, one that at times even defied her own sense of craft discipline. Paul Bogart, producer and director, did what he could with the thin material at his disposal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
City's High School Newspapers Face Extinction as Funds Drop,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/02/10/archives/citys-high-school-newspapers-face-extinction-as-funds-drop-some.html,"New York City's 91 high school student newspapers are in serious financial trouble and some of their faculty advisers predict that within a year many will be out of business unless outside assistance is forthcom ins. Most of the student papers, many of which used to publish monthly, have abandoned any hope of appearing regularly. They are now printed sporadi cally—when enough money has been scraped together from di verse sources. The money problem is so serious for some that the stu dent attempt to spread school news is often reduced to hand ing out typewritten mimeogra phed sheets or making brief announcements on the school's public‐address system. “The papers are just falling apart,” said George Castka, the Board of Education's assistant administrative director in charge of high‐school student affairs. “Generally speaking, all of our papers are in bad finan cial shape.” Decline of the G.O. The decline is traceable to the waning fortunes of the Gen eral Organization system, long the primary source of financial support of student newspapers and other extracurricular ac tivities in the city high schools. Traditionally, the G.O.'s have supported the papers out of an nual dues of a few dollars a student, with the Board of Edu cation paying nothing. In recent years, however, the number of students paying their dues for an annual G. O. mem bership card has fallen sharply. “Kids are awfully sophisti cated today,” said Mrs. Rhyna Goldsmith, a teacher at Flush ing High School, “and having school spirit goes with the past.” “The G. O. symbolizes the establishment.” said Kenneth Krukis co‐editor of The Rich man News at Julia Richman High School. “The kids don't join because the G.O. just doesn't seem relevant.” Mr. Castka said that most schools had 90 per cent mem bership in the G.O. 20 years ago, but now few have more than 50 per cent and some have less than 10 per cent. Rummage Sale Helped The result is a tight squeeze on money available to the school papers. The $2,400 budg et of one paper for example, has been cut to $800 and the paper comes out irregularly. At Julia Richman, enthusi astic student editors held a rummage sale in December to sell Christmas cards and their old jewelry, books and toys. With that $70 plus a $100 con tribution from their adviser, Mrs. Anne Kirsch, and a G. O. contribution, the students hope —by late spring—to have the $400 to $500 needed to print their first issue since last fall. Formerly the paper published monthly. Since September it has been printed only twice, and single mimeographed sheets, run off free on school machines, have been distributed between printed issues. At Franklin K. Lane High School in Brooklyn, The Lane Reporter has been mimeo graphed four times this year. Student editors, who have taken to soliciting contributions from parents and corporations, hope to have their first printed paper soon. The Liberty Bell, at Thomas Jefferson High, also in Brooklyn sought outside contributions to finance its one issue last term. Ads Fall Off The Clinton News at DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx has several times come close to insolvency, according to the paper's adviser, Miss Ada Chines. The editors' en thusiasm, however, has never waned, she added. With their transient staffs, the high‐school newspapers, which began in the city around 1900, have always been shoe string financial operations. A few papers used to rely on advertising, but advertising agencies say the lack of proper business procedures on the part of many student editors dis couraged clients, and the business has declined dras tically. With rising costs and de clining G. O. membership, the papers' financial situation has deteriorated especially in the past year. As a consequence there has been increased pressure for the Board of Education to take over financing the papers and other extracurricular activities. The board's budget proposal for 1970–71 contains a provision for $300,000 for such an undertaking. ‘Drop in the Bucket’ Mr. Castka said that was “a drop in the bucket, but at least it's a start. He added: “We want all our students to be full school citizens without any of this dues business.” Few teachers or students be little the importance of a vi brant student paper, both as a means of communication among the faculty, students and ad ministration and as a practical lesson in writing, self‐expres sion and journalism. Meanwhile, in those papers that are published, there has been a distinct change in con tent. Observers have noted a striking shift away from foot ball scores, beauty queens and prom notes to more serious subjects. The Forum at Flushing High School, for instance, has stopped printing columns on humor, student hobbies and Flushing's history to provide more space for articles on drug addiction. “The kids today are more in terested in Vietnam, drugs and politics,” said Charles O'Malley, director of the 1,500‐member Columbia Scholastic Press Asso ciation, which monitors student journalism across the country. Some Go ‘Underground’ The shift in content has caused some tension between student editors and their facul ty advisers who pass judgment on articles before they go to the printers. Some editors objected to “guidance” provided by ad visers who might hesitate at the vigor of an editorial or anti administration tone of a news article. Some of these disillusioned student journalists resigned last year to found “underground” publications as competition. These papers specialized in service articles, advising stu dents, for example, where to go for draft counseling or birth control and abortion informa tion. Many, however, appeared only a few times before going out of business.. In interviews this year, high school editors expressed little concern about censorship. “Sure, she reads every word,” one 17‐year‐old editor said of her adviser, “but we can handle her.” Many student papers, includ ing Flashing High's Forum, made an effort to recruit “un derground” student journalists for their own staffs. The result, they said, was a more exciting newspaper. Officials at the Board of Edu cation said they hoped to foster such student diversity through a proposed student bill of rights to be discussed at a public hearing Feb. 26. One of its provisions reads: “Official school publications shall reflect the policy and judgment of the student edi tors.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anti‐Abortion Law Gains in Hawaii,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/02/11/archives/antiabortion-law-gains-in-hawaii.html,"HONOLULU, Feb. 10—The Hawaii Senate voted 17 to 7 tonight to repeal a 100‐year‐ old law against abortion.  If the House of Representa tives also approves the bill, it could make Hawaii the first state in the nation to wipe out criminal penalties for abortion. It would also make it possi ble for any woman in the state to permit an abortion by a licensed physician under proper medical conditions. Indications now are that the House will pass the bill. The House leadership is pressing for early action, which could mean passage of the bill within two weeks, depending upon agree ment by a joint conference committee. Advocates of repeal beat down a last‐ditch effort by Republicans, led by the Senate minority leader, B. Hebden Porteus, to water down the bill. The Democratic ‐ dominated Senate ignored a determined effort by Roman Catholic clergymen and church members to prevent the repeal of the abortion law. About 1,000 op ponents of the bill, led by the Most Rev. John J. Scanlan, Bishop of Honolulu, staged a mass demonstration at the state capitol yesterday in an attempt to halt passage of the repeal bill. Had Union Support However, the Democrats let it be known even before the current session began Jan. 21 that they would press for re peal. They had the support of most of Hawaii's labor unions. support of most of Hawaii's labor unions. Senator Vincent Yano, who led the forces seeking repeal of the law in the upper house, is a stanch Catholic. But he said he would not attempt to impose his religious beliefs on those who advocated repeal. Gov. John A. Burns, who is also a Catholic, virtually as sured victory to the repeal forces by letting the word get around that he believed abor tion should be a matter of in dividual conscience. He also made it known that while he would not sign a repeal bill, he would not veto it. This would permit a bill passed by both houses to become law without his signature. The principal opposition to repeal now is expected to come from the House Health Com mittee headed by Representa tive George Loo. Mr. Loo has vowed to fight against repeal and will seek an amended ver sion that would make Hawaii's abortion law similar to that of Colorado, which imposes cer tain restrictions. Although Mr. Loo is a Demo crat and the Democrats hold majority in both houses, the leadership is expected to press for complete abolition of the abortion law. Statistics prepared by the Democratic majority and pre sented during hearings showed that an average of eight abor tions a day are performed ille gally in Hawaii now. The Senate hearings, which were conducted last week, were charged with emotion. They lasted 10 hours and involved more than 65 witnesses. Catholics, who are the largest religious group in the Hawaiian Islands, led the opposition. The main brunt of their argument was that the human fetus was an “innocent person and en titled to live.” This position was emphasized by the Rev. Francis Marzen, editor of The Catholic Herald, a weekly, and spokes man for the Catholic diocese. Colorado Law Eased In 1967, Colorado became the first state to relax its anti abortion law. No state now al lows “abortion on demand.” Under the new Colorado law, abortion may be performed by a licensed physician in a repu table hospital if the mental or physical health of the mother or that of her unborn child is endangered or if the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest. The key change was the ac ceptance of psychiatric condi tions as a reason for abortion. Judge Gerhard A. Gessell of the United States District Court in Washington, D. C., struck down a local law last November that prohibited doc tors from performing abortions except when the expectant mother's health or life was in danger. The decision said that the law was too vague to be con stitutional and that it inter fered with doctor‐patient pri vacy, thus possibly setting the stage for a ruling on the ques tion by the United State Su preme Court. Last week, the Justice De partment urged the Supreme Court to overturn Judge Ges sell's ruling because in effect, it authorized physicians to per form abortions “for any reason whatsoever.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BILL ON ABORTIONS STUDIED IN HAWAII,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/02/12/archives/bill-on-abortions-studied-in-hawaii.html,"HONOLULU, Feb. 11 (AP)— A bill repealing the state's abortion laws was referred to day to a Senate‐House confer ence committee. The bill, which originated in the House last year, was amended in the Senate to call for outright repeal. The House version only liberalized the abortion law. The House unanimously voted down the Senate's repeal amendment to permit the meas ure to be submitted to the con ference committee which will work out a compromise. There was no indication what action the committee would take on the measure. Senators passed the amended bill last night by a 17‐to‐7 vote. Gov. John A. Burns, a Roman Catholic, said earlier that if the bill passed both houses he would not veto it but would let it become law without his sig nature. Hawaii's present 101‐year‐old law permits abortion only when the mother's life is in danger.

Pregnancies Follow Birth Pill Publicity,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/02/15/archives/pregnancies-follow-birth-pill-publicity.html,"Doctors across the country say they are beginning to see the first round of unwanted pregnancies among women who stopped using birth control pills after adverse publicity in the last few months. “I'm now looking for some one to abort a 14‐year‐old who panicked,” said a New York obstetrician who specializes in family planning among the poor. Another New York physician, a Park Avenue obstetrician, said a patient of his who dropped the pill after reading a “scare report” is in London this weekend to get an abor tion. In California, Dr. R. Elgin Orcutt, president of the San Francisco Planned Parenthood Association, reports that “many are coming in for therapeutic abortions, many are going to England and many others are getting criminal abortions.” These women, who stopped the pill in a panic and are now trying to deal with an unwant ed pregnancy, are experiencing “the most serious side effect,” Dr. Orcutt remarked. Dr. Orcutt and about a score of other birth control experts interviewed last week said that they expect the number of un wanted pregnancies to soar in the next few weeks and months among women who have re cently given up the pill in fa vor of less effective contracep tive methods and, in some cases, no contraception at all. “We regularly see a crlop of unwanted pregnancies—a dis turbing number of them—after each batch of bad publicity,” commented Dr. Selig Neubardt, a New Rochelle obstetrician who is the author of “A Con cept of Contraception,” a pop ular book on family planning. A Gallup poll taken during the first week of this month for Newsweek magazine, re vealed that largely because of recent reports of suspected health hazards, 18 per cent of women have stopped taking the pill and 23 per cent more said that they were giving serious consideration to doing so. Most of the adverse reports on the pill grew out of the Sen ate hearings on oral contracep tives held last month by the monopoly subcommittee of Sen ator Gaylord Nelson, Democrat of Wisconsin. Testimony at the hearings linked the pill to a long list of disorders, including blood clots, strokes, heart attacks, diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer and arthritis. Many physicians in the fam ily‐planning field have charged that the hearings were heavily stacked in favor of pill critics who overemphasized health hazards that are at best spec ulative. Just prior to the hear ings, the long‐simmering debate about the pill's safety became intensified with the publication of several books and lay articles and the presentation of broad casts proclaiming the pill to be dangerous. Some Reactions to Reports “Unfortunately,” Dr. Orcutt said, “many women who heard and read these reports stopped the pill without calling their doctors and without using any other form of contraception.” Interviews with obstetricians in various parts of the country disclosed that, of the women who did call their doctors, many decided to stay with the pill after being told that the Senate hearings had produced no new evidence of health hazards. But a far greater number of women, these physicians said, were so disturbea and upset by the reports that they decided to switch to other methods of contraception. Many doctors reported “a run on diaphragms” and, to lesser extent, on intrauterine devices (IUD's). A check of pharmacies in and around New York disclosed a small but sig nificant increase in the sales of contraceptive foams, jellies and creams and condoms, and a definite falling off in sales of oral contraceptives. Dr. Nathan Chaset, a Provi dence, R. I., urologist, said he has had a tripling in requests for male sterilization procedures (vasectomies) since the Senate hearings. Several doctors interviewed said that the turn away from oral contraceptives would not cause too many problems among middle‐class and upperclass wo men who, for the most part, are highly motivated to use oth er contraceptive methods effec tively and who could support another child or obtain an abor tion should an unwanted con ception occur. “But among clinic patients, who cannot afford another child and cannot back up a contraceptive failure with abor tion, the defection from the pill to less effective methods could be disastrous,” a spokes man for Planned Parenthood of New York said. Dr. Edwin Daily, director of the city's Maternal and Infant Care program, said that the per centage of new patients who requested and received oral contraceptives dropped from 68 per cent in December to 47 per cent during the last week in January. Dr. Daily pointed out that, except for sterilization, the pill is the most effective contracep tive currently available.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Brydges Easing Opposition to New Abortion Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/02/19/archives/brydges-easing-opposition-to-new-abortion-law.html,"ALBANY, Feb. 18 — Senate Majority Leader Earl W. Bryd ges, for years one of the most powerful opponents of abortion reform, indicated today that his stand was easing and that he might support some form of liberalization.  The Niagara Falls Republican told an informal gathering of newsmen that a bill was being drafted by members of his staff that would eliminate some of the personal objections he has to the two major abortion re form bills now pending in the Legislature. He declined to say whether he would vote for the bill, but indicated it would be more palatable to critics of present bills. The bill now being drafted at his request would specify a point during pregnancy beyond which an abortion could not be performed except when the mother's life was threatened. The Senator said he did not agree with a bill sponsored by Assemblyman Constance Cook, Ithaca Republican, who is seek ing repeal of the criminal pen alties for abortion. “What troubles me with that approach,” Mr. Brydges said, “is that it could allow an abor tion of a fetus a day before normal birth would be due at a time when all life functions are normal.” He insisted that his position had to do only with his con cern that abortion reform not allow what would otherwise be considered “murder” of a hu man being. Mr. Brydges also said he could not support the other major reform bill, sponsored by Assemblyman Albert H. Blumen thal, Manhattan Democrat. Mr. Blumenthal's bill would add seven new grounds for abortion to the present law, which permits abortion only to save the mother's life. Mr. Blumenthal's bill was rejected in the Assembly last year after long and emotional debate. He is renewing efforts to pass it this year although he is supporting Mrs. Cook's bill in preference to his own. “I don't know,” Mr. Brydges said at one point. “Perhaps I should accept the position of the militant women who say they should be able to do any thing they want to with their bodies but I just can't accept that view of society. They want an infallible contracep tive, and I can't accept that.” Both Governor Rockefeller and Assembly Speaker Perry B. Duryea have announced support for some reform of the abortion law, which dates from 1828. Although Mr. Brydges in sisted he would only “wait and look” at the new bill, the fact that it is being drafted by members of his staff to meet. objections he has to existing bills adds support to a general feeling that support for some reform is growing among legis lators this session.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41 DRUG SUSPECTS ARRAIGNED IN DAY,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/02/20/archives/41-drug-suspects-arraigned-in-day-judge-in-brooklyn-assails.html,"Forty‐one young men and women were arraigned on nar cotics charges yesterday in State Supreme Court in Brook lyn. The figure set a record for the number of narcotics suspects arraigned there in one day.  The suspects, who ranged in age from 19 to the middle 20's, appeared in the ninth‐floor courtroom before Justice John R. Starkey. The charges in cluded sales and possession of heroin, marijuana and bar biturates. All the defendants pleaded not guilty. Justice Starkey re leased several in their own custody for hearings because they had no previous arrest records, but he held the others in bail ranging from $500 to $3,500 When a clerk called the court's attention to the fact that 41 of the criminal calen dar's 46 cases were related to narcotics violations — the re maining cases dealt with at tempted burglary, assault with a weapon and abortion—Jus tice Starkey shook his head and said: “This is a horrible and fright ening situation. This is a creep ing epidemic which is infecting our society.” Between Feb. 11 and yester day, there were 127 narcotics cases — all felonies — in the court, charging possession with intent to sell, or actual sales. This was more than twice that of the non‐narcotics cases, which totaled 59. Justice Starkey fixed no trial dates in yesterday's cases. The defendants are being prosecut ed by Martin Hershey, chief of the narcotics bureau under District Attorney Eugene Gold of Kings County. Mr. Gold noted that there was “almost daily a tremen dous increase of narcotics ar rests in Brooklyn,” especially by young people, is increasing at a terrifying rate,” he said. While he did not have sta tistics immediately available the District Attorney reported that the number of narcotic arrests last year was almost double that of 1968.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Goldwater Hails Young People, Agrees With ‘Much’ of New Left",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/02/21/archives/goldwater-hails-young-people-agrees-with-much-of-new-left.html,"Senator Barry M. Goldwa ter told a college audience here yesterday that the current gen eration of young people was the best he had ever known. “I'm very, very impressed with the young people in our country,” the former Republi can Presidential candidate said at Mills College of Education, at 66 Fifth Avenue, near 12th Street. Mr. Goldwater, known as a champion of conservatism, said that he found himself “in sub stantial agreement with much of the New Left” but that he rejected violent tactics. “Doing your own thing is one thing,” he said, “but hurt ing someone else or destroying property is wrong.” The Arizona Senator ad dressed an attentive audience of 200, most of them young women, who crowded into the second‐floor auditorium of the college, which trains teachers for young children. “I'd sure like to have you ask questions,” Mr. Goldwater said after he had spoken for a few minutes. “I can find out what's on your mind, and you can find out if I have one.” In reply to numerous ques tions, he said he favored win ning the war in Vietnam, legal izing abortion, passing a nega tive income tax, punishing the Chicago 7 for their court con duct, sending planes to Israel, electing President Nixon to a second term and then electing Vice President Agnew as Presi dent. He expressed opposition to the draft, sit‐ins, centralized government, subpoenas for newsmen, drugs and present drug laws. When a reporter asked about Mayor Lindsay as a Presidential possibility, Mr. Goldwater held out little hope. “If we do our job,” he said, “we'll have two terms of Nixon and two terms of Agnew and by that time Mr. Lindsay will be up around 70. He still might be good‐looking but would be kind of old for that track.” A woman In the audience rose to tell Mr. Goldwater that she was a hawk on Vietnam but that her daughter was a dove and that she needed ad vice. The Senator said, “This is a real problem.” The session's longest ap plause was evoked by a wo man who asked what path young people could take when the President ignored their peace demonstrations. Peaceful petition was the Senator's ad vice. The loudest laughter came when Mr. Goldwater addressed a long‐haired questioner as “the girl in the blue sweater” and was promptly informed “it's not a girl.” The Senator appolo gized, saying the television lights had been in his eyes. As he left after answering an hour of questions, he was approached by Audrey Stier, a Mills senior, who requested an autograph for her father. “Although I'm not a great fan of yours,” she said, “my parents adore you.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Birth Control Without The Pill,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/02/22/archives/birth-control-without-the-pill.html,"The relative effectiveness of various contraceptive techniques has become a matter of press ing concern in family‐planning circles as women drop “the pill” in response to recent publicity regarding its alleged health haz ards. Most of these adverse reports came out of Senator Gaylord Nelson's Senate hearings last month, at which critics of birth control pills outnumbered pro ponents seven to one. Critics linked the pill to a host of dis eases, including blood clots, heart disease, cancer and dia betes. Polls indicate that 18 per cent of pill users—or about 1.7 mil lion women—have dropped the pill as a result of these adverse reports. Statistics from family planning clinics that serve the poor corroborate the poll find ings: Following the hearings, there was a 15 to 30 per cent decline in pill use among clinic patients. Several family‐planning ex perts, noting that the pill is their most effective weapon against unwanted pregnancies, predicted that at least 100,000 such preg nancies will occur in the next few months among those women who abandoned the pill for other methods of contraception. “These women will be ex periencing the most serious side effect,” says Dr. R. Elgin Orcutt, president of the San Francisco Planned Parenthood Association. According to United States mor tality statistics, 100,000 preg nancies would result in about 25 maternal deaths—eight times the death rate associated with the pill from blood‐clotting dis orders, the only well‐established lethal hazard of the pill. Of those women who terminate their unwanted pregnancies through illegal abortion, one in 1,000 would die. The prediction of 100,000 un wanted pregnancies is based upon the known failure rate of various other methods of con traception. These statistics have been summarized by Dr. Chris topher Tietze of the Population Council, who is an international authority on the effectiveness of contraception. According to Dr. Tietze, the pregnancy rate among women who take the combined type of oral contraceptive is one for every 1,000 women a year if they never miss a pill. (For the sequentials the comparable rate is five for each 1,000 women year.) Even with the omission of one or more pills during the month, the pregnancy rate is only seven for the combined type and 14 for the sequentials. The pill's main advantage as a contraceptive technique, aside from its extreme effectiveness, is that its use is unrelated to the sexual act. The only other contraceptive method with the same level of effectiveness is sterilization, a permanent con traceptive and thus not suitable for women who want future children. Even this method has a failure rate of .20 to .05 preg nancies for each 1,000 women a year. A check with a score of ob stetricians across the country last week revealed that most women who are dropping the pill are choosing instead the in trauterine device (IUD) or the diaphragm. Use of IUD is also unrelated to the sexual act and relies even less than the pill upon the motivation and intelligence of the user. But it has a consid erably higher failure rate than the pill—about 20 to 30 preg nancies for each 1,000 women year. The diaphragm, if used con sistently with a spermicidal jelly or cream, is as effective as the IUD. But in clinic populations, it often has a failure rate of 100 to 300 pregnancies for each 1,000 women a year, largely due to “taking a chance.” Dr. Tietze says with regard to “taking a chance” that the “risk of pregnancy associated with a single unprotected coitus, enjoyed at random during the menstrual cycle, is on the order of 2 to 4 per cent.” Temperature rhythm, if prac ticed consistently, Dr. Tietze says, can be as effective as the IUD and perhaps the pill, but the hooker is “if practiced consis tently.” It requires a long pe riod of abstinence—from men struation to two days after ovul ation as indicated by the basal body temperature taken every morning upon arising. Regular use of the condom is also a 97 to 98 per cent effec tive contraceptive technique, Dr. Tietze reports. (In the United States, 997 out of 1,000 condoms tested are free from defect.) But again, too many couples who use the condom tend to “take a chance,” with a resulting failure rate of 6 to 20 per cent. According to Dr. Tietze, chem ical barriers—spermicides in the form of foams, jellies, creams, suppositories and foaming tab lets—are generally less effective when used alone than when in combination with a diaphragm. Calendar rhythm, which re lies on a calculation of “unsafe days” based upon the woman's shortest and longest menstrual cycles over a year's time, re quires a shorter period of ab stinence than temperature rhythm. But it fails about 20 per cent of the time, largely because of miscalculations and cycle irregularities. Withdrawal prior to ejacula tion can be highly effective among couples who have estab lished that they can use it pro perly. But, on a mass scale, it has a failure rate of 12 to 38 per cent. Douche following sexual inter course is notoriously ineffective as a contraceptive because sperm can reach the cervical canal—where the douche can not get at them—within 90 sec onds of ejaculation. Dr. Tietze says that douche should be used only as a back‐up method, such as when a condom breaks. Despite the problems with other contraceptive techniques, Dr. Selig Neubardt, a New Rochelle obstetrician who has written widely on contraception, says that even “if the pill were withdrawn from the market to day, we'd be in a lot better shape than we were 10 years ago.” He explained that the pill has given many women “an appetite for contraception,” and has shown women who previously thought that “contraception was for other people” that it can work for them too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This ‘Road’ Is A Dead End,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/02/22/archives/this-road-is-a-dead-end-end-of-the-road-and-tropic-of-cancer.html,"TWO films based on nota ble novels have recent ly opened: “End of the Road,” derived from John Barth's second, and probably best, novel, “The End of the Road”; and “Tropic of Cancer,” adapted from Henry Miller's fictionalized autobiography, possibly the favorite forbidden book of yesteryear. “End of the Road,” from which a great deal more of Barth than the initial article has been slashed, is based on a novel that ends with a har rowing abortion. The film goes the book one better, by being an abortion from be ginning to end. I don't know who the main culprit is: Aram Avakian, the former film edi tor newly turned director, or one or all of the scenarists, Dennis McGuire, Terry South ern and Avakian himself. The name that sticks out sinisterly from this line‐up is that of Terry Southern, the novelist‐scenarist who, con sidering his slender and un wholesbme talent, has been able to make a mountain out of a dunghill. Though his ear liest fiction contained sonic promisingly rampaging row diness, this vest‐pocket Rabe lais never laid open vistas wider than an unzipped fly. His most successful book, “Candy,” was, in fact, a col laboration, and revealed, on closer inspection, small con trol of humor, style, or even English grammar. It was again a collabora tion, the sort of thing for which the least silent partner ends up getting most of the credit, that brought Southern into the scriptwriting lime light. This was the delightful “Dr. Strangelove,” a tripar tite screenwriting credit, for which Southern managed to corral almost as much praise as Stanley Kubrick, the prin cipal writer as well as direc tor of the film. From there, Southern went on to butcher, with admirable impartiality, whatever came his way to be adapted: the good, like Eve lyn Waugh's novella, “The Loved One”; the bad, like the comic strip, “Barbarella”; or the in‐between, like his own early novelette, “The Magic Christian.” (This last, which just arrived here, is as in ept and piggish a film as “Futz” of unlamented mem ory.) Southern keeps franti cally stretching his minuscule means, only making the same thing bigger, weirder, cruder and, above all, more scato “The End of the Road,” the novel, was a comedy of col lege life in the fifties, a satire on psychotherapy, and a per sonal tragedy. The film sets out to be absurdist farce, gobs of black humor, and, most of all, as “Now” as all get‐out. It begins, accordingly, with a montage of stock‐shots, in cluding, among other things, Hitler, concentration camps, Mussolini and mistress hanged upside‐down, atom‐bomb ex plosions, Harry Truman, launchings at Cape Kennedy, the assassination of JFK, LBJ and the beagle, Dr. King's funeral, the Saigon police chief executing at point‐blank range, other Vietnam execu tions, Nixon, Jasper Johns‐ish close‐ups of the Stars and Stripes, the Chicago riots— all this interspersed with sweet, burbling babies. It is flanked by shots of a college that violent demonstration. On the sound track, as Jacob Horner, the disaffected hero, walks di rectly from graduation into catatonia, we hear Billie Hol iday singing “Don't Worry Bout Me,” for a bit of easy irony. This is supposed to provide, in a nutshell, justi fication for the problems of Horner, America, humanity, and the scriptwriters. For every outlandish, demented, and, yes, swinish spectacle on the screen is to be taken as sufficiently justified by these references. There is hardly a love scene, a psychiatric ses sion, a daydream, with out these portentous al lusions being reintroduced in a fashionable, facile and fatu ous Dance of Death. (Rule of thumb: a film containing li brary shots of either concen tration camps or atomic ex plosions will be almost cer tainly bad; a film containing both, certainly.) But every kind of grossness proliferates in the film. In the book, Jake Horner is treated by a pre posterous psychiatrist. In the film, the Doctor becomes a menacing black man, by turns a militant, a buffoon, a guru, an Uncle Tom, a primi tive Bushman, an image of stern or cackling omniscience and invincibility. As James Earl Jones plays him (horri bly, in both senses of the word), he keeps shifting ac cents—as, indeed, does al most everyone else in the movie, the scenarists evident ly considering this a capital jest —sometimes turning his mouth into an obscene snout, and squealing, grunting, trympeting his lines. * The Doctor's sanatorium is, for tht, outdoorsy patients, nonstop orgy on the front lawn and in the surrounding bushes; for indoor lunatics, it is the fulfillment of fantasies in which they can enact pun ished schoolboys, dogs, snip ers, or, in the case of one particularly imaginative male patient, a masked, gagged and crucified ballerina. A nurse, described by Barth as “a large, masculine woman,” becomes here a‐ scowling, hir sute man in drag, outfitted with an untidy gray wig. A reference in the book to the possible passes the male pa tients might make at Homer, becomes in the film a light ning homosexual rape per formed on Horner as he is fol lowing the Doctor down a staircase, while the latter con tinues his insouciant descent, spouting metaphysical, or metapsychiatric, cant. A par ticularly jolly scene has one naked patient, by way of “mythotherapy,” copulat ing with a chicken (Leda and the hen?), raising once again the age‐old question of which comes first, the chicken or the ech? If, in such matters, the hand of Terry Southern is stranglingly recognizable, there are other offenses for which the director must be blamed, Avakian has gotten from the skillful Gordon Wil lis color cinematography that is exceedingly artful and thor oughly cloying. A forest into which ride Jacob and Rennie, the wife of his teacher‐friend soon to become his mistress, is made into an enormous goo of turquoise and pistachio, from which the strongest eye gets indigestion. A sanatori um room is all white, with only snatches of brown and black obtruding on it, so that the color film is artily aping black‐and‐white photography. A body of water deliquesces into tiny, fragmented, silvery wavelets, which, in turn, change into bubbles bursting into a pristine blank screen. Two people descending winding outdoor staircase are not only burnished by the sunset to every shade from amber to terra cotta, but also shown both approaching and moving away from the camera in a long, schizoid superimposition. A pair of horsemen, riding from left to right, meet themselves, super imposed and doppelganger like, riding from right to left, the whole thing super imposed yet again, in an ach ingly slow dissolve, over sparkling waves of a lake that gradually inundate the riders. For no reason at all, every thing stops while we watch flies in extreme close‐up climbing up a window pane or disporting themselves on a light fixture. Out of nowhere, distorting lenses are conjured up to knead the image into funhouse‐mirror disten tions. When the film is not projected in triplicate, the ac tors turn into plasticene. The camera angles and move ments are often as bizarre as if the camera were mounted on a drunken pogo stick. The musical score, arranged by the director's brother, George, is condignly turgid and pretentious. It totters from Teo Macero's banal symphonic jazz into Bach played (I think) on a Moog synthesizer; thence it back tracks into jazz, or, for the crucified transvestite balle rina, leaps into “Swan Lake.” But another relative of the director's, his wife, Dorothy Tristan, turns nepotism into inspiration. The actress can make her pleasant but unre markable face into a doz en different faces: beautiful, pain‐riddled, childlike, wiz ened, otherworldly, furibund, ethereal, earth‐motherish you name it—and even un namable, Now she is the pro totypical dowdy faculty wife, now a blazing maenad un leashed on our libido; now a china shepherdess so fragile her own breathing might shat ter her, now a goddess shoot ing up high above any mere man in the immensity of her love or wrath. Aram Avaki an's dreadful “End of the Road” should perhaps be shiningly irrefutable perform ance that triumphs over sabotaging script and frac turing photography. The director of “Tropic of Cancer,” Joseph Strick, has a distinguished record of turn ing his attention only to gen uine works of art and con sistently botching them. Ge net's “The Balcony” and Joyce's “Ulysses” had to bear the brunt of his high‐minded amateurishness, and emerged from his hands as Stricken deer. Though a lesser work, “Tropic of Cancer” is an im portant novel in two ways: as a torrentially lyrical outpour ing of Miller's sometimes in spired, sometimes merely gar rulous lust for life, lust for art, lust for lust; and as a documentary of the American “lost generation” in Paris in the twenties and thirties —their scrounging, hustling, loafing and strangely symbi otic kind of parasitism. As George Orwell correctly not ed, the book's importance is “symptomatic.” Strick has managed to lose the second characteris tic completely. By up‐dating the film—not so much to make it “Now” as simply to save money—he has cast his characters into a flabby lim bo, lacking even the firm un reality of Ruritania. For this is a recognizable 1969 Paris in which over ‐ age American expatriates rhap sodize schoolboyishly about sexual experiences, people catch boat trains to get back to the States, and Henry Mil ler himself, played by Rip Torn, barely knows three words of French and speaks them as if the phrase‐book had not yet turned cold in his pocket. Moreover, Miller and his motley moochers were all as passionately enamored of literature and art as they were of sex, or of talking about sex (which, better yet, combined sex and literature!); but the people in the film might as well be in the meat packing or undertaking busi ness for all they seem to know or care about the arts. * As for the crazy, lopsided poetry, Strick, co‐scenarist as well as director, tries to hang on to some of it by preserv ing chunks of Miller's mam moth monologues as off screen narration. But, alas, the simplified onscreen dia logue painfully clashes with the flights of voice‐over fancy —as if the film were shot simultaneously in two lan guages: English and basic (or even baser) English. Nor does the narration profit from Rip Torn's delivery, as Texanly monotonous as if the flat side of a cleaver had mercilessly reduced it to its own image. But at least Torn is of a piece, playing Miller equally mono tonously as a beaming, be dazzled goat, leaping about in ecstasy for having discov ered some simple arithmetical fact, such as one plus one equals two, or yin plus yang equals BANG! Nevertheless, the film does, almost accidentally, preserve some of Miller's existential ecstasy, sense of humor and smiling amorality. Never be fore have four‐letter words so deluged us from the screen, never has sex been made more blatant, obsessive and, at the same time, as naively innocent as stamp‐collecting, as amiably competitive as autograph hunters compar ing their albums. Moreover. Strick's device of having the narration wallow in menda cious accounts of gigantic sexual feats while the camera tells the sober and pitiful truth, creates some smartly comic effects—until the joke dies from overuse. Even a lesser conceit, the quickly shifting close‐ups of different parts of feminine anatomy marching, bounding, hurtling at you, prove§ a nice objec tive correlative for a sexual greed starving, like Buridan's ass, amid breasts, bellies, behinds among which it can not choose. In all this, Strick is greatly aided by the ex cellent editing of the late Sidney Meyers and Sylvia Sarner. The acting, by a cast of relative unknowns, is largely unnoteworthy. There are ex ceptions: James Callahan, as Fillmore, captures much of Miller's zany pathos; the de pendable Magali Noel makes a dubious Princess indubita ble fun; and Frangoise Lu gagne is quietly touching as a woman whose age is a deterrent even to dedicated satyrs. The passing parade of adulterous wives, dishonest whores, fun‐loving nympho maniacs and other miscella neous doxies is suitably un glamorous, avid, desperate or indifferent—their clothing as deciduous as autumn leaves, their faces as nakedly weath erbeaten as a winter tree. Two of them are even beauti ful: Sabine Sun as a buxom ly toothsome Teuton and El len Burstyn as Miller's errant wife, bursting out of her dresses or frontally nude enough to reveal that she is no natural redhead. “End of the Road” is a pre tentious, unappetizing disas ter. “Tropic of Cancer,” dis oriented, diminished and (fig uratively even more than lit erally) denuded as it is, still exhibits a skittering vitality, as likable as it is laughable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/02/22/archives/letters.html,"OPERA: THE HURRICANE AND THE MUSIC To THE EDITOR: In observing that I “exposed an unprotected flank” in my criticism of Franco Corelli (“A Champion Tenor Defends His Title,” by William H. Ronan, Feb. 8), Mr. Honan may very well have exposed one of his own. He advances the strange thesis that it is somehow wrong‐headed for an operagoer to expect attention to purely musical values on a night in the opera house, that we should forget about the artistic integrity of Verdi's musical style and concentrate instead on the “gigantic and unruly force” of opera‐as‐hurricane. To de mand a fair shake for the composer, as I am sometimes moved to do, is to “betray a hi‐fi estheticism.” Balder dash. I defer to no listener in my joyous acceptance of the thundering, roaring drama of romantic grand opera, but this doesn't alter my suspicion that its finest composers were musical geniuses as well. And when I come across a singer whose work betrays (to my own way of thinking, na turally) a lack of awareness of that latter fact, I am obliged to say so in print. If Mr. Honan attends the opera merely for the hurricane and not for the music, then he, too, is guilty of half‐listening. I must gracefully decline the as cription of “hi‐fi esthete,” a lovely if meaningless phrase. It is certainly not “hi‐fi estheticism” that inclines me to prefer a Callas to a Sutherland, with all the former's vocal problems, or a tenor who can make me feel that he comes on the stage in the service of great music, rather than vice versa. When I want the hurricane, I sit in front of my electric fan with the motor turned up high; when I want musical excitement, and the drama that stupendously gifted composers have created, I go to the opera house. ALAN RICH, Music Critic. New York magazine. New York. Mr. Honan replies: Dear Electric Fan. Like I said, it's really a matter of emphasis. Your Faithful Servant. HURRICANE. TWO NATIONS IN BRITAIN To THE EDITOR: The “Two Nations at Wesleyan University,” Jan. 18, was thought provoking and well done, but it seemed to me that Richard Margolis was looking at the problem from too close up. He was talking race, and I honestly do not think that this is the big factor in the irritation at Wesleyan and similar universities. The problem is social. Most of the Wesleyan black stu dents are from poor families; they lack social graces and they come to campus inadequately prepared educationally for higher studies. “Most white teachers here don't know how to teach blacks,” senior Dwight Green is quoted as saying. I do not believe the problem to which he refers has anything to do with color. It stems from the teach ers talking over the heads of many of the black students, and this can cause mind‐boggling frustration on both sides. There is little point in trying to teach engineering to some one who has not had the benefit of a sound grounding in basic math. There is also little point in thrusting someone straight out of a ghetto or off a Georgia farm into the Ivy League and expecting him to be immediately at home. The problems would be exactly the same if the new students were white; the fact that they are black merely gives the problem visual identity. I can recall a parallel situation in England. Before World War II, high er education, even at the junior college level, was mainly for the scions of the Establishment, simply because it was expensive. After the war, the 11‐plus examination was introduced. Under this system, a student who attained sufficiently high ??narks automatically entered grammar school, with substantial Government support. Those who paid to attend were thrown out if they could not pass the same examination. (Grammar school, in this context, is not used in the American sense. An English grammar school prepares one for university entrance examina tions.) In any event, the changeover caused quite an upheaval. Boys who would otherwise have gone straight onto the farm from elementary schools suddenly found themselves writing Latin and Greek prose and studying French. They were ridiculed at home for turning “sissy” (Uncle Tomming?) and they were also ridi culed at school for their rough speech and manners. They could not adopt the mannerisms of their new environment because of what they would go through at home, but their speech was an embarrassment at school. They compromised, coming up with a peculiar language all their own—something between dialect and educated speech. This, and the fact that they generally were poorly dressed, set them apart. In the early days, many dropped out and took jobs, passing up the opportunity to go on to university. However, the situation resolved itself in the end, because eventually there were more poor boys than rich boys in the schools. It would not have resolved itself, however, if the boys had been ad mitted for political reasons, rather than by dint of their proven merit. They did not complain that the then rather snobbish teachers could not teach peasants (is the word tabu?) because they had received good ele mentary educations and were pre pared for higher studies. They learned faster, in fact, than their more fortunate schoolmates because they had the motivation; Daddy wouldn't be able to help them in later life. These were white kids, but until they learned how to use knives and forks in an acceptable manner, they set themselves apart in the dining room, too. I think it is time we stopped sim plifying the campus imbroglio as black‐white thing and identified the problem for what it really is: basi cally socio‐economic. JOHN W. DAY. Stamford; Conn. ABORTION DEBATE To THE EDITOR: A right to abortion? (“Constitu tional Question: Is There a Right to Abortion?” by Linda J. Greenhouse, Jan. 25.) What right does any human being have to take another human life? Those who support legal abortion are apparently attempting to cloud the real issue—when is life life and when is life not life? If the unquickened fetus is, as Roy Lucas contends, “just a mass of protoplasm,” would Mr. Lucas be kind enough to explain just when and how the “mass of protoplasm” receives the magic ingredient called human life? Is Mr. Lucas suggesting that the “mass of protoplasm,” before quick ening, could develop into something other than a human being? Is he suggesting that in some miraculous way, yet unknown to science, at the time of quickening the mass acquires a human quality? Isn't it true that the human fetus cannot develop into anything but human being? Isn't it true that the human element is present at the moment of conception? And as hu man life, the fetus has the right to development, growth and maturity, just as the newborn infant has his right. We are seriously deluding our selves if we believe that the life created at the time of conception is anything but human. Because it is human, it is our duty to protect it, not abort it! A right to contraception, yes. Pre vention of pregnancy is a personal matter and our choice to bear chil dren or prevent conception is clearly protected by the Supreme Court's acknowledgment of a “right to pri vacy” or “liberty” in matters related to marriage, family and sex. How ever, once conception takes place, the choice is no longer present. A human life has been started. It is as unthinkable to terminate that life as it is to terminate any other Inman life at any age. (Mrs.) MARJORIE M. KOBBE. Stamford, Conn. • To THE EDITOR: It is interesting that New York State maintains it has a “stake in the unborn child” and must keep and enforce its anti‐abortion law. An unborn child does not need to be protected from adult abuse, does not need wholesome food or proper clothing and does not need the at tention of dentists, pediatricians and teachers. As soon as a child is born and requires these costly necessities for a sound and active mind and body, the state mysteriously relin quishes its responsibility for the life of the child. There is no law in New York State against pregnant women smoking. It is well known that women who smoke during pregnancy have, on the average, smaller babies with higher proportion of mental retarda tion and slow learning. Automobiles continue to kill and injure children both directly by accidents and indi rectly by lead, carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide fumes. These fumes inhibit the learning and thought processes of children more than those of adults. There is evidence that pregnant mammals exposed to low levels of any one of these fumes over a long period of time tend to give birth to mentally deficient young. New York State has a pro gram for the expanded use of nu clear reactors, although it will cause increased radiation exposure to the populace. Pregnant women exposed to low‐level doses of radiation have a higher percentage of deformed or mentally deficient babies than wom en who were not exposed. In all these cases, where is the state's stake in the child? Since this state is not protecting the life or health of its children, either before or after birth, it is obvious that the state is enforcing an oppressive moral code and maxi mizing the misery of the women and children under its jurisdiction. If this law is upheld and enforced, the state must be required to take responsibility for the health and safety of all the children. Each child must have three meals a day, regular medical and dental care, warm cloth ing and protection from abusive parents and drug pushers. Each child must have whatever mental health he needs. DEBORAH SOLOMON, Department of Biology, Columbia University New York. • To THE EDITOR: Ceres, offended by Erysichthon, punished him with an insatiable ap petite. In the end he ate himself. Abortion on demand, neither right nor privilege, but rather man's easy answer to an appetite that he re fuses to control by the rational ap proach—namely, willful discipline— will, as did Erysichthon's punish ment, lead to society's self‐consump tion. Witness Rumania and Bulgaria, where abortion on demand has re sulted in such a low birth rate that government by fiat has reversed itself. Wasn't it Christ who said, “Love thy neighbor as thyself'? Who can tell me that the fetus is not my neighbor on the first day or the last day of its in utero existence? FRANKLIN T. BRAYER, M.D., Director, Center for Population Research,. Georgetown University. Washington, D. C. • To THE EDITOR: I am glad to see the fight for woman's right to abortion taken to the courts because I hope they will be more sympathetic than the legis latures have been. While nature has set a definite limit on how long woman can be pregnant, no one has set a limit on how long it should take for a court to act on‐its cases. It would be convenient if all women could avoid becoming pregnant until the question were settled. If a wom an's timing is not all that precise, I suppose she could count on a decision for a retroactive abortion. (Mrs.) ETHLYN LEHMAN. Trenton, N.

CITY STUDENTS ASK A VOICE ON POLICY,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/02/24/archives/city-students-ask-a-voice-on-policy-high-schools-go-council-adopts.html,"The elected representatives of the city's 275;000 high school students will ask the Board of Education this week to give students a major voice de termining policies and practices in their schools. Adopted last week by the City General Organization Council, the officially recog nized student government body, the proposal has already stirred concern among some school of ficials here. The officials charge that the council's action does not re flect the sentiments of the majority of high‐school stu dents. They also view the pro posal as part of a new campaign by high school and college mili tants to sow discord in the schools. However, Donald Reeves, a 17‐year‐old student at the High School of Music and Art who heads the City G.O. Council, described the proposal as “ne gotiable.” He said that it rep resented an effort by students to detail what they regarded as their constitutional rights and the role they saw for them selves in their schools. Representatives of the City College chapters of the Third World Committee, a largely black and Puerto Rican group, and the Student Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam worked with the high school students who drew up the proposal. A major demand of the G.O. Council calls for the establish ment in each of the city's 91 academic and vocational high schools of a 20‐member “school liaison board” Whose decisions would be “final, absolute and binding” on the principal, teachers and students. Each liaison board would consist of 10 students, four teachers, the prinicpal and five parents. The boards, whose decisions would be reached by majority vote, would have jur isdiction over “any proposed changes concerning exams, pro grams, school year calendar, discipline, faculty, entrance re quirements, curricular activi ties and general school policy.” Other Points Pressed Among other points made by the council were the fol lowing: ¶A “truly representative” student government should be established in each school — “free from domination by the administration and faculty ad viser” — with the right to act on all matters concerning stu dents. ¶Students should be entitled to freedom of expression “not only in the classroom but ev erywhere in the school,” and no student shall be penalized for an idea he expresses. ¶Students “shall be free from illegal use of police by school officials as an adjunct of their own authority, in the absence of crime or any threat of crime.” ¶All students should have the right to receive informa tion from a personal counselor on abortion, contraception, drugs and the draft, “without fear that it will be recorded on his record.” ¶There should be no “track ing systems in the school to di rect minority groups into in ferior occupations and women into traditional ‘women's occu pations.’” In drawing up their own list of student rights and responsi bilities, the G.O. Council re jected a proposed policy state ment on this subject issued last fall by the Board of Education. Although many principals then charged that the school board's statement went too far and would undercut their au thority and lead to chaos in the schools, student spokesmen have asserted that it did not go far enough. “The Board of Education has no contact with students,” young Reeves, the G.O. Coun cil president, said. “Its state ment does not even begin to confront the problems now ex isting in the high schools. “The board enumerated the rights and responsibilities but did not provide channels through which students may achieve reforms within the sys tem,” he added. Right to Dissent Recognized The board's statement, which was prepared by Dr. Seymour P. Lachman, the Brooklyn member, defined the personal and political freedoms of high school students and included recognition of the right to peaceful dissent. In contrast to the students' proposal for a liaison board with binding authority, the city board said that student repre sentatives should meet at least monthly with the principal “to exchange views” and “to share in the formulation of school student policies.” A public hearing on the board's proposed statement will be held Thursday by the board from 3 to 6 P.M. and 8 to 11 P.M. at the Klitgord Cen ter Auditorium of the New York City Community College, 285 Jay Street in Brooklyn. At that time, the G.O. Council's proposal will be formally sub mitted to the board. Leaders of the G.O. Council and other groups are also scheduled to hold a news can ference today to announce formation of a “high‐school student rights coalition” and to disclose actions planned by students for Thursday's hear ing “and beyond into the spring.” The city G.O. Council con sists of representatives select ed by the elected student gov ernments, or local General Organization Councils, from each city high school. Mr. Reeves said that last week's meeting was attended by one delegate from each school as well as the presidents of the individual school G.O.'s. Dr. Jacob B. Zack, an as sistant superintendent, ex pressed criticism yesterday of the way the meeting was run. Meeting Called Rig “During the meeting, rules of parliamentary procedures were apparently ignored,” Dr. Zack said. “The meeting was apparently rigged in that it was steered from the beginning by previous arrangement with rep resentatives from recognized dissident and militant student organizations based in the high schools and colleges of New York City, such as the Third World Committee and the Stu dent Mobilization Committee.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bill to Legalize Abortions Clears Hawaii Legislature,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/02/25/archives/bill-to-legalize-abortions-clears-hawaii-legislature-bill-on.html,"HONOLULU, Feb. 24—Hawaii's Senate approved today and sent to Gov. John A. Burns a bill that would make this state's abortion law the most liberal of any in the nation. Mr. Burns, a Roman Catholic, has indicated that he will let the bill become law without signing it. The measure repeals the state's 101‐year‐old abortion statute and legalizes abortions performed by a Iicensed physi cian or osteopath in a hospital licensed by the state or Federal Government. The old law permitted abor tions only if the woman's life was in danger. The new bill would allow any woman who had lived in Hawaii for at least 90 days to have an abortion simply because she did not want to have a baby. Church Waged Fight However, the embryo or fetus would have to be “nonviable” Legislative lawyers interpret this to mean that women would be eligible only if they were in the first four or five months of pregnancy. The Senate approved the bill by a vote of 15 to 9, with one member excused from voting. The House of Representatives approved it last week, 31 to 20. The Roman Catholic Church waged a long battle to try to keep the abortion bill from passing. Governor Burns and Sena tor Vincent H. Yano, both of whom have key roles in de ciding whether the bill will be come law, said before the measure was put to a vote that they felt an abortion should be left to the individual decision of the mother and doctor. Mr. Yano also is a Catholic. The Senate, under the skilled maneuvering of Senator Yano, who is chairman of the Public Health Committee, passed the abortion bill, 17 to 7 on Feb. 10. The House, by an untallied voice vote, rejected it the fol lowing day. The bill then went to conference committee, where the amendment relating to a three‐month residence re quirement was written in. Many legislators believe that the residence requirement is un constitutional in view of the Federal case of Shapiro vs. Thompson, which outlawed res idency requirements in welfare cases. However, pressure was so heavy on the Jegislators that they decided to go ahead with final approval. The House en dorsed the conference report on Feb. 20 by a 31‐to‐20 vote. Representative George W. T. Loo, who was co‐chairman of the joint conference committee, said, “I am glad that it is all over. I feel this is something we all can live with, and I hope it is not abused.” He and several other legis lators had feared that Honolulu would become an “abortion mill.” Cost Is Estimated The conference committee said that an abortion in Hawaii under the new law would cost about $200, including the physi cian's fee. However, this estimate may be somewhat low. A legal abor tion in Honolulu today costs an average of $300, of which about half is the physician's fee. John Griffin, the editorial page editor of The Honolulu Advertiser, said that the vol ume of letters to the editor on the abortion issue had set a record. “Certainly, for emotionalism, there has not been anything to match it,” he said. Hawaii's labor unions were unanimous in their support of the reform bill, and since they wield a strong influence in elec tions, their wishes were re spected by many legislators. All 76 legislators are up for election this year, as are the Governor and Lieutenant Gov ernor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A Summary of Supreme Court Actions,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/02/25/archives/a-summary-of-supreme-court-actions.html,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 24— The Supreme Court took the following actions today: ABORTION Let stand a ruling of the Supreme Court of California that the state's law making abortion a crime, which has since been replaced with a more liberal law, is unconsti tutional (No. 971, California v. Belous). CONDEMNATION Ruled, 6 to 2, that in a land condemnation suit the judge and not the jury shall decide if the land taken by the Government was outside the scope of the original Gov ernment project, so that if it was, the property owner could demand payment for the enhanced value of his property by virtue of its proximity to the project (No. 88, United States v Reynolds.) CRIMINAL LAW Held, 7 to 0, that the Gov ernment did not violate the rights of two men who were indicted for violation of the drug laws at about the same time that the Food and Drug Administration sued their company and demanded in formation that could have been used against them in the criminal prosecution (No. 87, United States v. Kordel). Agreed to decide if a search warrant is valid when supported by the sworn statement of an informant whose reliability is unknown to the police but who im pressed them as a prudent person (No. 388 United States v. Harris). Agreed to construe for the first time amendments to the Federal habeas corpus law that were passed in 1966 in an effort to prevent state convicts from re‐litigating is sues that were ruled upon years before at their trials (No. 642, Wilson v. Atchley). LABOR Held that former employes of the Delaware, Lackawan na & Western Railroad who lost their jobs when that line merged with the Erie Railroad to form the Erie‐Lacka wanna Railroad had a legal right to sue the union and the merged line for giving the Erie Line's former em ployes most of the Erie Lackawanna's jobs. (No. 234, Czosek v. O'Mara). Agreed to decide if a union commits an unfair labor practice when it brings pres sure on a neutral employer to force it to induce another employer with which it does business to submit to the union's demands (No. 557, National Labor Relations Board v. Local 825; No. 570, Burns & Roe, Inc. v. Local 825). LIBEL Agreed to decide if a radio station is protected by the First Amendment from a libel suit by a distributor of nudist magazines when the station falsely but without malice called him a major distributor of obscene mate rial (No. 947, Rosenbloom v. Metromedia). Agreed to decide if a pub lished charge by the late columnist Drew Pearson that a political candidate was a “former small time boot legger” was a purely private libel that is not entitled to the protection of the First Amendment's bar against damage judgments for, non malicious defamation of pub lic figures' official acts (No. 891, Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy). SCHOOLS Affirmed a lower court's holding that the State of Vir ginia is not required by the Federal Constitution to spend approximately equal sums on the public schools of all of its school districts (No. 864, Burruss v, Wilkerson).

TELEVISION Let stand a lower court holding that the Federal Com munications Commission has the legal power to authorize the creation of pay‐television systems (No. 932, National Association of Theater Own ers v. Federal Communica tions Commission).

Matthews). Agreed to decide if the one‐ man, one‐vote doctrine pre cludes a state from permit ting only real property tax payers to vote in elections to approve issuance of revenue bonds that would constitute a lien on all taxable property in the taxing district (No. 1066, Phoenix v. Kolodziej ski). Agreed to rule on the apportionment of the Board of Supervisors of Rockland County, N.Y., under the one‐ man, one‐vote doctrine (No. 1033, Abate v. Mundt). WELFARE Agreed to review a lower court's ruling that New York discriminated unconstitution ally against rural welfare cli ents by allowing higher pay ments for welfare recipients in New York City than in the rest of the state (No. 896, Wyman v. Rothstein). Granted the State of New York's appeal of a lower court holding that would pre vent home visits by welfare caseworkers to determine how families spend their wel fare money (No. 977, Wyman v. James). Affirmed a lower court's ruling that New York State cannot constitutionally deny welfare benefits to persons who migrate there solely to go on the welfare rolls (No. 866, Wyman v. Bowens).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
California Ruling Stands,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/02/25/archives/california-ruling-stands.html,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 24—The Supreme Court avoided ruling today on the volatile issue of abortion when it declined to review a decision of the Supreme Court of California that declared that state's antiabor tion law unconstitutional. In its decision, the California court held that the state's anti abortion statute was so broad that it infringed upon women's rights of privacy in sex in mar riage and upon their freedom to choose whether to bear children. The California law, which is similar to those in about 35 states, permitted physicians to perform a therapeutic abortion on a woman only when “neces sary to preserve her life.” This was held to be unconstitution ally vague.

Panic and Pregnancies Linked To Senate Inquiry on Birth Pill,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/02/25/archives/panic-and-pregnancies-linked-to-senate-inquiry-on-birth-pill.html,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 24— A New York obstetrician told a Congressional subcommittee today that publicity generated by its hearings on hazards of birth control pills had caused “panic” among women using the drug and “dozens of un wanted pregnancies.” Dr. Elizabeth Connell, an as sociate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Columbia College of Physicians and Sur geons, told the Senate Subcom mittee on Monopoly that “we are just beginning to see the first of the pregnancies of wo men who panicked in January, stopped using their pills and did not seek or use another means of birth control.” In an interview, Dr. Connell said: “We're getting into the doz ens, that I know of, and there probably are many more who have stopped using the pill, be come pregnant and not come back to our clinics.” Dr. Connell said that she knew of a 14‐year‐old girl who became pregnant after she stopped using oral contracep tives. The doctor added that New York doctors were per forming abortions on women who have had undesired preg nancies since the subcommittee hearings started six weeks ago. “Women became frightened,” said the petite blonde mother of six who testified for 2½ hours, often fending off nointed questions from Senator Gaylord Nelson, Democrat of Wisconsin, the subcommittee chairman. Nelson Explanation Senator Nelson insisted that the hearings were intended to call attention to the potential hazard of the use of oral con traceptives and to the need for more information about the use of birth control pills being given to American women. But as the hearings resumed today political undertones emerged, with Mr. Nelson dig ging at pro‐pill statements, while three Republican subcom mittee members challenged an ti‐pill positions of the six wit nesses who testified. These included Dr. Phillip Ball, of Muncie, Ind., who urged a five‐year ban on the use of oral contraceptives because doctors “have been wrong about birth control pills.” Dr. Ball said he has refused to prescribe the pills for four years because of harmful side effects, including psychological changes in the users. The doctor said that many times a husband would call and say, “Do something about my wife—my God, she's just turned into a bitch.” The doctor cited this to illustrate that many wo men do not know themselves what the effect of the pills are. Exchanges on Data Dr. Francis Kane, a psychia trist at the University of North Carolina Medical School, and Dr. John R. McCain, an Atlanta obstetrician, both testified that they had seen women who had become extremely psychotic and sometimes suicidal after having used the pill. Their testimony provoked long exchanges with three sub committee Republicans, Sen ator Jacob K. Javits of New York, Senator Robert J. Dole of Kansas, and Senator Mark O Hatfield of Oregon, over the interpretation of the data that were presented. The total num ber of cases the two physician reported that they had per sonally observed was about two dozen. Two other witnesses, Dr. Kenneth J. Ryan, chairman of the Department of Reproduc tive Biology at Case Western Reserve University in Cleve land; and Dr. Paul Meier, a professor of statistics at the University of Chicago, repeated a theme that many subcom mittee witnesses had voiced in the past: that not enough is known about the effects of birth control pills to draw solid conclusions about the medical hazards of their use. Dr. Connell of Columbia ex pressed the same senti ments, but added that birth control pills should remain on the market because the social, psychological and medical risks of their use outweighed their potential for harm. Dr. Connell, the first woman to testify at the hearings, de clined to state if she had or would take oral contraceptives herself but said she had told a member of her family “if she ever took another pill she would be out of her mind.” “To date these hearings have not made our lives any easier,” Dr. Connell said. “I think much of the previous testimony has been rather like a bikini; what it has uncovered has been interesting, but what it has left concealed is vital.” Dr. Connell, who has estab lished and directed birth con trol clinics in New York, reiterated the beliefs of many leaders of the family planning movement. These are that the pills are not suitable for all women — in fact may be harmful to some — but that oral contraceptives are ex tremely beneficial to large numbers of women who for various reasons are not able to effectively use other con traceptive methods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expert Decries ‘Alarm’ on Birth‐Curb Pill,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/02/26/archives/expert-decries-alarm-on-birthcurb-pill.html,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 25 (AP) — A specialist in population control testified today that sus pected complications from birth control pills are second‐ ary to the medical and social dangers of pregnancy.  Dr. Alan F. Guttmacher, head of Planned Parenthood, told the Senate Subcommittee on Mo nopoly that its hearings on the safety of the pill had spread “unwarranted and dangerous alarm” throughout the world. Nearly all side effects are un important or reversible, and the only proved complication that can be fatal is blood clotting, the doctor said. But this, he said, kills only 1.5 of every 100,000 women a year in the 20 to 34 age brack et, while pregnancy takes 22.8 lives. Among women 34 to 44 years old, 3.9 of every 100,000 die from blood clotting associated with the pill, while 57.6 in every 100,000 die from the complications of pregnancy, he said. Besides reducing the risk of death, Dr. Guttmacher went on, the pill has proved to be the most effective safeguard known against “one of the gravest socio‐medical illnesss unwanted pregnancy.” Dr. Guttmacher testified at the sixth session of hearings by the subcommittee, headed by Senator Gaylord Nelson, Demo crat of Wisconsin. The hearings have focused on scores of sus pected complications and side effects. “The impact of these hear ings has washed up on the shores of nearly every coun try,” said Dr. Guttmacher, whose organization counsels 350,000 women at 525 centers in 130 cities. As one example of this im pact, he cited a hospital in Har lem where he said growing pop ularity of the pill had caused a sharp drop in abortions. He said 67 per cent of the women treated by the hospital's birth control clinic preferred the pill “until these hearings made headlines.” “I am afraid to estimate the Harlem Hospital figures for 1970, but it is fair to assume that the proportion of birth control pill users will decline acutely, abortion admissions will rise, abortion deaths will go up, and in 1971 deliveries also will increase,” he said. The doctor said that in the United States between 200,000 and one million abortions are performed annually, 300,000 il legitimate children are born, at least one out of six brides is pregnant when married, and 70,000 unmarried girls a year under 18 bear children. “I don't accuse the hearings of any diabolic purpose,” he said, “but there is a tremendous amount of undigested pablum that comes out in the daily press.” When asked by Senator Nelson whether women should be given more information on possible side effects from the pill, Dr. Guttmacher remarked, “The dispenser of therapy should be educated, not the re cipient.” For the second day in a row, Senator Nelson defended the hearings, contending that they are simply an effort to bring out facts that he said were not being given by their doctors or by literature in the pill pack ages. Dr. Guttmacher was peri odically hissed by four mem bers of a group calling itself Washington's Liberation Front. The group disrupted several of the sessions held last month. The group announced it would hold its own hearings on March 7 to which, in a cir cular handed out at the hear ing, it invited women suffering ill‐effects from the pill to testify.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DOCTOR IS GUILTY IN ABORTION CASE,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/02/26/archives/doctor-is-guilty-in-abortion-case-judge-in-connecticut-bars-suicide.html,"NORWICH, Conn., Feb. 25— A jury of seven women and five men today convicted a 60 year‐old physician of violating Connecticut's 100‐year‐old abor tion law after the judge said that “the danger of [the wom an's] possible suicide” should not be considered.  The doctor, Morris Sulman, a New London general prac titioner, said he would appeal his conviction to the State Su preme Court on constitutional grounds, mainly on the claim that a woman's mental condi tion during an unwanted preg nancy is as important as her physical condition. Connecticut law prohibits abortion except when “neces sary to preserve her [the wom an's] life or that of her un born child.” Patient Called Hysterical Dr. Sidman, testifying on his own behalf, admitted perform ing the abortion on a Sunday afternoon last March in his office in a residential area of New London on a 22‐year‐old woman. Dr. Sulman, who said he charged $600 for the opera tion, said the patient was “hys terical and distraught” and was suffering “acute depression with strong elements of obses sion and compulsion. Further testimony on the wo man's mental condition from Dr. Sulman and two other ex pert medical witnesses were blocked by Judge Barber's rulings. The defense attorney, Wil liam L. Hadden, a former Lieu tenant Governor and State At torney General, said his appeal would be based largely on the evidence excluded. Mr. Hadden successfully defended Dr. Sul man 11 years ago against sim ilar charges. The woman admitted on the witness stand that she lied to Dr. Sulman to convince him to perform the abortion. She said she told him the father of the child was a married man and that the news of her preg nancy might have fatally shocked her elderly father who she said had a heart ailment. The Connecticut abortion law is very similar to those in Cali fornia and Washington, D. C., which have been declared un constitutional by appeal courts. New York also has a law pro hibiting abortions except to save the woman's life.

Legalizing Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/03/archives/legalizing-abortion.html,"The revolutionary change in public attitudes toward abortion has been dramaticalIY illustrated in a new law just passed by the Hawaiian Legislature.

The anti abortion law California had before 1967 was declared unconstitutional by the state's StipreMe Cotut, an opinion the United ‘States Supreme. Court has just declined to review. California now has a less. restric tive law on abortion, but the original legislation's judicial demise bodes ill for the very similar New York law whose constitutionality is scheduled to be considered by a three‐judge Federal court this spring. The change of public opinion evidenced by the trend of recent legislation and court decisions is due in part to a heightened understanding of the world wide menace of overpopulation.

Albany Allows C.P.A.'s To Keep Silent on Clients,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/04/archives/albany-allows-cpas-to-keep-silent-on-clients.html,"ALBANY, March 3—Final leg islative approval was voted to day on a bill to assure that communications between certi fied public accountants and their clients would not be divulged.  The measure, which was sent Governor. Rockefeller, was approved 29 to 22 in the Senate amid complaints by opponents that it would foil investigations into organized Crime. Under the bill, accountants and: their clients could not be compelled at trials or hearings to disclose confidential com munications. This is the same privilege granted to lawyers and their clients. Senator John D. Caemmerer, Republican of Nassau County who supported the measure, ar gued that the bill was required by complexities. of :modern business life, in which an ac countant was often as much a confidante as a lawyer. There is “absolutely, no intent to as sist organized crime,” Mr. Caemnierer declared. However, Senator Abraham Bernstein, Democrat of the Bronx, said that “by. passing this bill we will be impeding progress of the Joint Legisla tive Committee On Crime.” The committee, Mr. Bernstein said, has been considering the pos sibility of calling the account ants of reluctant Witnesses to testify. Housing Finance Bill In other actions, the Senate passed. and sent to the As sembly a measure that would permit private financing in terests, including banks, ‘unions and foundations, to invest jointly with public agencies in the rehabilitation of slum housing. Senator Roy M. Goodman, Republican of Manhattan said private interests did not find it attractive to make such invest ments on their own. The meas ure, he said, would share the risk with the public sector and “sweeten” interest rates and other conditions of rehabilita tion loans. However, one of the few dissenters in the ‘Vote, Senator Samuel L. Greenberg, Demo crat of Brooklyn, described the measure as an illustration of politicians “trying to make the people believe they are doing something for housing, When it wouldn't do a darn thing.”  A bill described as a com promise proposal for reforming the state law against abortion was introduced into the Senate today. The bill was drafted by the staff of the Senate majority leader, Earl W. Brydges, Re publican of Niagara Falls. In the Past Mr. Brydges has been one of the leaders against changing the abortion law and a spokesman emphasized today that this was still the case. The point of the bill, the spokesman added, was to evolve a measure meeting certain reservations of the Senator, such as a defini tion of when a fetus should be inviolable, so that he might permit it to reach the Senate floor. In all probability, the spokes man added, the majority leader would still vote against reform. The Senate judiciary subcom mittee on the Family Court issued a report today describing “feelings of remoteness and lack of support” between Fam ily Court judges and probation personnel. The report, which was re leased by Senator Bernard G. Gordon, Republican of Peeks kill, recommended that perma nent, “authoritative” units be set up in the Appellate Division to take over day‐to‐day admin istration of the Family Court, described as the “stepchild” of the judiciary., California System Praised A statewide study of the pro bation system was proposed, along with a study of Cali fornia's system, which Senator Gordon described as promising. That system, he said, provides subsidies for counties to expand their probation facilities and re tain local control, rather than launching state construction programs for new facilities. The Assembly put off a heavy slate of business until tomorrow, adjourning after a round of praise for visiting of ficers from the United‐ States Military Academy at West Point.

The suit, which seeks a rul ing by a three‐judge Federal Court on a statute that is more than a century old, charges that the constitutional rights of women are violated and that the physicians included as plaintiffs in the action are “hin dered, chilled, threatened, and adversely affected by the actual or threatened enforce ment” of the law. Lawyers for the plaintiffs complained that present state law was one of the most op pressive in the country, mak ing it a “high misdemeanor” to cause an abortion “without lawful justification.” The State Supreme Court, they said, has so far ruled that an abortion is permissible only when neces sary to save the mother. 2 Plaintiffs Imprisoned Among the several New Jersey gynecologists, obstetri cians, pediatricians and psy chiatrists listed as plaintiffs in the suit are two who have been convicted of illegal abortions and conspiracy, and whose licenses to practice in New Jersey have been revoked. One, Dr. Sherwin. H. Ray mond of Ridgefield, was re cently released from prison after having served two years of a five‐to‐seven‐year sen tence. The other, Dr. Ralph D. Cavalli of Camden, is currently serving a six‐to‐nine‐year term. Today's action coincides with the expected introduction in the State Legislature next week of an abortion reform bill known as the Crane proposal. The measure is a result of study and public hearings by a special nine‐member commis sion established in 1968 that is headed by Assemblyman Wil liam M. Crane, a Bergen County Republican. Provisions of Bill The Crane bill, tentatively scheduled to go before the Legislature Monday, calls for the legalization of abortions in cases of rape or incest, when the life of the mother is in jeopardy, when the mental health of the mother is en dangered, or when the mother is 16 years old or under and unmarried. Today's suit was filed in be half of the plaintiffs by the state branch of the American Civil Liberties Union, the James Madison Constitutional Law In stitute of New York and several individual lawyers. The defendant is listed as George F. Kugler Jr., the State Attorney General, because he is “clothed with the duty of enforcing the statutes here in question.” In addition to the physicians among those named as plain tiffs are women representing the Princeton Y.M.C.A. and the New Jersey branch of the Wo men's International League for Peace and Freedom, the other plaintiff organization. The complaint charges that the state abortion statutes, dat ing to 1846, deprive the doc tors and their patients of “the right to privacy in the physi cian‐patient relationship,” de prive the doctors of the right to practice medicine according to the highest standard, and de prive the female plaintiffs of “the fundamental right of a wo man to choose whether to bear children.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"MAYOR ENDORSES ABORTION REPEAL; Lindsay Reverses Position, Cites Problem in City",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/08/archives/mayor-endorses-abortion-repeal-lindsay-reverses-position-cites.html,"Total repeal of the state's abortion law was urged yester day by Mayor Lindsay. The Mayor altered his stand on abortion, which has emerged as a major issue in the last two sessions of the Legislature. Previously, he noted in statement issued by his City Hall office, he had called for changes in the law. Now he favors outright repeal. “I realize,” Mr. Lindsay said, “that many people hold reli gious and philosophical convic tions which find abortion to be an un acceptble solution to this problem. By removing this question from the penal law altogether, the state avoids making any moral judgments on this subject. “For all these reasons I hope that the New York Legislature will now move forward and repeal the present law, leaVing the decision to be made by, the pregnant woman and her physician.” City Problem Said Severe Mr. Lindsay's statement said the problem in New York City was a severe one. “According to Dr. Milton Helpern, our Medical Examiner, more than 20 women die each year from nonhospital‐performed abor tions, making this the largest single cause of maternal death in our city,” it said. Last year the Assembly re jected a proposed relaxation of New York's abortion laws pro posed by Assemblyman Albert H. Blumenthal, a Manhattan Democrat, after an emotional .appeal by a handicapped legis lator who suggested that the measure's description of those cases in which abortion would be permitted might have pre cluded his being born. The present state law permits abortions only when the moth er's life Is endangered. This year both relaxation and outright repeal are before the Legislature. Mr. Lindsay said in his state ment: “In 1967 I Issued a statement favoring changes in New York's law on abortion along the lines recommended by the American Law Institute. This statement was supported by the then commissioner of Health, Dr. Edward O'Rourke, and was submitted to the New York Legislature in support of the Blumenthal bill. Other States Have Acted “Since that time some dozen states other than New York have adopted laws along the lines recommended by the A.L.I. and Assemblyman Blumenthal. An analysis of those laws, however, shows that, while a five‐to‐ten‐fold Increase in the number of hospital‐performed abortions has occurred, proce dural difficulties still prevent large numbers of women, par ticularly among the poor, from receiving necessary hospital care for the termination of an inadvisable pregnancy. “In addition recent Federal and state court decisions, not ably in Washington, D. C., and in California, have cast consid erable doubt not only on the constitutionality of New York's law but on the right of the state to over‐regulate this area of medical need on the grounds invasion of it constitutes an invasion of privacy.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
News Summary and Index,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/08/archives/news-summary-and-index-the-major-events-of-the-daysection-1.html,"SUNDAY, MARCH 8, 1970 International A further spiral of the arms race would benefit neither the Soviet Union nor the United States, a Soviet policy statement published yesterday in Pravda said. Al though the statement questioned American sincerity in wanting an agreement to limit strategic arms, it said there were “possibili ties” for reaching such an agreement in the Soviet‐American talks scheduled to resume in Vienna on April 16. [Page 1, Column 8.] Misguided Washington policies have been frustrating United States efforts to improve life in underdeveloped countries, a diplo matic adviser to the Secretary of State says in a controversial secret report. The adviser, Edward M. Korry, Ambassador to Chile, calls for a new approach to economic de velopment. [1:6‐7.] American and Laotian air missions over Laos are coordinated by a joint center in Vientiane, the commander, of the Royal Laotian ‘Air Force Base at Pakse disclosed. The center is evidence of the active role of American planes in Laos. Officially, only Laotian planes fly combat missions over the country. [1:6‐7.] If revolution comes to the Philippines, could start among the hungry cane‐field workers. “Even the Roman slaves before the birth of Christ were treated better than these workers,” a priest commented. And a plan tation owner, considered radical because he conforms to minimum‐wage laws, said his “biggest problem” is trying to see that his workers can go to mass each week instead of once a year. [14:1‐8.] National President Nixon, in a statement issued at his Florida White House, announced that the United States would launch an unmanned probe of the solar system's outer planets and a nuclear‐powered rocket during the next decade. The space goals he set were considered ambitious but tempered by plans to keep spending at current levels. [1:1.] Millions of people across much of North America saw the moon pass in front of the sun in one of nature's rarest spectacles, solar eclipse. Thousands of sightseers crowded beaches, towns and islands in the path of the total eclipse, while hundreds of scientists conducted experiments. 11:2‐4.] The prosperous suburbs should not leave city slum‐dwellers alone to solve their prob lems themselves because the “resources needed to solve the urban poverty problem —land, money and jobs—are presently scarce in the inner cities,” Vice President Agnew told the National Alliance of Busi nessmen. “They exist in substantial supply in suburban areas,” he added, and should be put to use to solve city problems. [1:5.] School integration will be pursued by the Administration only as it achieves educa tional purposes and does not disrupt the neighborhood school concept or require too much more busing. ‘That, after more than year of confusion, has emerged as the Nix on Administration's school desegregation policy. It coincides perfectly with the Presi dent's 1968 campaign promises. [1:3‐4.] Metropolitan Just’ when the city's efforts against air pollution have begun showing progress, ob stacles have arisen. One was a state Court of Appeals decision that prevents the city's’ air pollution control inspectors from issuing summonses for excessive smoke, faulty equipment and other violations. Action on pending past summonses is also endangered by the ruling, which declared that only police, officers can issue summonses. [1:6‐8.] Mayor Lindsay, in a change in his stand on abortion, urged total repeal of the state's abortion law. Previously, Mr. Lindsay had asked for changes in the law. By removing some people's moral objections to abortion “from the penal law altogether, the state avoids making any moral judgments on this subject,” the Mayor explained.

Books to Liberate Women,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/08/archives/books-to-liberate-women.html,"Isn't it ironic that the book publishing industry which has always underpaid, underrated and underemployed the second sex, should now be gallantly courting the women's liberation movement? Almost every major publish er either has a feminist under contract or wishes he did. One senior editor dispatched an agent to make overtures to Jane Albert, who is currently out on bail after being charged with conspiring to bomb Fed eral property. Another editorial eminence cooked lunch for Ti Grace Atkinson while one of his female subordinates talked turkey with the radical femi nist who won't have anything to do with men except for compelling business reasons. The interest in the latest drive for total female equality “is like the panic that hit pub lishing six or seven years ago when everyone was tripping over each other to get a black list,” says Robin Morgan, the poet and women's lib leader who is an editor for Grove Press (which doesn't have any thing scheduled yet) and is ed iting “The Hand That Cradles the Rock,” a basic primer of the movement that Random House is hoping to have in the bookstores by fall. Random House is more or less the darling of the radical feminist writers, many of whom feel ambivalent about consorting with Establishment, male chauvinist publishers. Not only did one of its sub sidiaries, Alfred A. Knopf, pub lish the English version of Simone de Beauvoir's feminist bible, “The Second Sex,” back in 1953, but Random House has a few young editors like Jane Seitz and Connie Brown who go to women's lib meet ings and can pass muster with radical feminist authors who refuse to be edited by the i.e., a man. Pantheon, a Random House division, has signed up Juliet Mitchell, an English feminist scholar whose essay, “The Longest Revolution,” appears in at least the footnotes of nearly every radical analysis of the cause. The first of the new wave of feminist books is Kate Millett's “Sexual Politics,” which Dou bleday will publish in July. A chapter of this searing analysis of sexual power and oppres sion by a Barnard philosophy instructor appeared last sum Miss Bender is a women's news reporter for this news paper and author of “The Beau tiful People.” mer in New American Review Number 7. Another highly intellectual and politically directed ap proach will be found in “The Dialectic of Sex The Case for Feminist Revolution,” which Morrow hopes Shulamith Fire stone will complete in time for fall publication. Miss Firestone is the 25‐year‐old organizer of the Stanton Anthony Brigade and an underground writer who has hitherto supported herself by waitressing, portrait paint ing on sidewalks and nude mod eling. She “screened” James Landis who is editing her book for Morrow. “He's happily mar ried, has a good relationship with his wife and I didn't think he'd try to sabotage the book,” For Miss Firestone and many of her sisters in the movement, copyright poses another dilem ma, inasmuch as “it signifies capitalist society.” In the un derground press where most of them have been writing until now, articles are not copy righted. “In the movement, possessiveness about ideas is terrible,” Miss Firestone ex plained, “but as soon as you're dealing with the Establishment, you don't want your ideas sto len.” Overground, the sisters are submitting to copyright. The single biggest category of women's liberation book is the anthology. Basic B6oks has Vivian Gornick, a staff writer for The Village Voice, and Bar bara K. Moran, a writer‐editor, soliciting contributions for “Fif ty‐One Percent The Case for Women's Liberation.” Like Robin Morgan's book for Ran dom House, it will probe every aspect of sexual discrimination from economic to psychologi cal, and will include a critique of Sigmund Freud, one of wom en's liberation's arch villains. Basic Books, by the way, is major publisher of Freudian Other scheduled antholo gies are New American Li brary's “The Women's Libera tion Movement,” by Leslie B. Tanner (a pseudonym for a movement member), for spring, 1971, and “Anthology on Black Women,” by Toni Cade (for August, 1970), which will cover the distinctive strain of black women's liberation. Har per's is bringing out a paper back anthology, still untitled, by Betty Roszak. Gloria Stein em, whom many consider the quintessential liberated brainy beauty, is preparing a collec tion of women's liberation read ings for New York Magazine's sortie into book publishing. One fall entry that is certain to be attacked from the distaff side is Little, Brown's “Daugh ters of Zion Women in Amer ican History” inasmuch as its author, Page Smith, is a male historian. Other books that will try to jump on the women's lib bandwagon are (on May 6) World's “Service and Rebel lion,” a radical youth manifesto that includes a section on wom en's inequality and is written by Paul Lauter, a professor who's a specialist on Virginia Woolf (a feminist literary deity) and his wife Florence Howe, a women's liberationist; the guide for the college‐educated who wants to get back to work after a domestic hiatus that Marilyn Mercer has agreed to do for Simon & Schuster; and the collection of abortion repeal testimony that McGraw‐Hill is in the process of signing up a Doubleday describes its April entry, “How to Make It in a Man's World” by Letty Pogre bin, the resourceful public‐re lations director of Bernard Geis Associates, as “a middle of the road point of view” on female emancipation. “I say yes eco nomically and legally but I don't want it romantically and I don't want my children in a kibbutz,” Mrs. Pogrebin The seeds of feminism can not be planted too early. Alix Shulman, a movement writer who will eventually deliver a personal testament for Harper & Row, is presently complet ing a biography of Emma Gold man for Thomas Y. Crowell's Women of America series in tended for junior‐high school readers. “We're using the wom en's liberation theme in the advertising for the series,” ac knowledged Sophie Silber berg, Crowell's advertising di rector. The book publishers’ hunch that feminism may be the dom inant social movement of the seventies (“the next two big revolutions are going to be women and then homosexuals,” says Coward‐McCann“s Ellis Amburn) follows a spate of newspaper and magazine ar ticles. The latest is Atlantic“s “Women Against Men” issue for March. Women“s liberation has al ready produced its own prolif erating literary movement via such journals as Women A Journal of Liberation; Aphra, a literary quarterly; No More Fun and Games, a Boston product; and Up From Under, the latest brand of personal political jour nalism published by a New York women's lib collective. All of them have encountered distribution problems. Whether women's libera tion will turn out to be a pub lishing flash in the pan or a profitable mine remains to be seen. Certainly, the immediate future holds a scramble for contracts and an assortment of quickie projects. “There will be a lot of ex ploitation,” predicts Morrow's James Landis. “Women's libera tion will be spread around cul turally, and it will be blunted. Even before the first book gets out, it will have been in Life and in the women's magazines and on the Johnny Carson show. Will that cause books to sell? Booksellers don't sell so many black books. Vietnam war books sell terribly. I don't know what kind of audience women's liberation will have.” One sign, for paperback houses, at least, is the recent ly improved sales for reprints of earlier classics like Eleanor Flexner's “Century of Strug gle” (originally published by Harvard University Press in 1959; Atheneum reprint 1968) and Caroline Bird's “Born Fe male,” which David McKay published in 1968 and Pocket books reprinted last year. “1 wish I were publishing it now,” says Eleanor Rawson, who ed ited Miss Bird's book for Mc Kay. Incidentally, Random House has transferred the hefty ad vance for Betty Friedan's sec ond book, “The New Woman,” which she never got around to writing, to a third book that will have something to do with women as part of the total human revolution. “I'm skipping book number two. It turned out to be action instead of writing,” says the author of “The Feminine Mys tique” (Norton, 1963) which drove the college‐educated housewife out of the kitchen and into the job market. In 1966, Miss Friedan formed NOW (National Organiza tion for Women) and has been busy ever since putting teeth into the antisex discrimination provisions of the Civil Rights Act. “Isn't it interesting that there will be 10 books on the woman thing this year, Miss Friedan observed chberfully. “I'm glad mine isn't one of them.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Saint Laurent's American Sportswear,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/10/archives/saint-laurents-american-sportswear.html,"HEADS up, members of the women's liberation movement. Everything's been so free on the fashion front for so long, there hasn't been much to tilt at.

Amelia Bloomer, after all, inventeihbloomers more than 100 years ago, to protest re strictive dress Can modern women let the challenge slip through their hands? Just Being America The designer, apparently, is not determined to send women back to the stove. He's juit being American, ac cording to Mary Russell, his Girl Friday, who brought his ready‐to‐wear collection to his Rive Gauche boutique at 855 Madison Ayenue (near 70th Street) yesterday, and explained how it works at a Champagne party for his fans. “It's really American Sportswear,”’ she said. “Yves. is using totally American fabrics like calico, denim and sailcloth. It's non‐matching tops and bottoms,. put to gether in different ways and worn with the right accesso ries, of course.” The acceessories are those tooled leather belts ($30 to $40), dog collars ($7.50 to $15) and boots which you will have to go to Paris for since they're not yet avail able here; If the right boots aren't handy, the designer helpfully suggest high‐heeled Mary Janes will do. Saint Laurent has been im pressed with America before. A few years back he bought a pea jacket in an Army Navy store in New York and made it a star in his couture collection. More recently, he helped put women all over the world in pants. So what about the tight jackets and the long skirts? It seems pioneer women and the Old West are fasci nating him now, according to Miss Russell. The blue denith skirts and the black chintz ones are supposed to be worn with calico shirts in the fron tier spirit. If bosoms and waistlines come into focus, it's just an unearned incre ment. No Dogmatism “Yves hasn't abandoned short skirts,” she added, pointing to a micro‐mini in suede that's supposed to rest on the hips and is fringed up to the point of decency. Yves also isn't being dog matic about how long is long. “There's no rule, no inches from the floor—you find your own level, somewhere below the calf and above the ankle,” said Miss Russell. Of course, that's the way things happen in ready to wear, and the designer is out to garner the young vote. The blue denim skirt, for exam ple, is offered as a replace ment for blue jeans. It costs $35, which in couture terms is hardly anything. For the young, it might be a lot of bread.

JUDICIAL CENSURE BACKED IN JERSEY,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/10/archives/judicial-censure-backed-in-jersey-bill-sought-by-state-court-is.html,"TRENTON, March 9 — The New Jersey Senate approved measure today that would em power. the State Supreme Court to remove judges for miscon dtict. Coincidentally, a Federal Ap peals Court authorized the be ginning of disciplinary hearings against a Union County judge charged with bribery in a case involving organized crime. Rudge Ralph DeVita of the Union County District Court, was indicted on Dec. 10 on charges of having attempted to bribe the Somerset County Prosecutor in a case against two Union County men accused of’ bookmaking and bri bery. Disciplinary proceedings ings against Judge DeVita were held up pending the decision by the Third United States Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadel‐. phia, which rejected the judge's contention that the proceedings would infringe on his constitu tional rights to a fair trial. When Judge DeVita was sus pended shortly before his in dictment, the State Supreme Court conceded that its power to remove him was question able. So the court requested today's measure, which imple ments a portion of the 1947 State Constitution and estab lishes removal proceedings be fore the entire, seven‐member court, the state's highest. The measure was approved unanimously and sent to the ASSeiribly, where its final pas, other developments, Gov. William. T. Cahill announced first three nominees for cclitnty prosecutors. They were Josenh D. J. Gourley in Pas saic County; Karl Asch in Union and ‘Dominick J. Ferrelli in Bur lington. All three are Republi cans. If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Gourley, 45 years old, would suceed John Thevos; Mr. Asch, 40, would succeed Leo J. Caplowitz, and Mr. Fer relli, 49, would replace Martin Queenan, who resigned late last year after being indicted for income tax evasion. Mr. Gourley Is a municipal judge in Wayne. Mr. Asch is an Elizabeth lawyer, and Mr. Fer relli is a law partner of John Dimon, the Burlington County Republican chairman. In the Senate, meanwhile, Harry L. Sears, the Republican majority leader from Morris County, said at a news confer ence that he was strongly op posed to a proposal that would establish legalized gambling in Atlantic City. In another legislatvie develop ment, an abortion reform pro posal was introduced in. the Assembly. The proposal, which was formulated by a study com mission headed by Assemblyman William M. Crane, a Bergen County Republican, is given little chance of passage this year. Under a 100‐year‐old statute, an abortion is unlawful unless “'lawfully justified” and the on justification thus far stipulated by the courts is when the life of the mother is in danger. The Senate gave initial ap proval to a measure that would require that airplane glue and other adhesives sniffed by teen agers to produce hallucinogenic highs include an ingredient that would preclude its inhalation.

State Senate to Act On Abortion Reform,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/11/archives/state-senate-to-act-on-abortion-reform-bill-on-abortion-in-state.html,"ALBANY, March 10—For the first time, the State Senate scheduled debate today on. an abortion‐reform bill, amid charges that the Republican majority leader, Earl W. Brydges, was moving a “hoax” measure as a device to insure its defeat  The bill, one of the most liberal proposed thus far in the United States, would m'ake, abortion a question only for a woman and her physician, with out qualifications. The present law, passed in 1828, permits termination of a pregnancy only when the woman's life'is in jeopardy. The Senate bill, Immediately, some propo nents of reform contended the committee action had been en gineered by Mr. Brydges as a device. “It's a hoax, a conspiracy by the archenemy of reform,” Senator Seymour R. Thaler, Queens Democrat. “He wants to lead a funeral march for reform with this.” Senator Thaler asserted that a more moderate reform meas ure could pass the Senate but that Senator Brydges would not permit such a bill to reach the floor. The result, Mr. Thaler contended, will be rejection of the bill reported out today and putting off of the issue to future Legislatures. A spokesman for Mr. Brydges denied this contention. “He doesn't play games with this kind of a thing,” the spokesman said, noting that proponents of reform had en dorsed the bill. The importance of the Sen ate's consideration of the con troversial issue was heightened late today when, the Speaker, of the Assembly, Perry B. Duryea Jr., indicated it was the key to action in his chamber. The Assembly has measures pending for outright repeal of the abortion law and for vari ous, more limited reforms. Debate Next Tuesday Mr. Duryea, a Republican from Suffolk County, said in an interview that while no “in depth conference” had been held on the topic in the As sembly outright repeal “ap pears to have the higher pri ority.” “We'll wait on. the Senate now,” Mr. Duryea, said. Asked how a defeat of the Senate ver sion would affect the Assembly, he replied: “That .Would close the case, more or less, over, here.” Mr. Brydges is not a sponsor of the Senate bill, or a member of the Codes Committee, but as majority leader he has great in fluence over the fate of bills. Senator Brydges' spokesman said the leader, who is from Niagara Falls, “probably will vote no” on the reform meas ure, which is expected to bedebated next Tuesday.  Momentum for changing the 19th‐century law has increased in the Legislature in the last foUr years. The Senate has not debated a reform measure until this year. Past Assembly ver sions died in committee and, last year, after an emotional floor debate, reform was re jected 78 W 69. This is an election year, which may heighten the politics of the issue. Beyond that, principals in the controversy have noted that a court challenge to the present law is under way that could make the issue moot in the Legislature. Governor Rockefeller has in dicated support of reform. The Roman Catholic Bishops, in the state issued a statement today condemning all the easy abortion proposals now pend ing in the Legislature.” “Such legislation cheapens all human life,” Charles J. To bin, a spokesman for the bis hops, declared in a letter to, legislative leaders. In contrast, the State Council of Churches argues that the is sue should be left to individual conscience. In the last two years, ization of abortion law has been taken up in various state legislatures, and reform has been approved in. Colorado, California, Arkansas, Delaware, Georgia, Kansas, Maryland, New. Mexico, North Carolina, Orgeon and Hawaii. Recent court decisions struck down abortion laws in Califor nia and the District of Colum bia. The next step in the chal lenge to the New York law is scheduled for April 15.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

States Are Pressing for Repeal of Abortion Laws,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/12/archives/states-are-pressing-for-repeal-of-abortion-laws.html,"The most liberal abortion law in the nation went into effect, yesterday in Hawaii amid grow ing signs across the country of rising support for repeal of abortion laws. Hawaii's new law is essen tially a repeal bill with certair limitations, among them a re quirement that a woman seek ing an abortion must be a resi dent of Hawaii for at least 90 days. Otherwise, an abortion ir. Hawaii today is strictly matter between the woman and her physician. The patient does not have to satisfy any criteria such as that her life or health is threatened or that her preg nancy is likely to result in the birth of a deformed child. A review last week of pend ing abortion legislation around the country indicated that other states may soon follow Hawaii's lead in adopting laws that make abortions a medical rather than a legal matter. It also appeared that in several states the courts may beat the legislatures to the punch. In Wisconsin last week, a three‐judge Federal panel ruled that state's abortion law unconstitutional, making abor tion early in pregnancy unre stricted if Wisconsin doctors and hospitals choose to take advantage of what is probably a temporary state of abeyance. In the District of Columbia, similar ruling last November by a Federal District Court appar ently has not resulted in any changes in medical handling of abortions. “No one is taking advantage of the situation,” said Elizabeth Elkind, executive director of the Abortion Reform Associa tion. “They're all waiting to see the results of an appeal.” Similar suits questioning the constitutionality of abortion laws are pending in several states, including New York and New Jersey. Meanwhile, at least 13 statt. legislatures now have before them bills like Hawaii's that would eliminate a statement of the medical conditions that must be satisfied before a doctor can legally perform an abortion. A bill even more liberal than Hawaii's in that it contains no residency requirement, was passed a week ago by the ‘Arizona House and sent to the Senate, which had killed liberalized abortion legislation in previous sessions. The Washington State Legis lature recently passed a repeal type of bill with certain restric tions, including a 90‐day resi dency requirement, that must go before a vote of the people next November. Observers be lieve it has a good chance of receiving the required majority vote. Even in New York, where the Legislature has killed abortion reform bills for four years run ning, a repeal type of bill is given a 50‐50 chance of passage during the current session. Last weekend, Mayor Lindsay announced his support for re peal of the state's 19th‐century abortion law. The current emphasis on re peal of abortion laws is a direct outgrowth of what many abor tion law activists regard as an unsuccessful experiment with changes in the law. Since Colorado took the lead in this area in 1967, 10 other states have eased restrictions on abortions by passing what is generally called reform legisla tion. In most cases this legisla tion permits doctors to perform abortions in hospitals if the pregnant woman's mental or physical health is seriously threatened, if her pregnancy re sulted from rape or incest or if her child is likely to be born with grave defects. The bulk of the opposition to abortion law reform has come from the Roman Catholic Church, which maintains that abortion is a form of murder. Mrs. Constance Cook, a mem ber of the New York Assembly from Ithaca who has sponsired legislation to repeal the state's labortion laws, says that “re peal i a more accpetable idea to the Catholics than reform because it takes the state out of the position of deciding who shall be born and who shall not.” But Albert Blumenthal, New York Assemblyman who is now supporting repeal after five years of sponsoring reform legislation; cautions that “the public is misled if it thinks that passage of repeal laws will result in a revolution in the abortion situation.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ABORTION REFORM IN JERSEY STALLED,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/13/archives/abortion-reform-in-jersey-stalled-change-in-law-this-year-is.html,"TRENTON, March 13—Lead ers of the overwhelming Re publican majorities in the Leg islature said tonight that there was little chance this year of changing New Jersey's 121 year‐old abortion law.  And in another controversial matter, Gov. William T. Cahill moved quickly today to rescue the proposed open‐admissions program at Rutgers, the state university. In the case of the abortion law, a bill that would dras tically change the existing statute was introduced on Mon day in the face of heavy op position in both houses. The proposal, which is prin cipally sponsored by Assembly man William M. Crane, a Ber gen County Republican, would authorize an abortion in New Jersey if the pregnancy re sulted from rape or incest, if the mother was an unmarried girl under 16 years of age, if the mental or physical health of the mother was in danger or if there was a likelihood that the child would be seri ously defective. Defeated in New York These are the same grounds offered in an abortion‐reform bill that was killed last year by the New York Legislature. Under existing New Jersey law, an abortion is illegal un less it is “lawfully justified,” and the only justification sanc tioned thus far by the courts is when the life of the mother is endangered. Every previous effort to re vise the law has been killed here, so little hope was ex pressed for Mr. Crane's pro posal, particularly after Tues day, when Governor Cahill, a Republican and a Roman Catho lic, said he was opposed to any changes on religious grounds. However, Mr. Cahill said his religious convictions would not prevent him from making an independent judgment if the measure ever reached his desk. But Assembly Speaker Wil Ham K. Dickey of Camden, County said he did not think the proposal would pass the Assembly, and Senator Harry L. Sears of Morris County, the Republican majority leader, said he did not think the measure would prevail in his chamber. Nevertheless, Barry T. Parker of Burlington County, the As sembly majority leader, said he hoped to give the measure a full debate on the floor this year. The major opposition to any change comes largely from Ro man Catholic churches and lay organizations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

‘Sisterhood Is Powerful’,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/15/archives/sisterhood-is-powerful-a-member-of-the-womens-liberation-movement.html,"THERE is a small group of women that gathers at my house or at the home of one or another of our 15 members each Sunday evening. Our ages range from the early twen ties to the late forties. As it happens, all of us work for a living, some at jobs we truly like. Some of us are married, with families, and some are not. Some of us knew each other before we joined the group and some did not. Once we are settled on the sofa and the hard‐backed chairs brought in from the kitchen, and the late‐comers have poured their own coffee and arranged themselves as best they can on the floor, we begin our meeting. Each week we explore another aspect of what we consider to be our fundamental oppression in a male‐controlled society. Our con versation is always animated, often emotional. We rarely adjourn before midnight. Although we are pleased with our selves and our insights, we like to remind each other now and then that our small group is not unique. It is merely one of many such groups that have sprung up around the city in the last two years under the umbrella of that collective term, the women's liberation movement. In fact, we had been meeting as a group for exactly four Sundays when one of us got a call from a representative of C.B.S. asking if we would care to be filmed in our natural habitat for a segment on the evening news with Walter Cronkite. We discussed the invitation thoroughly, and then said no. “Women are an oppressed class. Our oppression is total, affecting every facet of our lives. We are exploited as sex objects, breeders, domestic servants and cheap labor. We are considered inferior beings whose only purpose is to enhance men's lives. ...” —REDSTOCKINGS MANIFESTO. “While we realize that the libera tion of women will ultimately mean the liberation of men from the de structive role as oppressor, we have no illusion that men will welcome this liberation without a struggle. ...” —MANIFESTO OF THE NEW YORK RADICAL FEMINISTS. Women's liberation is hot stuff this season, in media terms, and no wonder. In the short space of two years, the new feminism has taken hold and rooted in territory that at first glance appears an unlikely breeding ground for revolutionary ideas: among urban, white, college educated, middle‐class women gener ally considered to be a rather “privi leged” lot by those who thought they knew their politics, or knew their women. From the radical left to the Establishment middle, the women's movement has become a fact of life. The National Organization for Women (NOW), founded by Betty Friedan in 1966, has 35 chapters across the country. Radical feminist groups creators of the concept of women's liberation, as opposed to women's rights—exist in all major cities side by side with their more conservative counterparts. Without doubt, certain fringe as pects of the movement make “good copy,” to use the kindest term avail able for how my brethren in the business approach the subject mat ter. (“Get the bra burning and the karate up front,” an editor I know told a writer I know when preparing one news magazine's women's lib eration story.) But the irony of all this media attention is that while the minions of C.B.S. News can locate a genuine women's liberation group with rela tive ease (they ferreted out our little group before we had memorized each other's last names), hundreds of women in New York City have failed in their attempts to make contact with the movement. I have spoken to women who have spent as much as three months looking for a group that was open to new members. Un claimed letters have piled up at certain post office box numbers hastily set up and thoughtlessly abandoned by here‐today‐and‐gone‐ tomorrow “organizations” that dis appeared as abruptly as they mate rialized. The elusive qualities of “women's lib” once prompted the writer Sally Kempton to remark, “It's not a movement, it's a state of mind.” The surest way to affiliate with the movement these days is to form your own small group. That's the way it's happening. TWO years ago the 50 or so women in New York City who had taken to calling themselves the women's liberation movement met on Thursday evenings at a borrowed office on East 11th Street. The offi cial title of the group was the New York Radical Women. There was some justification at the time for thinking grandly in national terms, for similar groups of women were beginning to form in Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and Washington. New York Radical Women came by its name quite simply: the women were young radicals, mostly under the age of 25, and they come out of the civil rights and/or peace movements, for which many of them had been full time workers. A few years earlier, many of them might have been found on the campuses of Vassar, Radcliffe, Wellesley and the larger coed universities, a past they worked hard to deny. What brought them to gether to a women‐only discussion and action group was a sense of abuse suffered at the hands of the very protest movements that had spawned them. As “movement wom‐ men,” they were tired of doing the typing and fixing the food while “movement men” did the writing and leading. Most were living with or married to movement men who, they be lieved, were treating them as convenient sex objects or as somewhat lesser beings. Widely repeated quotations, such as Stokeley Carmichael's wisecrack dictum to S.N.C.C., “The position of women in our movement should be prone,” and, three years later, a similar observation by Black Panther Eldridge Cleaver had reinforced their uncomfort able suspicion that the social vision of radical men did not include equality for women. Black power, as practiced by black male leaders, appeared to mean that black women would step back while black men stepped forward. The white male radical's eager embrace of machismo ap peared to include those back ward aspects of male supre macy in the Latin culture from which the word mach ismo is derived. Within their one‐to‐one relationships with their men, the women felt, the highly touted “alternate life style” of the radical move ment was working out no bet ter than the “bourgeois” life style they had rejected. If man and wife in a suburban split‐level was a symbol of all that was wrong with plastic, bourgeois America, “man and chick” in a Lower East Side tenement flat was hardly the new order they had dreamed of. In short, “the movement” was reinforcing, not eliminat ing, their deepest insecurities and feelings of worthlessness as women — feelings which quite possibly had brought them into radical protest poli tics to begin with. So, in small way, they had begun to rebel. They had decided to meet regularly—without their men—to talk about their com mon experience. “Our femin ism was very underdeveloped in those days,” says Anne Koedt, an early member of the group. “We didn't have any idea of what kind of ac tion we could take. We couldn't stop talking about the blacks and Vietnam.” IN Marxist canons, “the woman question” is one of many manifestations of a sick, capitalist society which “the revolution” is supposed to finish off smartly. Some of the women who devoted their Thursday evening meeting time to New York Radical Women believed they were merely dusting off and stream lining an orthodox, ideological issue. Feminism was bad politics and a dirty word since it excluded the larger picture. But others in the group. like Anne Koedt and Shuli Firestone, an intense and talkative young activist, had begun to see things from different, heretical perspec tive. Woman's oppressor was Man, they argued, and not a specific economic system. After all, they pointed out, male supremacy was still flourishing in the Soviet Union, Cuba and China, where power was still lodged in a male bureaucracy. Even the beloved Che wrote a guide book for revolutionaries in which he waxed ecstatic over the advantages to a guerrilla movement of having women along in the mountains—to prepare and cook the food. The heretics tentatively put forward the idea that femin ism must be a separate move‐ ment of its own. New York Radical Women's split in perspective—was the ultimate oppressor Man or Capitalism?— occupied end less hours of debate at the Thursday evening meetings. Two warring factions emerged, dubbing each other “the feminists” and “the politicos.” But other things were happen ing as well. For one thing, new women were coming in droves to the Thursday eve ning talk fest, and a growing feeling of sisterhood was permeating the room. Meet ings began awkwardly and shyly, with no recognized chairman and no discernible agenda. Often the suggestion, “Let's sit closer together, sisters,” helped break the ice. But once the evening's initial awkwardness had passed, volubility was never a prob lem. “We had so much to say,” an early member re lates, “and most of us had never said it to another woman before.” Soon how to say it became an important question. Young women like Carol Hanisch, a titian‐haired recruit to the civil rights movement from a farm in Iowa, and her friend Kathie Amatniek, a Radcliffe graduate and a working film editor, had spent over a year in Mississippi working with S.N.C.C. There they had been impressed with the Southern revival‐style mass meeting at which blacks got up and “testified” about their own ex perience with “the Man.” Might the technique also work for women? And wasn”t it the same sort of thing that Mao Tse‐tung had advocated to raise political conscious ness in Chinese villages? As Carol Hanisch reminded the group, Mao”s slogan had been “Speak pain to recall pain”— precisely what New York Radical Women was doing! The personal‐testimony meth od encouraged all women who came to the meeting to speak their thoughts. The tech nique of “going around the room” in turn brought re sponses from many who had never opened their mouths at male‐dominated meetings and were experiencing the same difficulty in a room full of articulate members of their own sex. Specific questions such as, “If you've thought of having a baby, do you want a girl or a boy?” touched off accounts of what it meant to be a girl‐child—the second choice in a society that prizes boys. An examination of “What happens to your rela tionship when your man earns more money than you, and what happens when you earn more money than him?” brought a flood of anecdotes about the male ego and money. “We all told similar stories,” relates a member of the group. “We discovered that, to a man, they all felt challenged if we were the breadwinners. It meant that we were no longer dependent. We had somehow robbed them of their ‘rightful’ role.” “We began to see our ‘fem inization’ as a two‐level proc ess,” says Anne Koedt. “On one level, a woman is brought up to believe that she is a girl and that is her biological des tiny. She isn't suppposed to want to achieve anything. If, by some chance, she manages to escape the psychological damage, she finds that the structure is prohibitive. Even though she wants to achieve, she finds she is discouraged at every turn and she still can't become President.” FEW topics, the women found, were unfruitful. Humili ations that each of them had suffered privately—from being turned down for a job with the comment, “We were look ing for a man,” to catcalls and wolf whistles on the street— turned out to be universal agonies. “I had always felt degraded, actually turned into an object,” said one woman. “I was no longer a human be ing when a guy on the street would start to make those in credible animal noises at me. I never was flattered by it, I always understood that behind that whistle a masked hostility. When we started to talk about it in the group, discovered that every woman in the room had similar feel ings. None of us knew how to cope with this street hostility. We had always had to grin and bear it. We had always been told to dress as women, to be very sexy and alluring to men, and what did it get us? Comments like ‘Look at the legs on that babe’ and ‘would I like to — her.’ On Man‐Hating “Man‐hating has been the cause of a deep rift within Women's Libera tion. It is a vital issue be cause it involves ultimate ly the way we feel about ourselves, and how far we are willing to go in our own behalf. I've been at meetings where women actually left because they thought that ‘man‐haters’ were on the loose. All ar guments which tend to suppress the recognition of man‐hating in our midst are reducible to this: FEAR. Man‐hating is con sidered a subversive and therefore dangerous senti ment. Men, who control the definition, have made of it a disgusting perver sion. Many men engage in sexual intercourse, often extensively, even marry, while hating women. These men are called misogyn ists. Now, there is no shame in being a misogy nist. It is a perfectly re spectable attitude. Our whole society (including too many of the women in it) hates women. Per haps we need a Latin or Greek derivative in place of ‘man‐hating’ to make the perfect symmetry of the two attitudes more obvious.” —Pamela Kearon, a mem ber of The Feminists. “Consciousness ‐ raising,” in which a woman's personal ex *My small group has dis cussed holding a street action of our own on the first warm day of spring.

The confrontation, we feel, will be educational for all con cerned. perience at the hands of men was analyzed as a political phenomenon, soon became a keystone of the women's liberation movement. IN 1963, before there was a women's movement, Betty Friedan published what eventually became an Ameri can classic, “The Feminine Mystique.” The book was a brilliant, factual examination of the post‐World War II “back to the home” movement that tore apart the myth of the fulfilled and happy American housewife. Though “The Femi nine Mystique” held an un questioned place as the intel lectual mind‐opener for most of the young feminists—de Beau vales “The Second Sex,” a broad, philosophical analysis of the cultural restraints on women, was runner‐up in pop ularity—few members of New York Radical Women had ever felt motivated to attend a meeting of Friedan's National Organization for Women, the parliamentary‐style organiza tion of professional women and housewives that she founded in 1966. Friedan, the mother of the movement, and the organization that re cruited in her image were considered hopelessly bour geois. NOW's emphasis on legislative change left the radicals cold. The generation gap created real barriers to communication. “Actually, we had a lot in common with the NOW women,” reflects Anne Koedt. “The women who started NOW were achievement oriented in their professions. They began with the employ ment issue because that's what they were up against. The ones who started New York Radical Women were achievement‐oriented in the radical movement. From both ends we were fighting a male structure that prevented us from achieving.” Friedan's book had not en visioned a movement of young feminists emerging from the college campus and radical politics. “If I had it to do all over again,” she says, “I would rewrite my last chapter.” She came to an early meeting of New York Radical Women to listen, ask questions and take notes, and went away convinced that her approach—and NOW's— was more valid. “As far as I'm concerned, we're still the radicals,” she says emphat ically. “We raised our con sciousness a long time ago. I get along with the women's lib people because they're the way the troops we need come up. But the name of the game is confrontation and action, and equal is the gut issue. The legal fight is enormously important. De segregating The New York Times help‐wanted ads was an important step, don't you think? And NOW did it. The women's movement needs its Browns versus Boards of Education.” “The goals of women's liberation go beyond a simple concept of equality” Other older women, writers and lifetime feminists, also came around to observe, and stayed to develop a kinship with girls young enough to be their daughters. “I almost wept after my first meeting. I went home and filled my diary,” says Ruth Hersch berger, poet and author of “Adam's Rib,” a witty and unheeded expostulation of women's rights published in 1948. “When I wrote ‘Adam's Rib,’ I was writing for readers who wouldn't accept the first premise. Now there was a whole roomful of people and a whole new vocabulary. could go a whole month on the ammunition I'd get at one meeting.” IN June of 1968, New York Radical Women produced a mimeographed booklet of some 20 pages entitled “Notes from the First Year.” It sold for 50 cents to women and $1.00 to men. “Notes” was a compendium of speeches, essays and transcriptions of tape‐recorded “rap sessions” of the Thursday evening group on such subjects as sex, abortion and orgasm. Several mimeographed editions later, it remains the most widely circulated source material on the New York women's liber ation movement. The contribution to “Notes” that attracted the most atten tion from both male and female readers was a one‐ page essay by Anne Koedt entitled, “The Myth of Vaginal Orgasm.” In it she wrote: “Frigidity has generally been defined by men as the failure of women to have vaginal orgasms. Actually, the vagina is not a highly sensitive area and is not physiologically constructed to achieve orgasm. The clitoris is the sensitive area and is the female equivalent of the penis. All orgasms [in women] are extensions of sensations from this area. This leads to some interesting questions about conventional sex and our role in it. Men have orgasms essentially by friction with the vagina, not with the clitoris. Women have thus been defined sexually in terms of what pleases men; our own biology has not been properly analyzed. Instead we have been fed a myth of the liberated woman and her vaginal orgasm, an orgasm which in fact does not exist. What we must do is redefine our sexuality. We must dis card the ‘normal’ concepts of sex and create new guidelines which take into account mutual sexual enjoyment. We must begin to demand that if a certain sexual position or technique now defined as ‘standard’ is not mutually conducive to orgasm, then it should no longer be defined as standard.” Anne Koedt's essay went further than many other wom en in the movement would have preferred to go, but she was dealing with a subject that every woman understood. “For years I suffered under a male‐imposed definition of my sexual responses,” one woman says. “From Freud on down, it was men who set the standard of my sexual en joyment. Their way was the way I should achieve nirvana, because their way was the way it worked for them. Me? Oh, I was simply an ‘inade quate woman.’” BY September, 1968, New York Radical Women felt strong enough to attempt a major action. Sixty women went to Atlantic City hi char tered buses to picket the Miss America pageant. The beauty contest was chosen as a tar get because of the ideal of American womanhood it ex tolled—vacuous, coiffed, cos meticized and with a smidgin of talent. But New York Radical Wom en did not survive its second year. For one thing, the num ber of new women who flocked to the Thursday eve ning meetings made con sciousness‐raising and “going around the room” an impossi bility. The politico‐feminist split and other internal con flicts—charges of “domina tion” by one or another of the stronger women were thrown back and forth—put a damper on the sisterly euphoria. An attempt to break up the one large group into three smaller ones—by lot— proved disastrous. Several women felt the need for a new group. They had become intrigued with the role of the witch in world his tory as representing society's persecution of women who flared to be different. From Joan of Arc, who dared to wear men's clothes and lead a men's army, to the women of Salem who dared to defy accepted political, religious mores, the “witch” was pun ished for deviations. Out of this thinking grew WITCH, a handy acronym that the or ganizers announced, half tongue‐in‐cheek, stood for Women's International Ter rorist Conspiracy from Hell. Much of WITCH was al ways tongue‐in‐cheek, and from its inception its mem bers were at great pains to deny that they were feminists. The Yippie movement had made outrageous disruption a respectable political tactic of the left, and the women of WITCH decided it was more compatible with their think ing to be labeled “kooks” by outsiders than to be labeled man‐haters by movement men. In the WITCH philosophy, the patriarchy of the nuclear family was synonymous with the patriarchy of the Amer ican business corporation. Thus, four women took jobs at a branch of the Travelers Insurance Company, where a fifth member was working, and attempted to establish a secret coven of clerical work ers on the premises. (For the Travelers' project, WITCH be came “Women Incensed at Travelers' Corporate Hell.”) In short order, the infiltrators were fired for such infractions of office rules as wearing slacks to work. Undaunted, a new quintet of operatives gained employment in the vast typing pools at A.T. & T. “Women Into Telephone Com pany Harassment” gained three sympathizers to the cause before Ma Bell got wise and exorcised the coven from her midst. Two Witches were fired for insubordina tion; the rest were smoked out and dismissed for being “overqualified” for the typing pool. WITCH's spell over the women's movement did not hold. “At this point,” says Judith Duffet, an original member, “you could say that WITCH is just another small group in women's liberation. We're concerned with con sciousness‐raising and devel oping an ideology through collective thinking. We don't do the freaky, hippie stuff any more.” WHILE WITCH was brew ing its unusual recipe for lib eration, another offshoot of New York Radical Women emerged. The new group was called Redstockings, a play on bluestockings, with the blue re placed by the color of revolu tion. Organized by Shuli Fire stone and Ellen Willis, an articulate rock‐music colum nist for the New Yorker and a serious student of Engels's “Origins of the Family,” Red stockings made no bones about where it stood. It was firmly committed to feminism and action. Redstockings made its first public appearance at a New York legislative hearing on abortion law reform in Febru ary, 1969, when several women sought to gain the microphone to testify about their own abortions. The hear ing, set up to take testimony from 15 medical and psychi atric “experts” —14 were men—was hastily adjourned. The following month, Red stockings held its own abor tion hearing at the Washing ton Square Methodist Church. Using the consciousness‐rais ing technique, 12 women “testified” about abortion, from their own personal expe rience, before an audience of 300 men and women. The political message of the emotion‐charged evening was that women were the only true experts on unwanted pregnancy and abortion, and that every woman has an in alienable right to decide whether or not she wishes to bear a child. Redstockings' membership counts are a closely held secret, but I would estimate that the number does not ex ceed 100. Within the move ment, Redstockings push what they call “the pro woman line.” “What it means,” says a member, “is that we take the woman's side in everything. A woman is never to blame for her own submission. None of us need to change ourselves, we need to change men.” Redstockings are also devout about con sciousness‐raising. “Whatever else we may do, conscious ness‐raising is the ongoing political work,” says Kathie Amatniek. For the last few months, the various Redstock ing groups have been raising their consciousness on what they call “the divisions be tween women that keep us apart”—married women vs. single, black women vs. white, middle class vs. working class, etc. While Redstockings organ ized its abortion speak‐out, the New York chapter of NOW formed a committee to lobby for repeal of restrictive abortion legislation. These dissimilar approaches to the same problem illustrate the difference in style between the two wings of the women's movement. BUT within New York NOW itself, a newer, wilder brand of feminism made an appear ance. Ti‐Grace Atkinson, a Friedan protegee and the president of New York NOW, found herself in increasing conflict with her own local chapter and Friedan over NOW's hierarchical structure a typical organization plan with an executive board on top. Ti‐Grace, a tall blonde who has been described in print as “aristocratic look ing,” had come to view the power relationship between NOW's executive board and the general membership as a copycat extension of the standard forms of male domi nation over women in the so ciety at large. She proposed to NOW that all executive offices be abolished in favor of rotat ing chairmen chosen by lot from the general membership. When Atkinson's proposal came up for, a vote by the general membership of the New York chapter in October, 1968, and was defeated, Ti Grace resigned her presidency on the spot and went out and formed her own organization. Named the October 17th Movement — the date of Ti Grace's walkout from NOW— it made a second debut this summer as The Feminists, and took its place as the most radical of the women's liber ation groups. (New York NOW suffered no apparent effects from its first organiza tional split. Over the last year it has gained in membership as feminism has gained ac ceptabilty among wider cir‐ cles of women.) The Feminists made anti elitism and rigorous discipline cardinal principles of their organization. As the only radical feminist group to take a stand against the institution of marriage they held a sit in at the city marriage license bureau last year, rais ing the slogan that “Marriage Is Slavery.” Married women or women living with men may not exceed one‐third of the total membership. Differences over such mat ters as internal democracy, and the usual personality con flicts that plague all political movements, caused yet an other feminist group and another manifesto to make their appearance this fall. In November, Shuli Firestone and Anne Koedt set up a plan for organizing small groups— or “brigades,” as they prefer to call them—on a neighbor hood basis, and named their over‐all structure the New York Radical Feminists. Eleven decentralized neigh borhood units (three are in the West Village) meet jointly once a month. The Radical Feminists co exist with the Feminists and the Redstockings without much rivalry, although when pressed, partisans of the vari ous groups will tell you, for instance, that Redstockings do too much consciousness raising and not enough action, or that the Feminists are “fascistic,” or that the Radi cal Feminists are publicity hungry. But in general, since interest in the women's liber ation movement has always exceeded organizational ca pacity, the various groups take the attitude of “the more the merrier.” DESPITE the existence of three formal “pure radical feminist” organizations, hun dreds of women who consider themselves women's liber ationists have not yet felt the need to affiliate with any body larger than their own small group. The small group, averaging 8 to 15 members and organized spontaneously by friends calling friends has become the organizational form of the amorphous move ment. Its intimacy seems to suit women. Fear of express ing new or half‐formed thoughts vanishes in a friend ly living‐room atmosphere. “After years of psycho analysis in which my doctor kept telling me my problem was that I wouldn't accept quote—my female role,” says a married woman with two children who holds a master's degree in philosophy, “the small group was a revelation to me. Suddenly, for the first time in my life, it was O.K. to express feelings of hostil ity to men.” Says another woman: “In the small group I have the courage to think things and feel feelings, that I would never have dared to think and feel as an indi‐ vidual.” THE meetings have often been compared to group therapy, a description that most of the women find irri tating. “Group therapy isn't political and what we're doing is highly political,” is the gen eral response. In an early paper on the nature and func tion of the small group, Carol Hanisch once wrote, “Group therapy implies that we are sick and messed up, but the first function of the small group is to get rid of self blame. We start with the assumption that women are really ‘neat’ people. Therapy means adjusting. We desire to change the objective con‐ ditions.” The groups are usually leaderless and structureless, and the subjects discussed at the weekly meetings run the gamut of female experience. The Radical Feminists offer to new groups they organize a list of consciousness‐raising topics that includes: • Discuss your relation ships with men. Have you noticed any recurring pat terns? • Have you ever felt that men have pressured you into sexual relationships? Have you ever lied about orgasm? • Discuss your relation ships with other women. Do you compete with women for men? • Growing up as a girl, were you treated differently from your brother? • What would you most like to do in life? What has stopped you? “Three months of this sort of thing,” says Shuli Fire stone, “is enough to make a feminist out of any woman.” THE kind of collective thinking that has come out of the women's liberation move ment is qualitatively different from the kinds of theorems and analyses that other politi cal movements have gener ated. “Women are different from all other oppressed classes,” says Anne Koedt. “We live in isolation, not in ghettos, and we are in the totally unique position of hav ing a master in our own houses.” It is not surprising, therefore, that marriage and child care are two subjects that receive intensive scrutiny in the small group. If few in the women's movement are willing to go as far as the Feminists and say that marriage is slavery, it is hard to find a women's liber ationist who is not in some way disaffected by the sound of wedding bells. Loss of per sonal identity and the division of labor within the standard marriage (the husband's role as provider, the wife's role as home maintenance and child care) are the basic points at issue. “I have come to view marriage as a built‐in self destruct for women,” says one divorcee after 12 years of marriage. “I married early, right after college, because it was expected of me. I never had a chance to discover who I was. I was programed into the housewife pattern.” Many married women's liberation ists will no longer use their husbands' last names; some have gone back to their maiden names, and some even to their mothers' maiden names. One paper that has been widely circulated within the movement is entitled “The Politics of Housework,” by Pat Mainardi, a Redstocking who is a teacher and painter. “Men recognize the essential fact of housework right from the beginning,” she wrote. “Which is that it stinks. You both work, you both have careers, but you are expected to do the housework. Your husband tells you, ‘Don't talk to me about housework. It's too trivial to discuss’ MEAN ING: His purpose is to deal with matters of significance. Your purpose is to deal with matters of insignificance. So you do the housework. House work trivial? Just try getting him to share the burden. The measure of his resistance is the measure of your oppres‐ sion.” Not only the oppression of housework, but the oppression of child care has become a focus of the women's move ment. Much of the energy of young mothers in the move ment has gone into setting up day‐care collectives that are staffed on an equal basis by mothers and fathers. (Thus far they have proved difficult to sustain.) “Some of the men have actually come to under stand that sharing equally in child care is a political re sponsibility,” says Rosalyn Baxandall, a social worker and an early women's libera tionist.

 nursery on the Lower East Side where their 2‐year‐old, Finn, is charter member. In November, at the Con gress to Unite Women, a con ference that drew over 500 women's liberationists of vari ous persuasions from the New York area, a resolution de manding 24‐hour‐a‐day child care centers was overwhelm ingly endorsed. Women in the movement have also sug gested plans for a new kind of life style in which a husband and wife would each work half‐day and devote the other half of the day to caring for their children. Another pos sibility would be for the man to work for six months of the year while the woman takes care of the child‐rearing re sponsibilities—with the roles reversed for the next six months. THE “movement women” who did not endorse the sep aratism of an independent radical feminist movement last year and chose to remain in what the feminists now call “the male left” have this year made women's liberation a major issue in their own po litical groups. Even the weatherwomen of Weather man meet separately to dis cuss how to combat male chauvinism among their fel low revolutionaries. The wo men of Rat, the farthest out of the underground radical newspapers, formed a collec tive and took over editorial management of their paper last month, charging that their men had put out a prod uct filled with sexist, women as ‐ degraded‐ object pornog raphy. Twenty ‐ two ‐ year ‐ old Jane Alpert, free on bail and facing conspiracy charges for a series of terrorist bombings, was spokesman for the Rat women's putsh. A black wo men's liberation committee functions within S.N.C.C., and its leader, Frances M. Beal, has said publicly, “To be black and female is double jeopardy, the slave of a slave.” The new feminism has moved into some surprisingly Establishment quarters. A spirited women's caucus at New York University Law School forced the university to open its select national scholarship program to wo men students. Women's cau cuses exist among the edito rial employes at McGraw Hill and Newsweek. Last month, 59 women in city government, sent a petition to Mayor Lind say demanding that he active ly seek qualified women for policy‐making posts. THE movement is a story without an end, because it has just begun. The goals of liberation go beyond a simple concept of equality. Looking through my notebook, I see them expressed simply and directly. Betty Friedan: “We're going to redefine the sex roles.” Anne Koedt: “We're going to be redefining poli tics.” Brave words for a new movement, and braver still for a movement that has been met with laughter and hos tility. Each time a man sloughs off the women's move ment with the comment, “They're nothing but a bunch of lesbians and frustrated bitches,” we quiver with col lective rage. How can such a charge be answered in ra tional terms? It cannot be. (The supersensitivity of the movement to the lesbian is sue, and the existence of a few militant lesbians within the movement once prompted Friedan herself to grouse about “the lavender menace” that was threatening to warp the image of women's rights. A lavender herring, perhaps, but surely no clear and pres ent danger.) The small skirmishes and tugs of war that used to be called “the battle of the sexes” have now assumed ideological proportions. It is the aim of the movement to turn men around, and the im plications in that aim are staggering. “Men have used us all their lives as ego fod der,” says Anne Koedt. “They not only control economics and the government, they con trol us. There are the women's pages and the rest of the world.” It is that rest of the world, of course, that we are concerned with. There is women's rights button that sometimes wear and the slo gan on it reads, “Sisterhood is Powerful.” If sisterhood were powerful, what a differ‐ ent world it would be. Women as a class have never subjugated another group; we have never marched off to wars of conquest in the name of the fatherland. We have never been involved in a decision to annex the terri tory of a neighboring country, or to fight for foreign mar kets on distant shores. Those are the games men play, not us. We see it differently. We want to be neither oppressor nor oppressed. The women's revolution is the final revolu tion of them all. How does a sympathetic man relate to a feminist woman? Thus far, it has not been easy for those who are trying. The existence of a couple of men's conscious ness‐raising groups—the par ticipants are mostly husbands of activist women—is too new to be labeled a trend. “When our movement gets strong, when men are forced to see us as a conscious issue, what are they going to do?” asks Anne Koedt. And then she answers: “I don't know, but I think there's a part of men that really wants a human rela tionship," and that's going to be the saving grace for all of us.” ■ """,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CHURCH COUNCIL REVIEWS POLICIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/15/archives/church-council-reviews-policies-group-here-is-seeking-to-represent.html,"A year ago, the old New York Protestant Council changed its name to the New York Council of Churches and invited delegates who represent Eastern Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism. The New York Ro man Catholic Archdiocese sent one observer to the council's first meeting.  Tomorrow, when the Council of Churches holds its first an nual meeting in Riverside Church, 28 Catholic observers are expected to attend—a sign that the body's prospects for becoming genuinely ecumenical are good. At the same time, the coun cil is making basic reassess ments of long‐standing policies concerning abortion and state aid to education in deference to the new Catholic presence, and critics among liberal white and black Protestants say this as evidence thattan ecumenical or ganization must inevitably be ineffectual. “A conciliar structure has to water everything down to the most common denominator,” said the Rev. Howard Moody, pastor of Judson Memorial Church and one of a “network,” of liberal ministers who find it preferable to organize around separate issues. With other white clergymen who have in the past accused the comparatively conservative Protestant Council of being “a social meeting for the good guys,” Mr. Moody sees the for mation of an ecumenical body as an attempt to extend the life of the otherwise “irrelevant” Protestant organization. Disavows Need for Voice “I'm not concerned any more that somebody speak for Protes tantism in this city,” he said. “We've got to learn to become a small minority with a modi cum of grace.” On the other hand, officials of the Council of Churches in sist that as the only elective body, representing 650 of the city's 1,866 Protestant churches, the council is vital to religious life here. “There have been attempts at forming an alternative struc ture but none of them have come off,” said the Rev. Dan M. Potter, executive director of the council. “Eventually you get back to the fact that your or ganization has to be represen tative.” Even within the council, how ever, there is some feeling that it is not nearly as representa tive as it should be of the more than two million Protestants here, and has failed to become a servant of the overwhelming majority of Protestants who are black. “I'd like to see the council become a leader and instigator of social change,” said a coun cil executive who asked not to be identified. “At the moment it isn't even a reflector.” Whites Wield Power The crux of the problem is that since the early nineteen forties, when the Protestant Council was formed, there has been a complete turnaround in the makeup of the Protestant population. There had been half a million blacks and a million and a half whites. Now the figures are the opposite, but the whites still wield most of the power. Strong efforts are under way to change this, dictated at least partially by the fact that white Protestantism no longer has a clear financial advantage. Even among the so‐called “avenue” churches of mid‐Manhattan, drop in contributions is forcing a dip into endowments. According to the Rev. Leland E. Gartrell, director of the Coun cil of Churches' department of church planning and research, more than half the congrega tions in the city “are struggling for their existence.” By contrast, the added, “It is fair to say that the black con gregations are undergoing a healthier financial trend than the majority of the white con gregations.” Among many activist black clergymen, the possibility of building an alternate structure remains appealing. One such al ternative may be the Interfaith Citywide Coordinating Commit tee Against Poverty, an organi zation formed as an agency for youth work that is seeking to expand. Its head, the Rev. James Blake, has been asking churches to divert their contributions from the Council of Churches to his agency but the response has so far been limited. There are other blacks, how ever, who feel that their in fluence is being increasingly felt by the Council of Churches and who believe that a break through by the activists is at hand. The Rev. M. L. Wilson, president of the council and president of the National Com mittee of Black Churchmen, said he thought blacks could make an impact on the “crusty” organization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The World,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/15/archives/the-world-us-and-russia-the-argument-in-clearspeak-on-arms-on-the.html,"WASHINGTON—Fourteen months have passed since President Nixon proclaimed the nation's passage from the era of confronta tion to the era of negotiation with the Soviet Union. But the fact is, as Moscow's Pravda noted indirectly last week, that the super powers remain engaged in a confusing pat tern of confrontation and negotiation both, with a little procrastination thrown in for good measure.  They are, albeit reluctantly, on a collision course in the Middle East but talking about it. They are, at least by proxy, at war in Vietnam and incapable of collaboration even to enforce their joint agreement on a neutral Laos. They are more or less behaving themselves at the points of face‐to‐face con frontation across Europe but unable to move toward a more stable security arrangement. They are wondering and worrying about what each intends to do about about Communist China. And they are negotiating, vaguely but seriously, about how to limit the nuclear arms race. Not much of a new era, but not hopeless either. One of the brighter rays of hope was that Pravda editorial on the subject of arms control. Though it questioned the motives of “some” American “imperialists” and tried, in part, to influence the pending Congressional debate on the antimissile system, the newspaper's virtually official commentary offered an important message to both foreign and domestic audiences. It said another round of nuclear arms de ployment would, not affect the basic power balance and might, indeed, make the Soviet Union more vulnerable to American illusions of superiority. It thus proclaimed officially Moscow's serious interest in an agreement and, moreover, one that would give neither side an advantage over the other. Even in pleading with President Nixon to restrain the tough talk of his Secretary of Defense, Melvin R. Laird, Pravda offered rare praise for the “well‐intentioned official speeches” on arms control by others here. Mr. Laird's harping on the Soviet “threat” and his proposals for further arms develop ment, it said, were causing concern about American intentions. But the editorial could be read also as reassurance to Soviet Nervous Nellies that, Pentagon rhetoric notwithstand ing, the Russian people stand to gain a lot by remaining serious about these negotia tions. Such are the difficulties of breaking out of the cocoons of suspicion and hostility and out of the confusing and often misleading rhetoric of a generation on every major issue. On Arms In facing up to arms control, both sides are balancing the burden of always bigger and better and more expensive weapons against the conviction that national survival must be deemed cheap at any price. At this juncture, reduced to a kind of clearspeak, the rival positions appear to be as follows: United States: After years of “superiority” over you in the numbers and types of nuclear weapons, we admit that more expensive su periority of that kind, won't really bring more security for us. So why not stop where we are—roughly equal? We're glad the explora tory round of talks went so well; your con cepts and ours about limiting the race seem similar enough. But we are very worried about those supermissiles you've been mass producing in the last year. You don't need them against our cities, so you must be aim ing at our missiles, which means you are trying to get into a position to wipe out our retaliatory force before we could ever re taliate. Keep that up and we'll really have to go big on antimissiles and multiheaded missiles aimed at your missiles. Then, even if agreement is still technically possible, we'll never get everyone in our Government to trust you in any kind of deal. Or the agree ment will get so complicated it will require us to look into the nosecones of the multi headed monsters and you know how skittish you get when we bring up inspection. So let's get on with relatively simple agreement limit ing the size of ABM's and the number of missile lauchers. Soviet Union: We're glad that you finally recognize us as equals in this business so that we can talk about an agreement in which you won't simply try to freeze your own sense of superiority. But as you know, we still have some catching up to do on nuclear submarines and the multiheaded missiles Which you have managed to make more so phisticated and sooner than we. You've got your nerve worrying about our supermissiles. And we notice you keep wanting to expand the antimissile system, on one pretext after another, without even waiting for our talks to proceed and you're talking about building new bombers and putting multiheads on sea as well as land missiles, as if to foreclose certain types of agreement. If you think we are skittish about inspection, what must we think about your military‐indusrial complex, which sees itself threatened by any limitation on arms spending? We have worried generals, too, you know, even though we gag them a little better than you. On the Middle East There are both direct conflicts of interest and greater difficulties for each side in coping with client‐allies: United States: If we don't watch out, the Arabs and Israelis will entrap us both into a military conflict that neither of us wants. We don't deny your interests in the region, but neither will we let you exploit the situation to deny the West all friendship and commerce with the Arabs. We've tem porarily delayed the promise of more planes to Israel and gotten into a lot of trouble with Israel and her friends by proposing compro mise formulas for a settlement, but now it's your turn to lean on Cairo for a while. Soviet Union: Frankly, the tension in the Middle East has helped us regain some standing with the Arabs since we let them go down to defeat in the six‐day war. We don't want a big‐power clash either but if we can control Cairo while increasing Arab depen dence on us, the Western position is bound to erode further. We'll, try to help get a settlement provided it yields us the credit for moving the Israelis back from the occupied territories. So we will encourage you to come up with, more concessions, until we see some that we can sell to Cairo as a pretty good deal. On Southeast Asia On Laos, which was the subject last week of a new American entreaty to Moscow, neither power has been able to disengage from the adversary relationship provoked by the situation in Vietnam: United States: We have offered some dip lomatic concessions in Paris and we are at least gradually moving our troops out of South Vietnam, but you have not used any of your military aid to Hanoi to help us get out on some honorable basis. This obviously clouds our whole relationship. Can't you at least get the North Vietnamese to go easy in Laos, which only complicates the Ameri can involvement in Southeast Asia? Soviet Union: Now, that you have stopped bombing North Vietnam we are no longer in the path of fire and the war is costing us only money. You cannot, therefore, ex pect us to risk further loss of leadership in the Communist world by forcing our ally to yield to efforts to win in settlement what you have not won on the battlefield. We don't care who runs South Vietnam and we certainly don't care about Laos, but there's not much we can or want to do about that heroic little people in North Vietnam. On Berlin Though new East‐West talks are in the offing, they promise little at present: United States: Now that Europe is calm and you are worried about your eastern flank and the two Germanys are moving closer to gether, why not eliminate the sore spot of Berlin by negotiating a stable system of ac cess for us? And why not move from there to consider a mutual reduction of our troops in Western and Eastern Europe? Soviet Union: Okay, let's talk, but the price of a permanent Berlin settlement remains per manent acceptance of the East German Com munist regime, headquartered in East Berlin. As for the troops, we keep ours in Eastern Europe to prevent defections among our allies, not because we are worried about yours. Since there is pressure on you to reduce the European forces, we think we'll just wait and see what happens. On China Virtually unspoken, though a major factor in all these rival calculations, are the inter ests of both powers in future relations with Peking: Soviet Union: With a billion people stretched along a huge frontier in our rear and develop ing nuclear weapons and harboring serious grievances against us, we had better shores up our relations on other fronts so that we can get through a tense decade or two. It might even come to direct conflict and we would not want the Americans or Germans or others to be taking advantage of our preoccupation. United States: Peace with you is our fore most interest, but we have no insoluble con flict with China. So it is time to encourage Peking, now that she may want some friends, to come out of her shell and play a more active role in world affairs. If you are wor ried about Peking and Washington ganging up on the Soviet Union, well, that's not our intent, but perhaps you will be more reason able in others matters if we do worry you bit. Life is ambiguous. —MAX FRANKEL The World CONTINUED Israel's Outposts: Are They Foreclosing An Accord? JERUSALEM — The six‐day war was hardly 24 hours old when Israeli leaders were as suring foreign diplomats that they had not gone to war to acquire territory. Before the week had ended, however, the Israelis were saying they would never return to their old borders. The two statements were not contradictory. Nothing could have been more real for Israelis than the feeling in early June of 1967 of impending military dis aster. No one here, and few abroad, saw it as anything but a defensive war. But the relief that swept over the nation with its quick and decisive victory was accompanied by a resolve that some adjustments would have to be made, both politically and geographically. What were the changes to be? With Arab leaders too weak to negotiate, could Israel make the necessary adjustments them selves? Three years after the war, with peace talks out of the question, these issues continue to plague the nation. Some adjustments have been made. Tordanian Jerusalem has been annexed to bar its redivi sion and the Golan Heights have been staked out as a necessary strategic acquisition. Israelis are living in 21 settlements in the occupied areas‐11 of them in the Golan Heights.. Another nine will be established by the end of 1971. Allon's New Idea Nine of the functioning settle ments are nahals, or paramili tary outposts, which the Israelis claim they can abandon if neces sary. Some doubt it. The others are civilian settlements in areas that Israel intends to keep—the Golan Heights and border sec tors of the West Bank. Last week, though, Deputy Premier Yigal Allon suggested something new. He said the cab inet was studying the feasibility of a Jewish “suburb” in Hebron, a major West Bank city and one with a reputation for anti‐Jew ish feelings. Mr. Allon said a master plan would be completed in two weeks and the Cabinet would then decide whether to go ahead. If tile decision is yes (the previous government failed to reach a decision three times), planning would take a year. The proposal would establish the first Jewish settlement in an Arab urban area. It would also go a long way, some feel, to ward foreclosing the return of the West Bank to Jordan, or at least its southern half. Oppo nents of the Hebron plan—and of other such plans—say the establishment by Israel of settle ments in occupied areas carries heavy psychological weight, and this weight is a major burden for those still seeking a way to peace. This was evident within hours of Mr. Allon's statement when a member of the left‐wing Mapam party, debating a right‐wing ad herent of the Hebron settlement argued bitterly that Israel was losing all her options. This view is held by others, although a minority. They can be found in small numbers in industry, the universities and in the Knesset, especially in the Mapam party. Mapam's Ideological leaders were East European Jews who came here decades ago, many from Russia, to develop the Kib butz as a way of life, They were Socialists, but parted from Moscow's lead many years ago. They argue now against the faits accompli they say the gov ernment is crating with the establishment of certain settle ments. Other members of the government, probably including Foreign Minister Abba Eban, may agree with them. Those who favor settling the occupied areas range from ex pansionists who see the “land of Israel” extending beyond the cease‐fire lines to hard‐headed pragmatists who offer some in teresting arguments. They say, for example, that options are kept open by settling Jews in places like Hebron. Once Israel decides firmly that there is to be no such settlement, the Arabs know the area is to be returned, these advocates say. They also say that plans for such settlement might encourage the Arabs to negotiate on the theory that the longer they wait the less there will be to ne gotiate. And once a treaty is established, they add, there should be no reason why a Jew ish‐owned factory or a Jewish suburb could not exist in Arab territories because the only peace Israel would agree to would be one calling for nor malization. But the fact is that Israeli settlements become permanent and the land between the settle ments becomes Israeli. The ci vilian outposts are certainly go ing to stay and the paramilitary ones would not be lightly given up in any negotiation, no matter what the political argument for their temporary nature. They also point the way to political decisions. Among the eight new settlements planned for this year, for example, are two in the southern, end of the Gaza Strip. Acquisition of this territory has been the Israeli intention since the six‐day war, but staking outposts in it seems to make the intention a fact. The Arabs find in these ac tions support for their declara tion, that the only way to regain lost lands is by force, even if it takes centuries. The Israelis lis ten to these declarations and find justification fos the border outposts that will serve as their first line of defense. ‐JAMES FERON Attack on Makarios Revives Old Fears In Cyprus/ NICOSIA—'They have mur dered me but I have not died,” President Makarios declared in a complicated bit of rhetoric to a cheering crowd In Famagusta five days after he was literally shot out of the sky by would‐be assassins. The question Cypriotes and foreign observers, are asking these days runs the other way. Not having died, has the arch bishop been politically murdered. The rifle and machine gun fire aimed at President Makarios's helicopter from the roof of his old high school, the Pan Cypriote gymnasium, missed him by only a few inches. The pilot, wounded gravely in the stomach, managed to bring the helicopter down safely. First Reaction The first reaction throughout the island — among the Greek Cypriotes for whom President Makarios is both national leader and head of the church, the Turks in their barbed wire pro tected enclaves, the United Na tions forces which patrol the truce between the two, and the big foreign embassies which would find themselves plunged into a second Middle East crisis should the truce break down— was relief. Since 1963, when bloody riot ing broke out between Cyprus's 80 per cent Greek majority and its 20 per cent Turkish minority, the two communities have been separated. The Turks live in a series of enclaves, govern them selves, receive financial and mili tary support from Ankara and play no part in the Cyprus Goveminent. After a second crisis in 1967, tension was eased by Greece's and Turkey's decision to encourage their respective Cypriote communities to quiet things down. Any suspicion of Turkish re sponsibility in the Makarios at tempt would have wrecked the relative stability of the past 18 months and led to new warfare. But the Greek Cypriotes' search in their own ranks for the cul prits, though less explosive, of fers dangerous possibilities too. The 14 men being held by the police are a collection of gun men and extremists belonging to different armed, semi‐clandestine groups that remained in Cyprus after independence had been won. The membership of these groups favors Enosis, or union with Greece, which was frus trated by the adamant opposi tion of Turkey and the Turk Cypriotes, and the compromise solution of independence. Al though Archbishop Makarios himself favors Enosis as an ulti mate goal, he is regarded by the extreme Enosists as a traitor for settling for independence. One of the main theories regarding the assassination at tempt is that it was an effort by the Enosists, assisted or en couraged by mainland Greek of ficers staffing the Cypriote Na tional Guard, to remove the man who, whatever his eventual hopes, stands as the symbol for Cypriote independence. Cypriotes divide over this theory — as on all of the theories available — into 100 per cent positive it is true and 100 percent positive‐it is false. The second main theory ascribes the attempt to Poly carpos Georghiades, a redoubt able independence fighter‐who became Interior and Defense Minister but‐ was subsequently ousted by President Makarios. Mr. Georghiades has his own band of armed men and, powerful friends in the police. Further more, the enmity between him and the archbishop has reached obsessive proportions. On Friday night, Mr. Geor ghiades was prevented by police from taking a plane to Beirut, although he was not placed under any other restriction. Should either theory prove correct, a dangerous situation would be created. Any accusation against Greek officers, along with the assumption that they could not have acted without encouragement from at least some members of the Greek junta, would place President Makarios in a delicate position. An accusation against Mr. Georgadzis, on the other hand, would badly hurt his political as sociate Glafkos Clerides, a mod erate who is the most respected Greek Cypriote after President Makarios and, in a peculiarly Cypriote intricacy, both a politi cal rival of the archbishop's and his principal lieutenant. There have been no major re percussions on the Turkish side so far. But relations between the two sides have been put under a new and worrying strain. Any major upheaval on the Greek Cypriote side —a loss of control by the archbishop, evi dence that Greek officers were plotting to advance Enosis, or an upsurge of terrorist activity that could end in attacks on Turkish villages — would quickly push the latent and un solved Cyprus problem back to the brink of war between Greece and Turkey. —RICHARD EDER The World CONTINUED How to tower the Profile While Giving Aid Senator J. W. Fulbright, once one of the strongest Congres sional supporters of the United States foreign aid program but more recently one of Its sharpest critics, wrote in a recent letter to The New York Times: “I willingly restate my own personal commitment to give full support to an expanded aid pro gram under international man agement. But I will no longer support bilateral aid. It has been tried and found wanting.” Representative Otto E. Pass man, chairman of the House Ap propriations subcommittee that perennially takes the biggest cut out of foreign aid appropria tions, once observed: “We are historically a nation of check grabbers. I do it myself. You go to a restaurant with a party and all the men reach for the check: We think it impresses people to pick up the bill. What we do as individuals we usually do as a nation.” New Approach A Presidential Task Force on International Development clearly had both of these leading Congressional critics of external aid in mind last week when it proposed “A New Approach (to) U.S. Foreign Assistance in the 1970's.” In response to Senator Ful bright and others who believe that the predominantly bilateral programs of the past have in volved the United States too deeply in the affairs of other nations, especially in Southeast Asia, the task force recom mended the channeling of sub stantially more aid funds through multilateral institutions such as the World Bank, the various regional banks and the United Nations Development Program. Specifically, the task force urged that the United States “take the lead” in bringing about an increase in the rich coun tries contributions to the World Bank from a total of $400‐mil lion a year at present to $1‐bil lion a year starting in 1972 and $1.5‐billion in 11175, in line with proposals of the World Bank's Pearson Commission. The United States share would remain at 40 per cent as at present. Although the study group, headed by Rudolph A. Peterson, retired president of the Bank of America, declared that “the downward trend in U.S. devel opment assistance appropriations should be reversed,” it bowed to economy‐minded Congress men like Mr. Passman when it flatly rejected the international aid target of I per cent of gross national product endorsed by the Pearson Commission and ac cepted by most other developed nations. Attempting to set a uniform deyelopment assistance “yard stick” for all industrial countries, the report argued, “puts the em phasis on the wrong side of the partnership.” The test, it said, “should be the determination of developing countries to mobilize their own resources and to adopt policies that will insure the ef fective use of funds.” In addi tion, the task force argued that the United States should not be expected to match its allies in the percentage of resources de voted to economic assistance be cause it is already bearing a far heavier share of the common defense burden. The United States currently allocates only 35 per cent of its gross national product to foreign economic aid, the lowest of any major donor country, and the percentage has been steadily dropping. During the Marshall Plan years of the late 1940's, United States assistance to its European allies reached a peak of 2.75 per cent of G.N.P. National Interest Like its many predecessors, the the Peterson panel agreed that the United States has a “pro found national interest” in pro moting economic development abroad. This has been the view of every President since Harry Truman. They have all resorted to such studies by groups of prominent citizens in order to rally public support for their aid programs and to give a new look to aid institutions that have fallen out of Congressional favor. This panel took special pains to caution against the excessive ex pectations for aid that have sometimes been raised in the past and that have contributed to the disillusionment with aid. “This country should not lodk for gratitude or votes, or any specific‐short‐term foreign policy gains from our participation in international development,” it declared. “Nor should it expect to influence others to adopt U.S. cultural values or institu tions. Neither can it assume that development will necessarily bring political stability. Devel opment implies change—political and social, as well as economic —and such change for a time, may be disruptive.” But over the long haul, the task force argued, American contributions to international de velopment will help build “self reliant and healthy societies in developing countries, an expand ing world economy from which all will benefit, and improved prospects for world peace.” The task force report, with its emphasis on multilateral aid and its cautious approach to spending levels is well‐suited to President Nixon's goal of lower ing America's profile abroad while promoting partnership with other nations. Even the re maining bilateral programs, the report suggests, should be made to conform with plans and standards developed by interna tional groups and should be con ducted with a minimum of American personnel overseas. Dismantle A.I.D. The study group would also attempt to lower foreign aid's vulnerable profile at home by dismantling the existing Agency for International Development, long & lightning‐rod for Con gressional and other critical wrath. Functions of the agency would be divided among a new, semipublic United States De velopment Bank, a Development Institute, the recently authorized Overseas Private Investment Corporation and a coordinating United States Development Council based in the White House. Whether this structural jug gling will really satisfy A.I,D.'s critics remains to be seen. Under the Peterson plan the new De velopment Bank would automat ically receive repayments on out standing A.I.D. loans—currently running at about $200‐million year—thus reducing its depend ence on annual Congressional appropriations. Congress may not be happy about this diminution of its control over the program. Some members already are pro testing the new emphasis on in ternational institutions because these agencies are less subject to direct scrutiny. Farm Out Work The Development Institute would farm out most of its work to private organizations, drasti cally reducing the existing A.I.D. bureaucracy. These private con tractors — universities, research organizations, business firms, etc. —would create a new constitu ency for aid. But it does not nec essarily follow that they can avoid the mistakes that have helped sour Congress on the old, government‐operated programs. One former aid official who is otherwise enthusiastic about the report has expressed strong reser vations about the way the new scheme separates functions—de velopment loans and technical assistance, for example — that were formerly combined under A.I.D. for greater coordination and efficiency. “It's an abortion,” he said. “It's crazy.” Congressional Reaction Congressional reaction to the proposals so far has been di vided. Senator Fulbright says the report “seems to move in the right direction.” But Congress man Passman is not reassured. “I am disappointed, shocked and distressed that any group of businessmen in America would issue such a report,” he com mented, noting the recommenda tion for a reversal in the down ward trend in appropriations. “I can only hope that the Presi dent will not accept the task force's findings.” As for President Nixon, he said he found the Peterson Re port “fresh and exciting.” After consultation with the National Security Council, he will submit his own conclusions on foreign assistance to Congress before the end of this month. —JAMES P. BROWN Rogers Wins the Policy Battle on Rhodesia In his State of the World Mes sage last month, President Nixon restated a ritualistic American stand against white minority rule in the southern sixth of Africa. He said: “Clearly there is no question of the United States condoning, or acquiescing in, the racial policies of the white‐ruled regimes. For moral as well as historical reasons, the United States stands firmly for the prin ciples of racial equality and self determination.” Last week, the Administration matched words with action. Sec retary of State William P. Rogers announced that the United States would cut its last link with the white minority regime in Rho desia by closing its consulate general in Salisbury. The de cision caused some surprise in Africa and elsewhere. It had been widely forecast that Washington would maintain the consulate even after the dec laration of a Rhodesian Republic March 2 — while insisting that this did not constitute recogni tion of Premier Ian Smith's Gov ernment. At one point, the White House announced such a policy, then reversed itself to say no de cision had yet been made. After all, the consulate had re mained in business when Britain severed remaining ties with its former colony after Rhodesia's adoption last June of a republi can Constitution that extended racial segregation and entrenched white supremacy. Responsible State Department officials favored closure and Consul Paul O'Neill in Salisbury had long urged termination of his assignment. But a Republican President was expected to be in fluenced more heavily by consid erations of economics, intelli gence sourcces and home‐front politics. One set of arguments went like this: The Smith regime is a fact of life and will be there a long time whatever we do; it is less oppressive than some other gov ernments, including Communist regimes, which we recognize; the consulate's political and eco nomic reporting has value for American policy‐makers. On the economic side, critics pointed out that the sanctions for which the United States voted in the United Nations had not only failed to topple Mr. Smith but had also hit Rhodesian blacks heavily and hurt neighboring Zambia more than Rhodesia. Sanctions had forced American users to buy chrome at higher prices from the Soviet Union while boy cotting two American‐owned companies in Rhodesia. ‘Southern Strategy’ Finally, to maintain the con sulate would please some Sena tors, Congressmen and other Americans loud in praise of Mr. Smith's effort to help perpetuate white supremacy in southern Af rica; thus it might advance Mr. Nixon's “Southern strategy.” Mr. Smith and colleagues hoped and perhaps believed that these arguments would carry the day in Washington. So did their white allies who rule South Af rica and the Portuguese terri tories of Mozambique and An gola. So did some British Tories. All of these, as it turned out, had overlooked or underrated the key man—the low‐key Secre tary of State. Mr. Rogers took his time on the Rhodesian ques tion but went out in February for a 15‐day tour of 10 African countries. He was favorably impressed by some leaders of the new Africa and struck by the depth of their feelings about the remaining bastions of white minorrity rule. In the Congo he spoke eloquently of it and pledged enduring Amer ican support for “this unfinished business” of African self‐de termination. Keeping a consulate in Salis bury was incompatible with such a stance. It damaged his credi bility and that of the President. It raised doubts about the con stancy of American support for United Nations sanctions and the unanimous Security Council de cision that the domination of 4.5 million blacks by 240,000 whites constituted a threat to interna tional peace and security. These were considerations that prevailed. The consulate decision is humiliating for Mr. Smith and, because it was followed by six other governments, leaves him close to diplomatic isolation. But Mr. Rogers knows it will not weaken the white regime ap preciably, and both he and Mr. Nixon have made it clear that they will not support liberation armies in southern Africa.. Mr. Rogers, then, has not cre ated a new, more aggressive Af rican policy; he has simply recommitted to a traditional American stance an Administra tion that had seemed to be headed in another direction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Opposition Growing in Wisconsin to U.S. Court Legalization of Early Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/15/archives/opposition-growing-in-wisconsin-to-us-court-legalization-of-early.html,"MILWAUKEE, March 14— With powerful Roman Catholic voices being heard, opposition is rising in Wisconsin against a recent Federal Court decision that permits abortion in the early stages of pregnancy.  The decision, made March 6 by a three‐judge Federal panel sitting in Milwaukee, declared that a portion of the State's law forbidding abortion was un constitutional. It allows a woman to have an abortion of an “unquickened” child, defined in the decision as a foetus be fare the first recognizable, stages of movement. The court's ruling, which look effect immediately, thus accomplished what advocates of a liberalized abortion law had been blocked from doing in the last two sessions of the Legislature. The main opposition had come from Catholics, who ac count for 38 per cent of the state's population and who have also prevented liberalization of the Wisconsin birth control law. In January, parish priests all over the state denounced liber alized abortion bills in an un usual “right to life” campaign. Archbishop Dismayed “Our reaction [to the deci sion] must be one of disappoint ment and dismay,” said the, Most Rev. William E. Cousins, Archbishop of Milwaukee, where Catholics outnumber Protestants two‐to‐one. The Archbishop said the decision was “clearly against a generally acknowledged principle that a foetus has a right to life.” The Wisconsin Citizens Con cerned for the Unborn, a group that has strong Catholic sup port, also denounced the deci sion as “a disaster” and de manded an appeal. It noted that local, state and national medical organizations had op posed abortions “on demand” as permitted by the decision. Conservative legislators also attacked the ruling. State Rep resentative Kenneth Merkel, a leading member of the John Birch Society, declared that the decision was “typical of the sickness that is contagious in our Federal courts” and called for an end to the lifetime ap pointment of Federal judges. The decision, by Federal Judges John W. Reynolds and Myron Gordon of Milwaukee and Otto Kerner of. Chicago, is to be appealed to the United States Supreme Court. It re sulted from the arrest of Dr. Sidney Babbitz of Milwaukee, who performed an abortion on a 23‐year‐old woman in his office last September. The de cision freed Dr. Babbitz. The Milwaukee County Dis trict Attorney, E. Michael Mc Cann, who prosecuted the case, said the decision had been based on a women's right to do what she wanted with her body before the foetus quickened. This usually occurs 16 to 18 weeks after conception. Mr. McCann said the Su preme Court would be asked in the case to rule on the allega tion that the Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitu tion guarantees a right to pri vacy. The amendment says, “The enumeration in the Con stitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.” The appeals court, in its rul ing, said: “The state does not have a compelling interest even in the normal situation [normal baby] to require a woman to remain pregnant during the, early months following her conception.” In the meantime, Wisconsin is apparently adapting to the change slowly. The Medical So ciety of Milwaukee County said it was still opposed to abortions except when pregnancy threat ened‐ the life of the mother or for other reasons written into the old law. Many nondenomin ational hospitals said they would have to have directors' meetings before allowing abor tions. The Wisconsin Conference of Catholic Hospitals said it would adhere to the church's traditional opposition to abortion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Exploring The Sexual Wilderness,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/15/archives/exploring-the-sexual-wilderness-exploring.html,"In the last few years, many writers from various religious traditions have been trying to help people find their way through what Vance Packard, in his book with the same title, called “the sexual wilderness.” Several re cent books are continuing this ex ploration, with very different points of view and different purposes.  An intentionally controversial one is Christopher Derrick's Honest Love and Human Life, subtitled, “Is the Pope Right About Contraception?” (Coward‐McCann, $4.95), an almost virulent attack on any methods of contraception except “periodic absti nence,” and on the ideas, opinions and writings of all those, Catholics in particular, who think otherwise. Ve hement and scathing in his indict ments of “the contraceptive mentali ty,” he forces the pro‐contraceptive reader, however wearily, to think out his own position all over again. “Sex is about babies. Whatever fur ther character or potential it may have—and there is no limit to the power and glory of this—it needs to be soundly and realistically founded upon that carnal, sweaty and blood stained fact. So established, it can be come a path to the human and heav enly ultimates; otherwise it can only lead to self‐deception, cruelty and nightmare.” Wow! However, Derrick doesn't really ar gue his case; he simply states that anyone who hasn't been perverted must see that contraception is wrong. “Into what state has the erotic sensi bility of our civilization declined, when so many good men and women can attempt to defend and justify so gross an obscenity, so blatantly dis honest a refusal of love?” His pas sionate conviction that, if our soci ety were not sick, everyone would agree with him and the Pope, re minded me how many of us who now think differently would have agreed with him not so many years ago. One wonders what kind of a God Derrick believes in. “The burden car ried by mothers, and by poor and overworked mothers in particular, is not to be treated lightly. One can reasonably suspect that the beauty and vitality of young women were designed by God in order to be sacri ficed on the altar of the next genera tion: God's mind does appear to work like that.” Or, “We would certainly appreciate this world more, and com plain about it less, if we saw it not as a hotel, given for our affluent en joyment, but rather as something more like a penitentiary—one to which we are rightly committed.” Yet Derrick's book has the great value of reminding us that contracep tion isn't the complete answer to problems of premarital sex or over population, and, still more, that man's much‐talked‐of conquest of nature is a very ambiguous and precarious af fair. The present overdue public con cern about pollution and ecology should make us listen attentively to Derrick's message: “In our present emergency‐situation, something in the nature of a general ‘cosmic piety’ is necessary for survival.” I think that he is fighting the wrong battle in the war against Western civiliza tion's cosmic impiety. But it's still a war that must be fought, and his book is useful in reminding us of both its complexity and necessity. I found Joseph Blenkinsopp's Sexu ality and the Christian Tradition (Pflaum, paper $2.95) one of the most valuable of these recent books in helping the reader sort out his ideas as to what the Christian tradition really is. Its purpose is “to attempt theological evaluation of the erotic in the context of the Judeo‐Christian tradition and the biblical tradi tion in particular.” But it is not a “scholarly” work in the sense of being abstract or difficult to read. On the contrary, it pro vides a fascinating exploration of its subject, under the guid ance of a Scripture scholar who has his erudition well in hand and puts it unostentatiously at the readers' service. The six chapter headings indicate his focal concerns: “Eros and the Christian,” “The Single God,” “Law or Love?,” “Freedom,” “The Silence of the Gospels,” “Celebration.” Eugene B. Borowitz's Choos ing a Sex Ethic (Schocken, $5) is for the Christian reader, a most interesting complement I to Blenkinsopp's book. Chris tian thinking seems to be work ing its way very painfully toward something much more like the Jewish mentality than that, say, of the early Church Fathers. But the book is ad dressed primarily to the unmar ried—and their parents and ad visors—to help them con sciously choose a sex ethic, in the light of modern person alist considerations—particu larly those of Buber—and “the Jewish experience.” I do not think that the au thor's presentation of possible standards of sexual behavior (healthy orgasm, mutual con sent, love, and marriage) is as enlightening as Rustum and Della Roy's Honest Sex (NAL World, cloth $5, paper 95 cents), first published in 1968. Their analysis of the possible meanings of “love,” in particu lar, seem to me much more helpful—Borowitz leaves the specific meaning he is attach ing to it rather hazy. But I would certainly give both this book and the Roys' to young people to help them in that most necessary task today, thoughtfully choosing a sex ethic. The essential basis for a sex ethic is, of course, an informed awareness of the dynamics of human relationships. Here Marc Oraison's Being Together: Our Relationships with Other People (Doubleday, $4.95) could be very helpful. Many or its insights into the kinds, ori gins, development and prob lems of human relationships should certainly be incorpo rated into “personal develop ment” and sex‐education pro grams. I would recommend it also to people who are suffer ing from the overemphasis on “opening oneself to others” current in some forms of sen sitivity training, encounter groups and the like. The book is particularly good on the “distance” that must exist between persons for any real relationship to be possible. It also raises the important problem in modern society of the “distortion in the normal network of human relation ships” resulting from the mod ern worker's having no per sonal relationship to those for whom he works—either to his employer or to the customer. Again, the final chapter, “Our Relationship to the ‘Other’ Who Is God,” could help people who have lost their childhood faith to recognize the possibilities of mature one. However, as in his earlier book, “The Human Mystery of Sexuality,” Oraison's develops his insights in a framework of orthodox Freudianism which the reader doesn't need to take as literally as the author does. It is particularly strange to see how this bias causes him to stress the gloomy, rather than the hopeful aspect of some of the paradoxes of human life. “Each person's life in this world begins on this note of ir reparable loss [the cutting of the umbilical cord].... It is rather as though the infant through an initial ‘misunder standing’ were forced to leave behind with that first ‘someone else’ in his life, his mother, an unfathomable part of his own living flesh.” Or again, having quoted Jesus' “No greater love than this can a man have, that he lay down his life for his friend,” he adds: “Or, paradoxi cally, one might follow Lacan, and paraphrase this by saying: “In the end, everything one gives is no more than excre ment.’” It would surely be more in line with both Judaic and essential Christian tradition to say rather that the “death” which the infant undergoes to its life in the womb is the pre requisite to its independent, more human life, and thus a kind of sign of the Resurrec tion, and that even excrement, at the toilet‐training stage of childhood, can take on the na ture of an accomplishment and a gift. This is certainly a book to be read, but it needs to be read with rose‐colored glasses to make its coloration normal. A much more superficial book on human relationships— the marriage relationship in particular—is Joseph and Lois Bird's Marriage Is for Grown ups: A Mature Approach to Problems in Marriage (Double day, $5.95). Many couples might find it helpful for some of its concrete suggestions about analyzing their motiva tions and behavior so as to im prove their marriage. But many of its suggestions are not con crete enough, and its underly ing philosophy of love is so fuzzy as to be positively mis leading. Couples are to work toward increasing “oneness” in a sense which implies a roman tic ideal rather than a real istic one. (Here Oraison's book would be useful as a correc tive.) Human relations and sexual ethics must, sooner or later, be considered in the wider con text of man's control over hu man life and the quality of hu man life. Who Shall Live? Man's Control over Birth and Death is a report prepared for the American Friends Service Com mittee (Hill & Wang, cloth $3.95, paper $1.75). It offers the reader an abundance of infor mation and thoughtful evalua tions to help him reflect realistically on the population problem, abortion and abortion laws, man's control over death, and the ethical and religious questions raised in all these areas. The final chapters, “Some Answers for Today” and “Choosing Priorities,” are fol lowed by four appendices giv ing population data, the effect on population growth of birth, death and fertility rates, and excellent summaries of meth ods of fertility control, and po sitions on abortion. The book brings out clearly that the question “Who Shall Live?” cannot be raised in con nection with either birth or death alone. It must include both, and also problems of med ical treatment—who shall have what kind?—and of the quality of human life while we have it. The chapter on the quality of life, which is finally the basic issue underlying all these other questions, could well be much further developed in another Report. The Friends' combina tion of compassion and common sense could do much to shed light on how we can work toward cultures in which “man can make responsible use of his powers — physical, intellec tual, creative, social, spiritual” —without destroying his en vironment and dehumanizing himself. These recent books taken to gether show that the “sexual wilderness” is only one aspect of the wilderness of today's problems. It cannot effectively be reclaimed for human living by itself, and the sooner all those who are concerned about sexual ethics and behavior real ize this fact the better for our society.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ruse vs. Reality in Albany,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/16/archives/ruse-vs-reality-in-albany.html,"The State Senate, which has never had a chance to vote on reform or repeal of New York's archaic abor tion law, will finally get that opportunity Tuesday. But there is widespread suspicion in Albany that the test has been set up for the primary purpose of defusing public pressure and killing any real hope for action this year. The bill that has been reported out of the Senate Codes Committee with a green light from the Repub lican majority leader, Earl W. Brydges, would make the decision on abortion a private question between patient and her physician. Passage of the measure would put this state alongside Hawaii in establishing what amounts to an unrestricted right to abortion by licensed doctors, a position well beyond the much more limlted reform bill that came close to passage in the Assembly last year. Even though sentiment for outright repeal of the present abortion law is clearly far more extensive than it Was a year ago, few Albany observers believe that is what has prompted Senator Brydges to let the Codes Committee bill come to the floor. A spokesman says that the majority leader will probably vote against the rneasure himself—and a no vote by Mr. Brydges could doom the bill. If it does die in the Senate, the G.O.P. leadership in the Assembly intends to take that as a definitive in dication of the hopelessness of action on any abortion proposal at this session. Thus, all the high hopes for forward movement with which the Albany year began will collapse. There seems little doubt that a majority for a com prehensive reform bill could be mustered in the As sembly. It will be inexcusable if the pushing of an ultra‐liberal measure in the Senate proves merely a cynical maneuver to delay once again the relaxation of a law that condemns thousands of women to needless anguish, pain and even death.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Letters to the Editor of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/16/archives/letters-to-the-editor-of-the-times.html,"Attitudes on Abortion To the Editor: The Times March 3 editorial “Legalizing Abortion” blames the indifference of “the Legis latures of New York and other states” for “the pressure for so drastic a proposal as elimina tion of all restrictions on abor tion.” According to the edito rial, these Legislatures have to tally ignored “the tragedy and needless suffering caused to both mothers and children by the rigidities of existing law.” I would suggest that the Legislatures in question should be commended for their concern to preserve and uphold the genuine liberal tradition of respect for and pro tection of human life even at its roots, where it is totally de fenseless and wholly subject to attack by those who have de ceived themselves into believing that human existence begins with the baby's first cry. Could it be that past editori als in The Times have contrib uted substantially to the “revo lutionary change in public atti tudes toward abortion” so that large numbers of people are now clamoring thoughtlessly for the end of all restrictions? The Times perhaps should have realized that once a pragmatic approach is adopted toward the destruction of human life, it be comes almost impossible to “draw the line.” (Msgr.) WILLIAM L. DOTY White Plains, N. Y. March 3, 1970 • Abortion Repeal To the Editor: The Feb. 25 Times news article on the rise of unwanted preg nancies as a result of fear of the birth control pill following Senator Gaylord Nelson's hear ings, and the Gallup Poll show ing that 46 per cent of Ameri can women now consider the pill a hazard, pinpoints a crucial danger of publicity‐hungry in vestigations in sensitive medi cal areas. If women are scared off the pill, the only virtually error‐free method of contraception, do not legislators have the responsi bility of warning of the higher error‐rate of other methods of contraception? If women leaving the pill suffer an increasing rate of un wanted pregnancies and con sequentially turn to abortion, often underworld abortion at great risk to their health and life, do not legislators also have the responsibility to repeal abor tion laws in every state so that physicians can terminate pregnancies resulting from contra ceptive failure? These questions are especially pressing now when the New York State Senate is debating the Dominick ‐ Patterson bill which would repeal our anti quated abortion laws and guar antee free choice on abortion between women and their doc tors. LAWRENCE LADER Chairman, Executive Committee National Association for Repeal of Abortion Laws New York, March 11, 1970 • Carswell Backed To the Editor: Judge Carswell should be placed on the Supreme Court because he represents the dom inant political philosophy of a major section of the country— the South. The Supreme Court has tra ditionally been constituted to represent each significant re ligious, racial, regional or po litical grouping. For example, the blacks are represented by Justice Marshall, the Jews have usually had a member since the appointment of Justice Brandeis, the Catholics have Justice Brennan, etc. This tends to create a healthy political and social climate, as no major group feels completely alienated from its decisions, even when they are adverse to its view point. They have a voice—this is a minimum requirement. For many years, however, the South has not had a mem ber which represented its ma jority point of view. This has been especially harmful since many of the decisions have been most pertinent to the South. This lack of representa tion on the Court has added to the South's feelings of frustra tion and isolation. It is a ridicu lous position for the North to prohibit a Southern Justice un less he shares the Northern liberal view on questions re garding civil rights. Critics of the Carswell appointment charge that he is not qualified to serve on the highest Court and his place ment there would only lead to a further lessening of respect for the Court from its already diminished level. What these critics overlook is that the Court's loss of respect is not due to the qualifications and integrity of its members, but that its majority view no longer represents the dominant po litical and constitutional out look current now in America. These critics also forget that three of the four appointees of the Kennedy‐Johnson Adminis trations had never served a day on any court prior to their service on the highest Court in the couhtry. The opposition to Judge Carswell is also fond of point ing to the percentage of his decisions that have been over turned by higher courts. These decisions, however, were over turned not because of any lack of competence on the part of Judge Carswell but because of a difference in philosophical in terpretation of the Constitution. On the basis of the above, Judge Carswell should be con firmed to the Supreme Court of the United States. MELVYN JAMES SUPLEE Bellmawr, N. J., March 6, 1970 • Place Names To the Editor: Periodic eruptions of public zeal for changing well‐estab lished place names are often well‐intentioned and always ill advised. Fortunately, the new names rarely stick. Who uses “The Avenue of the Americas” or “Franklin Delano Roosevelt Drive”? And do these mouth fuls really increase esteem for our late President or the other American republics? Place names are part of a shared past and, as pointed out in a recent letter, they deserve respect. Like landmarks, they lend a sense of continuity to the shifting scene. And there are pitfalls in im pulsive changes. In 1921 the 235‐year‐old name of Black well's Island was changed to Welfare Island in an effort to sweeten the odor of a prison scandal. Now that the place is to be rebuilt with fine new parks and handsome housing, who will want to say he lives “on welfare”?. HARMON H. GOLDSTONE Chairman, Landmarks Preservation Commission New York, March 5, 1970 • Usurious Bank Rates To the Editor: Your correspondent observed in your March 6 news story that the Bank of England had never had its bank rate at 8 per cent for so long a period since records started in 1797. He might have said simply “had never had 8 per cent for so long.” Before 1833 the Bank of England was not permitted by law to charge more than 5 per cent. The British had things called “Usury Laws.” Do we not need same present day usury laws? It must surely be a symptom of something wrong that we have to go back through centuries, including periods of expectation of price inflation, to the Middle Ages, to find interest rates generally so high as they are at present in advanced countries. For instance, the member countries of the “Group of Ten” might join a mutual covenant binding each member not to raise its central bank's official discount rate above 5 per cent.

Youths Are on Call to Help Their Own,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/16/archives/youths-are-on-call-to-help-their-own-groups-organized-by-youths-to.html,"PHILADELPHIA, March 15— “HELP has arrived,” say the ads with the telephone number in the underground newspapers, and troubled youngsters are re sponding by the thousands. In a brownstone near down town hippie neighborhoods, young street people without much more qualification than common experience and a con cern for “their own” answer calls 24 hours a day from youths plagued by drugs and other problems but too alienated to trust established agencies to help them. The organization, called HELP, was founded five months ago, by youth to help youth. It has been reaching some 1,000 people a week through incom ing telephone calls. Although similar groups have been at work on the West Coast for about three years, scores of new ones have sprung up in re cent months in such cities as Pittsburgh and Milwaukee and in campus towns across the country. Interest has extended to wealthy suburbs, too, with peo ple traveling from as far away as Scarsdale, N. Y., to see how HELP is run. These groups all have three things in common: shoestring budgets, altruistic motives and a policy of referring callers with serious problems to profes sionals. A first national meet ing, to exchange ideas and information, is being organized in Los Angeles for April 12–15. Many professionals believe that this effort by youth holds an important key to dealing with the national explosion in use of narcotics by young people. They concede that an older generation with different values in life has trouble communi cating in ways that the young counterculture considers rele vant. Some experts feel that no programs to warn youngsters of the dangers of drug abuse, such as those announced last week by President Nixon, will reach young users if channeled solely through established in stitutions. Delivering medical care and legal aid is also a problem. “A real gap in our time ex ists between providers of medi cal care and people who need it,” Dr. Arnold S. Reiman, chairman of the department of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, said in an inter view last week. “There is a great need to be filled.” Groups founded by young people to meet this need over lap in purpose but often differ in results from long‐estab lished social agencies and from newer ones run by older people or such institutions as churches and hospitals and universities. The ‘Square’ Services Help Line Center in New York City, for example, gets 6,000 calls a month, but is at Dr. Norman Vincent Peale's Marble Collegiate Church and attracts largely church‐oriented callers. The “hip” community is inclined to look on such services as “square” and insti tutional. HELP and most other groups like it try to deal with any real problem that impels a caller to phone. There are run aways, girls seeking informa tion on pregnancy or abortion or birth control. There are po tential suicides, people with ve nereal disease, prisoners, sol diers absent without leave, boys pondering the draft, people in need of a job or a place to stay or food or clothing or bus fare. But at least half of the calls taken by the youngsters at HELP concern drugs. Three boys on a bad “trip” called to say they had turned on the gas in the house. A calm, young voice that under stood their plight and spoke, their language persuaded them to turn it off, open the win dows, go for a walk and call back in an hour. “Everything is cool now,” they reported in the second call. A man called to say that his 18‐year‐old sister‐in‐law was shooting heroin and that her parents had refused to ac knowledge it, though her boy friend planned to leave her be cause of it. HELP sent a social worker, saw her and the fami ly and the boyfriend as a group five times, forced the parents to acknowledge that she was a junkie, re‐established com munication despite the “in credibly neurotic” attitude of the father in the middle‐class Jewish family, and started the girl in a rehabilitation center. Names in HELP's bulging case files are confidential, but many who have been aided are not loath to say so publicly. While waiting at the HELP office one night last week, Patricia Mars lander told how the organiza tion had come to her rescue by arranging for a lawyer from the public defender's office. The young woman said she had been picked up by the po lice “while I was strung out on Speed” after watching a bur glary. She said the lawyer put a stop to threats by detectives to hold her and take away her 4‐year‐old daughter. Calls Vary With Drug Supply Calls to HELP vary with fluctuations in police activity, because youths have learned to dial its number not only for bad trips but also for the one call they are allowed from police station. The number of calls also fluctuates with the arrival of new shipments of drugs, jumping noticeably aft er the arrival of a load of bad heroin. Doctors, lawyers and other professionals affiliated with HELP hold weekly training ses sions for some 30 young vol unteers of both races who man the three lines in the office day and night. The unpaid assistance of a number of “hip” professionals was lined up in 15 weeks of hard work last fall by HELP's 22‐year‐old founder, Sherri Winter. Policy now is set by a board of directors, half street people and half profes sional. The staff welcomes advice from professionals they consid er sympathetic. Miss Winter's office directory lists 12 phy sicians, eight psychiatrists, nine medical students with cars for emergencies, seven socials workers, three nurses and 19 lawyers who can be called. Miss Winter, a tall brunette who dropped out of college after three years at Temple University and the University of California at Los Angeles as a psychology major, got the idea for HELP in London last fall when she and Shelly Kap lan encountered RELEASE, an organization set up to provide legal aid in drug cases. Mr. Kaplan, whose sandy hair is as long as that of his friends despite hls 31 years, has provided most of the funds for HELP so far by presenting rock concerts, first at the Elec tric Factory here, and now in other cities. A healthy slice of the proceeds goes to HELP. Ads Bring In Donations Free advertising in the un derground press and radio also bring in donations that help to pay the rent and the astro nomical phone bill. Recently a small Philadelphia foundation approached HELP with a grant offer. A proposal is being drawn. HELP takes no moral or po litical stands except against the use of hard drugs such as heroin. “It's not good for you,” Miss Winter says. “We won't get lawyers for pushers. We would love to go into the high schools and give lectures on drugs.” In Milwaukee, Underground Switchboard makes strenuous efforts to educate users as well as to help with their immedi ate problems. This telephone service, with 30 volunteers tak ing 60 calls a day at St. Mary's Hospital, was started last fall by a 22‐year‐old girl, a coed who has a policy of anonymity. “I got the idea after going to Woodstock and seeing 16‐ year‐old kids from Milwaukee taking ‘downers [tranquil izers],’” she said the other day. The first organization of the genre, Switchboard, was founded about three years ago in San Francisco. Since then it has received 150,000 calls. Re cently it branched out, putting people in touch with “joyful ex periences” as well as helping with emergencies. ‘Ecstasy Center’ Added It has added an “ecstasy cen ter,” offering information about safe ways to turn on,” in cluding religions, astrology, yoga and new directions in theater, dance and film. It has gained sufficient financial sup port to pay the staff. Mission Switchboard, one of several phone services in the Bay area modeled on the orig inal Switchboard, lets run aways make calls home, per mits use of its office as a mailing address, disseminates job training information and lo cates overnight shelter. Crash‐pad services do not al ways work. In Philadelphia, HELP arranged for overnight stays at homes and apartments of sympathizers, but had to stop it when some guests stole things, damaged property and held marijuana parties. Some organizations fail al together. In Washington, the Switchboard, in the cellar of the Church of the Pilgrims at Dupont Circle was closed last month after four hippies who used it were implicated in a murder and after the congre gation learned that youngsters were sleeping in the church. Some Called Communistic Other groups say their ef forts are misunderstood. In Mi ami, the Center for Dialogue which operates a switchboard in a Lutheran church annex, has received bomb threats and is regularly denounced by right‐wing groups as Commu nistic or worse. Similar phone services, some still small, are sprouting up in many places. They in clude the Hip Health Center in Denver; Outside‐In in Port land, Ore.; the Electric Um brella in Kansas City, Mo.; Freedom City in Pontiac, Mich.; Project Place in Boston, and the Open Ear at the University of Arizona. Many advertise in under ground papers and on FM ra dio stations that feature rock music. But word of mouth seems to be the best conduit in the counterculture. “Spread the word,” say the ads in Distant Drummer and The Free Press here, “let every one know that HELP has ar rived.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Michigan Teach‐In Offers Four Days of Soul‐Searching About the Environment,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/16/archives/michigan-teachin-offers-four-days-of-soulsearching-about-the.html,"ANN ARBOR, Mich., March 15 — A chorus of coeds chanted to a Congressional committee a grisly ditty about abortion. Tenth‐graders peddled books about the “population bomb.” Indus trial leaders paid four‐figure sums to undergo booing. And the auto workers' chieftain acknowledged that it might be a better world with fewer people making automobiles. It was not until nearly midnight last night that the final curtain went down on what by any reckoning had to be one of the most extra ordinary “happenings” ever to hit the great American heartland: Four solid days of soul‐searching, by thousands of people, young and old, about ecological exigencies confronting the human race. The event was the Uni versity of Michigan “teach in,” an educational marathon of hundreds of campus and community activities, from talkfests and movies to hikes and the Congressional hear ing, all focused on the “en vironmental crisis”. The threat that man, through pol lution and other indiscre tions, it coming close to making his world unlivable. Conceived last fall by a cadre of 300 students call ing themselves “Environ mental Action for Survival” and carried out with a bud get of $50,000, the program evoked the active support of state and university officials, community organizations, members of Congress, indus try, labor, and several repre sentatives of the Nixon Administration. Preview of April 22 The teach‐in was a pre view of what the nation will witness on April 22, when about a thousand college campuses, several thousand high schools, and the com munities surrounding them will focus attention on a similar array of problems for a single day. “It wasn't only the things that were said, but the cas ual way they were said and the people who were saying them,” one Ann Arbor ma tron exclaimed. Such ideas, almost heret ical by the yardstick of American tradition, as an end to population expansion, national adjustment to a “no growth” economy, and mass action lawsuits against environmental offenders were discussed as inevitable by a procession of luminaries ranging from Dr. Barry Com moner, the ecologist, to Eddie Albert, the actor. Michigan's natural re sources director, Dr. Ralph MacMullan, in appearance the portly, bespectacled epitomy of the Midwest Rotarian, em phatically advocated legalized abortion as essential to popu lation stabilization and con servation of the world's dwin dling resources. Representative Marvin L. Esch, a Republican from Ann Arbor, urged participants to unite to “pressure” him and his fellow Congressmen into enacting needed environmen tal legislation. Demands to Vote Stock And the university's presi dent, Dr. Robben Fleming, joined actively in support of a program that culminated in demands for student‐faculty participation in voting the university's 27,538 shares of General Motors stock. The loudest notes of dis sent to the mass contempla tion of a reordered world came, paradoxically, not from the right but from the left. Discussions were regularly punctuated with Marxian re pudiations of environmental reform as an evasion of need ed social and political “revo lution.” And Negro leaders repeatedly charged that pre occupation with pollution was a “white middle‐class cop out” from attention to the problems of blacks and the poor. This dissent, however, if not refuted, was systematical ly enveloped. From Senator Gaylord Nelson, Wisconsin Democrat, an opening‐round speaker, to Senator Edmund S. Muskie, Maine Democrat, who spoke near the observance's end, advocates of reform stressed that ecology covered not just pollution but the relationship of all living things and that an acceptable envi ronment included an end to “ghettos, Appalachia and war.” Although Ann Arbor has seen repeated disorders, in cluding assaults on a contro versial bank, the teach‐in brought a minimum of campus disruption. Students smeared tar and feathers on the steps of a building where the At lantic Richfield Corporation. Alaska Oil developers, were job‐recruiting., And there was a brief, orderly sit‐in at a dean's office to protest, suc cessfully, a student's suspen sion. But in general the univer sity's 38,000 students, most of them covered with badges —from “Give Earth a Chance” to “Stop at 2” (children)— spent the Wednesday‐Satur day period in glazed‐eye absorption with environmental problems. Even when such figures as Arthur Godfrey, the enter tainer; Walter Reuther, presi dent of the United Auto Workers, and Herbert D. Doan, president of the much criticized Dow Chemical Company, were heckled for views auditors considered re actionary, the outbursts were brief and modulated. Of the $50,000 teach‐in budget, $5,000 was provided by the university. The rest came from sales of conserva tion books and badges, ad mission charges, private con tributions and industry, with Dow Chemical reportedly a $5,000 donor. The teach‐in organizers had deliberately avoided involve ments with the Nixon Admin istration, to avoid suspicions of “co‐opting.” But Dr. C. C. Johnson, the Department of Health, Education and Wel fare's consumer protection chief, and Robert Calm of the new Presidential Council on Environmental Quality, were featured speakers. Exceeds Expectations The House Government Operations Subcommittee on Conservation and Natural Resources, headed by Repre sentative Henry Reuss, Wis consin Democrat, took testi mony from the students about their environmental research and received a report from Denis Hayes, national coordi nator of the April 22 teach‐in, that 900 college campuses and 3,000 high schools were already on record as ready ing “E‐Day” programs. Mrs. Nina Johnson, presi dent of the local chapter of the League of Women Voters, said the extension of the teach‐in to the community had far exceeded her expec tations. “There naturally are a lot of people here who equate change with destruction, and are scared stiff,” she said. “But when a movement like this draws the active support of groups like the public schools, the churches and the Boy Scouts, 15,000 partici pants in a community rally, and hundreds of people who turned out to hike along the Huron River to look at its ecological problems—I think it has to be considered a re markable success.” A sort of tacit amnesty prevailed in regard to the “generation gap.” Senator Muskie told a youthful ques tioner: “I won't buy all your ideas, and you won't buy all of mine. But I'll listen, and I hope you will. And in the process I hope we may come up with a couple of packages of mutual values.” Even the scholarly Mr. Reuss remained unruffled when testimony on legalized abortion was unexpectedly punctuated by eight girl stu dents jumping up and recit ing: “Round about the cauldron go/In the poison entrails throw/Rot with chlorox, bleed from pins/Jam the rusty hangers in/Swallow Lysol, fall down stairs/Die like our sisters in filthy lairs/ Countless women who've swallowed lye/All you men have made them die...” “How,” Mr. Reuss asked his fellow committee mem bers with a smile, “can you declare such charming fern inists out of order?”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ALBANY TO OPEN ABORTION DEBATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/17/archives/albany-to-open-abortion-debate-brydges-says-he-will-vote-against.html,"ALBANY, March 16 — The long‐awaited Senate debate on a bill to liberalize New York State's abortion law is sched uled for tomorrow with the bill's fate still In doubt.  Senator Majority Leader Earl W. Brydges, Niagara Falls Re publican and long‐time oppo nent of reform, repeated his op position this year and said today that he would “vote no” on the bill. Mr. Brydges, who supervised the drafting of this version of the reform bill, said, however, that he had made no effort to influence votes one way or another. The Senator said that he had taken the lead in developing this bill—which would make abortion a private matter to be decided by the woman and her physician—because he thought the bills pending in the Assem bly were objectionable. Until today, he maintained, he had made no decision on how he would vote. It was Mr. Brydges who scheduled the debate on the bill for St. Patrick's Day, the feast of a Roman Catholic. The Ro man Catholic Church has strongly opposed abortion re form measures. Unofficial surveys today showed the sentiment on the bill to be extremely close. These surveys, conducted by newsmen, indicate 28 members are in favor of or lean toward the bill while 25 oppose the measure. Four members are re ported undecided. Twenty‐nine votes are re quired for passage. Senator Basil A. Patterson, Democrat of Manhattan and sponsor of the bill, said he had “heard varying reports” and rated the outcome “a tossup.” The Senate action is the key factor in abortion reform measures this year. Assembly Speaker Perry B. Duryea said he would consider the Senate vote controlling on the matter. Should the bill be defeated, it is doubtful the Speaker will allow either of the two different reform bills pending in the Assembly to proceed to a vote.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Council of Churches Offers Plan To Cut Parochial School Cost,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/17/archives/council-of-churches-offers-plan-to-cut-parochial-school-costs.html,"The New York Council of Churches voted yesterday to reaffirm its opposition to state aid to parochial schools and its support of abortion reform. But for the first time, the council, which is trying to bring Roman Catholics into the organization, adopted a statement favorable to a “shared‐time” plan for easing the burden on church supported schools.  The plan would permit paro chial school students to attend public schools for secular courses, relieving the hard pressed church ‐ supported schools of the responsibility of providing a complete education. The council endorsed “thorough study and experimentation” with the shared‐time idea. The easing of the traditional stance on state aid was con sidered by council executives to be in deference to Roman Catholics who are attending the meetings as observers. The council hopes to bring Catholics into the organization as full voting members. The Catholic hierarchy has so far declined full participa tion. However, there are three Catholics who now have votes as representatives of com munity church clusters. There are 26 Catholic observers in the council. Aid Study Under Way A council panel with Roman Catholic participants is in the process of preparing a complete restatement of the organiza tion's position on state aid to parochial schools. The reassessment is being made in light of the new ecu menical character of the body, which until a year ago was the New York Protestant Council. It represetns 650 churches in the city. At yesterday's meeting, the Rev. M. L. Wilson was elected to a second term as president of the council. He told the gathering of 200 delegates and observers at Riverside Church, 120th Street and Riverside Drive that the council would “do its utmost to answer critics of the council by con structive program and action.” Mr. Wilson was referring to criticism expressed by liberal white and black clergy that the council had failed to take “risky” stands on controversial issues. Dr. James H. Sheldon, chair man of the council's depart ment of Christian social rela tions, also defended the organi zation's social involvements, pointing to its housing and urban renewal agency and to its support for community con trol of public schools. Dissent on the Floor “Some of the council's critics owe us an apology,” he said. “We have done more than might have been thought possi ble a few years ago.” There was some dissent from the floor on one of the council's newest plans for increasing participation in its decision making, particularly among the black churchgoers who make up nearly 70 per cent of the Protestant population in the city. An attempt was made last year to introduce a system of church community associations in which neighborhood church clusters would supplement representation by individual churches—some of which have nearly no members. The Rev. Earl B. Moore of the American Baptist Conven tion, charged that the plan was “not working at the grass roots” to the disadvantage of the black community. Mr. Wilson conceded that at tempts to organize the commu nity clusters had failed. He called for a new “vehicle foi reaching all of those who want to see the council speak for them.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
State Senate Votes to Test Arbitration on Smaller Auto Accident Claims,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/18/archives/state-senate-votes-to-test-arbitration-on-smaller-auto-accident.html,"ALBANY, March 17—The Sen ate passed and sent to the As sembly today a bill providing for a pilot program of manda tory arbitration on automobile accident claims involving $3,000 or less.  The bill, sponsored by Sen ator Bernard Gordon, a Peeks kill Republican who is chair man of the Senate Insurance Committee, would establish ar bitration panels consisting of three lawyers. Mr. Gordon said that such a system would “help tremendously” in clearing clogged court calendars. He estimated that the cost for the program, if the bill was approved by the assembly and signed by Governor Rockefeller, would be about $450,000 a year. The bill has an effective date of Sept. 1 and Mr. Gordon said that the program would cost the state about $200,000 from that time until the beginning of the fiscal year beginning April 1, 1971. In the brief debate on the bill, Mr. Gordon said the arbi tration system had been used in Philadelphia for 12 years with “excellent results.” Success in Philadelphia The bill was “not a substitute for ‘no fault’,” Mr. Gordon said, adding that “this bill has been very close to me for two years now.” The Senator was referring to a “no fault” automobile insur ance bill introduced by the Governor recently, a bill that Mr, Rockefeller said could re duce premiums by as much as 56 per cent. Proponents of the “no fault” approach — which would remove from automobile insurance coverage the question of who is at fault — contend that it would speed up court action and reduce legal costs. Mr. Gordon has said that the no‐fault bill will not get out of committee this year because “it's a complicated question that will require extensive pub lic hearings.” Mr. Rockefeller has also expressed doubt that the bill will get a legislative airing this year, partly because so many legislators are lawyers and many lawyers earn por tions of their incomes from con tingency fees in automobile ac cidents. During the debate today, Senator Jack E. Bronston, a Democrat of Queens who voted for the bill, said that “while not related to ‘no fault’ [it] would certainly take a lot of pressure for that legislation off.” The vote on the bill was 54 to 3. The Assembly met briefly and acted on minor bills. In the Senate, where many legis lators wore green St. Patrick's Day carnations, the long awaited debate on a bill to liberalize the state's abortion law was postponed until to morrow. Senate Majority Leader Earl W. Brydges, Republican of Niagara Falls, who had sched uled the debate for today, told the Senators that he was “dis turbed” by an item in today's, editions of The New York Times that mentioned that he had scheduled the debate on the feast day of a Roman Catholic and that the Roman Catholic Church has strongly opposed abortion reform measures. “Let me say to The New York Times,” Mr. Brydges said, “that I cannot pick a day in the year which is not a saint's day or a feast day in my church. ... I was disturbed lest St. Patrick be blamed if this bill went down to defeat today and so I elected to put it over until tomorrow, but tomorrow ... happens to be feast day of St. Cyril of Jeru salem.” “I think I have a right to resent this kind of a reference to my religion,” Mr. Brydges said, reaffirming his personal opposition to reform of the abortion law, which permits termination of a pregnancy only when the life of the mother is endangered. Editorial Is Criticized Mr. Brydges also criticized a Times editorial that he said stated that “I had deliberately put to the floor of the Senate ... a tough abortion bill in the hope that it would fail because of its very toughness.” “I have done nothing to in hibit its movement from com mittee or to inhibit its pas sage,” he said. After his speech, about a dozen women favoring “abor tion on demand” began to shout in the spectators' gallery. “Your silence condemns thou sands of women to death,” one woman shouted. Lieut. Gov. Malcolm Wilson had the sergeant‐at‐arms re move the women, and then ad monished a television camera crew from WTEN, a local sta tion, not to use footage of the gallery demonstration. Other developments included the following: CRIMINAL JUSTICE DEPARTMENT Mr. Brydges and Assembly Speaker Perry B. Duryea, ?? publican of Montauk, annouced that they would sponsor a pro posed constitutional amend ment establishing a state De partment of Criminal Justice. THRUWAY SPEED LIMIT The Senate, without debate, passed and sent to the Assem bly a bill that would raise the speed limit on the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway from 65 to 70 miles an hour. STUDY OF SPENDING Twenty‐seven Assemblymen and six Senators joined with the Conservative party's exec utive director, James D. Griffin, in urging the newly formed Legislative Commission on Ex penditure Review to include “a study of school spending among its first projects.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ABORTION REFORM APPROVED, 31‐26, BY STATE SENATE",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/19/archives/abortion-reform-approved-3126-by-state-senate-bill-removes-all.html,"ALBANY, March 18—The State Senate, after five straight hours of emotional debate, to day voted 31‐to‐26 to replace the state's 19th‐century abor tion law with one of the most liberal measures in the country.  The bill, which would allow a pregnant woman and her doc tor to decide the question of abortion, now goes to the As sembly, where it is expected to be debated next week. The measure contained no time limits on when abortions could be performed, no resi dency requirements or restric tions on how many times a woman could obtain an abor tion—all points that had been raised by opponents of the bill. Assembly supporters, many of whom crowded into the Sen ate chamber jammed with spec tators for the debate, which was described as “one of the most historic” of the Senate's history, are optimistic of its chances in that chamber. Reformers in the Assembly have carried the battle unsuc cessfully for the last five years and believe passage by the Senate—which is normally the more conservative house — is the key to final success. Signature Likely Governor Rockefeller has re peatedly called for reform and is considered likely to sign the bill should it reach his desk. [In Maryland, the House of Delegates approved a bill to repeal the state's laws reg ulating abortions. The meas ure now goes to the State Senate. Page 38. ] The present New York State law, one of the most restric tive in the country, permits abortions only to save the mother's life and reformers have argued that it favors the rich who can obtain psychiatric reports to support a legal abor tion, and forces the poor to re sort to “butchers who illegally Iply the trade” of abortions. Senate galleries were packed with spectators and a wall of staff members—mostly women circled the Senate floor, pressing against the backs of the rear row (If Senate seats through the long hours of de bate. The glaring lights of tele vision—permitted to record the debate under a waiver of Sen ate rules barring photographers —filtered through clouds of smoke, but the stuffy chamber was orderly through the lone hours of oratory. Only once when the first “no” vote was recorded to a round of hissing —was a request for order re quired. From the first, the debate was directed at a personal level, as 57 men attempted to change a law that many wom en contend is of primary con cern only to women. Senator D. Clinton Dominick, a Newburgh Republican and chief sponsor of the reform bill, led the way by pointing out that in his attempt to un derstand women he would have to relate to “one woman — my wife.” Mr. Dominick, the father of “five wanted and loved chil dren,” said his wife had re cently discussed the matter with him and said that, at 48 years of age, she would seek an abortion if faced with another pregnancy. “And you know,” Mr. Dom inick said very quietly and mat ter‐of‐factly, “I would have helped her.” It was clear from the be ginning that Mr. Dominick, who is universally accepted in the Senate as one of its most re spected members, was estab lishing a favorable field of de bate for supporters of the bill with his quiet presentation. “There is nothing worse,” he concluded in his appeal to let women decide whether to bear a child, “than an unwilling mother and the unwanted child. It leads to divorce. It leads to broken homes. It leads to drop outs. It leads to battered chil dren—neglected children.” The Senate majority leader, Earl W. Brydges, Republican of Niagara Falls, a Iong‐time op ponent of abortion reform and one whose opposition could have kept this bill from ever coming to the floor for debate, picked up the personal thread as debate ended. Disturbed by Bill One of the most gifted and persuasive speakers in the chamber, Mr. Brydges did not enter into debate until the roll was being called. “I am terribly disturbed by this bill,” Mr. Brydges said in his clipped, gravel‐voiced man ner. “I have kept my word to do nothing to keep this bill from coming to the floor or not to lobby personally against it. But I have a deep, real, abid ing conviction that this is the wrong way for the state to go because we are a bell wether state and many other states will follow our lead.” From the beginning of the debate, members of the Ro man Catholic faith, like Mr. Brydges, took great pains to divorce their actions on the bill from the teachings of their religion. However, of the 22 Catholics in the Senate, 18 voted against the bill. The most liberal abortion law in the United States now is Hawaii's, which went into effect a week ago and made the deci sion strictly a matter between a woman and her doctor. How ever, it requires that the woman be a resident of Hawaii for at least 90 days. An abortion to protect a woman's physical or mental health is authorized in 12 states; if there is indication of fetal malformation in 9 states; in case of rape in 11 states, and in case of incest in 9 states. A bill similar to the New York bill passed the lower house in Arizona two weeks ago and has gone to the State Senate. Legislation like Hawaii's law is now before 13 other state legislatures. The courts have invalided the existing statutes in the District of Co lumbia and Wisconsin, but the decisions have been appealed, and doctors have not generally begun to perform abortions in these jurisdictions. The New York bill would repeal part of an 87‐year‐old Iaw which reads: “An abortion al act is justifiable when com mitted upon a female by a duly licensed physician acting under a reasonable belief that such is necessary to preserve the life of such female.” If the bill passed today by the Senate is approved by the Assembly and signed by the Governor, the New York law would be amended to read simply: “An abortional act is justifiable when committed up on a female by a licensed physi cian.” Other sections of the law would be amended to delete reference to the restriction al lowing abortions only when a woman's life is in danger. Many observers of today's de bate and vote—the first time the Senate has considered abor tion reform—saw the action as an indication that rising pub lic préssure for change is being felt here. “A year ago,” one Assem blyman remarked, “we couldn't even get the thing considered in committee in the Senate and this year it has passed.” Much of the pressure for re form has come from militant feminist groups, but a deep and consistent effort also has come from minority groups whose members most often become statistics in the grim catalogue of women killed by crude, il legal abortions. At 5 P.M. the 29th “yes” vote—the number needed for passage of a Senate bill—came from Senator Waldaba H. Stew art, a black Democrat from Brooklyn. “I rise to cast the deciding vote,” Mr. Stewart said, “to help move the. Empire State toward a new approach to new society. We are venturing into new waters, toward a so ciety in which we look hon estly at ourselves and our re lationships and our failures ... Mr. President, I vote yes.” “Until we are willing to relate to the question of life after birth, I don't want to hear of any immortality about death before birth,” he said earlier. “I cannot agree,” he con tinued, “with those whose morality allows them to sup port wholesale extermination in wars or who support a welfare system that bring slow death to those who are poor.” Opponents of the bill were equally impassioned in their moral pleas that their moral views could not accept the bill. Of these, Senator Edward S. Lentol, Brooklyn Democrat, was the first to speak of mur der in connection with the bill. “Are you here today going to sanctify the killing of a child?” Mr. Lentol asked. “I am not talking as a Catholic but as one with deep moral convictions and I say this is murder.” Senator John J. Marchi, Staten Island Republican; ac companied a long, yamblimg philosophical discussion of the issue with color slides o?? anatomical drawings showing the stages of the development of a fetus. He was trying to convince this colleagues that even a 12 week fetus had many characteristics he equated with human life. Senator William T. Conklin, Brooklyn Republican, the father of a Mongoloid child and long time opponent of reform, spoke of the joy these “special chil dren” bring to parents and of his deep‐seated opposition to those who argued that abortion was justified to avoid the birth of retarded children.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Maryland House Approves Repeal of Abortion Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/19/archives/maryland-house-approves-repeal-of-abortion-law.html,"ANNAPOLIS, Md., March 18 (AP)—The Maryland House of Delegates approved a bill to re peal the state's laws regulating abortions.  The vote was 74 to 59. The majority needed for passage was 72. The proposals which goes to the State Senate with only two weeks remaining in the 1970 session, would leave abortions controlled only by the Medical Practices Act, requiring that they be performed in a hospital by a licensed physician.

Vermont Senate Balks MONTPELIER, Vt., March 18 (AP)—After a long and often bitter debate, the Vermont Senate today killed a measure that would have overhauled the state's 124‐year‐old abortion statutes. Only yesterday, the Senate had given the measure prelimi nary approval on a vote of 15 to 14. The vote today was 20 to 10. The turnabout came despite warnings from backers of the measure that its rejection would leave Vermont “an abor tion‐on‐demand” state.

[Page 1, Columns 1–3.] Officials in Washington seemed surprised by the Prince's overthrow, which came after a week of demonstrations in Pnompenh against the Vietcong and North Vietnamese. The attitude in Washington appeared to be concern over possible extension of the Viet nam war into Cambodia coupled with belief that Prince Sihanouk might still emerge as a factor in Cambodian politics.

Assembly Passes Bill to Permit V.D. Treatment Without Guardian's Consent,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/19/archives/assembly-passes-bill-to-permit-vd-treatment-without-guardians.html,"ALBANY, March 18—Final legislative approval was voted today on a bill that would per mit physicians to treat persons under the age of 21 for vene real disease without obtaining the consent of parents or guar dians. The present law requires such consent.  The bill, which was approved by the Assembly and sent to Governor Rockefeller, was de signed to overcome the hesi tancy of both physicians and teen‐aged patients to act under the present restriction of paren tal consent. The Joint Legislative Com mittee on Health Problems had recommended the measure to deal with the growing prob lem of venereal disease among teen‐agers. In an earlier Senate debate, legislators said young people walk out of, physicians' offices, willing to suffer with the disease rather than face parental wrath. In other action, the Assem bly voted final approval to a bill that would clarify the New York City Police Commission er's authority to appoint special patrolmen to issue summoneses and perform custodial and pro tective services. The 50‐year‐ old practice, under which uniformed patrolmen serve with out firearms, had been success fully challenged in the courts. New York City officials said that unless the Commissioner's authority to appoint such pa trolmen was upheld, more than 5,000 policemen would have to be diverted from regular duties to handle custodial tasks in such areas as welfare offices. The sharpest debate of the Assembly's five‐hour session was over a proposal by As semblyman John G. McCarthy, Republican of Suffolk, to bar the use of the names of Viet nam War dead “as part of a protest demonstration against the Government of the United States.” Under the bill, it would be a misdemeanor to release such names when the next of kin felt “their names were being used in direct contradiction for which they made the supreme sacrifice.” A group of Democrats op posed the bill. One of them, Assemblyman Stephen J. Solarz of Brooklyn said, “it will avail us little to save a corrupt and crumbling military dictatorship in Saigon if we restrict freedom of speech here at home.” One of the bill's sponsors, Assemblyman Vincent Riccio, Republican of Brooklyn, replied: “You're always hung up about constitutionality. Let the courts decide this.” A vote on the bill was terrupted and further action postponed until next week when sponsors realized that not enough votes were present in the half‐empty house. A similar delay took place recently in the Senate's consideration of the bill. Phornography Measure The Assembly passed and sent to the Senate an amend ment to the Penal Law that would make it a Class‐A mis demeanor, punishable by a year in jail, for a person to give, sell or loan to a minor “in decent materials.” The original legislation provided the penalty only when the material was sold or lent for monetary con sideration. The sponsor, Assemblyman Clark C. Wemple, Republican of Schenectady, said the bill was aimed at “hard core por nographers.” But Assemblyman Oliver Koppell,. Democrat of the Bronx, argued that the bill's wording would make teen agers who “experiment” with such material liable foi prosecution. Throughout the session, legis lators drifted from the chamber to listen in on the abortion debate which was the center of attention down the hall in the Senate. There was a mixture of chatter and malaise at times, as many lawmakers prepared to head for home after a three‐ day legislative week. Assemblyman Vito P. Bat tista, Republican‐Conservative of Brooklyn, delivered a loud, arm‐waving defense of land lords at one point, asserting they had not been permitted adequate rent increases over the years. In contrast, the leg islators regularly raised their own salary, Mr. Battista as serted, drawing cheers when he added: “And I understand it's going to go higher.” The Assembly approved and sent to the Senate a measure that would require grocery stores and supermarkets to have available for their custo mers small computing devices to break down the cost of an item into the price per unit of weight or measure. The sponsor, Assemblyman Wem ple, said he had in mind small devices costing about $1.50, which might be attached to shopping carts. Two bills that would have permitted the awarding of larger public work and pur chase contracts without com petitive bidding were rejected by the Assembly. One bill, sponsored by Assemblyman Jo seph J. Kunzeman, Republican of Queens, would have per mitted the state Office of Gen eral Services to forgo bidding in amounts up to $2,500, rather than the present limit of $1,000. The second measure, which had been approved by the Sen ate, would permit local governments to forgo bidding up to $3,500 for public works, rather than the present $2,500. A bill sponsored by Assem blyman Salvatore J. Grieco, Democrat of Brooklyn, to en large the investment power of savings banks was withdrawn from the “floor after complaints from both sides of the aisle. Critics said savings banks were stinting on their obligation to make mortgage loan funds available to potential home owners, and the bill would compound this by permitting them to invest in corporations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At Last, Abortion Reform",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/20/archives/at-last-abortion-reform.html,"After years of delay in Albany, when an abortion reform measure could not even get out of committee for floor debate and a vote, the Senate has now approved the most sweeping reform yet enacted any state. Its prospects for approval in the Assembly are encouragingly good.  Abortion reform is long overdue. The state's present law, enacted in the 19th century, permits abortions only when a licensed physician has “a reasonable belief that such is necessary to preserve the life” of the prospective mother. It is a cruelly restrictive law that has doomed countless thousands of women to continued unwanted pregnancies, even those that might have resulted from incest or rape or those that might pose a threat to physical or emotional health. The reform approved by the State Senate repeals the language restricting abortions to cases in which the life of the prospective mother can be said to be endangered if the pregnancy is allowed to continue. It would permit abortions when a woman and her physician agree that one is desirable. This may seem like too sweeping a reform of too restrictive a statute. It is, however, probably the only kind of change that will ultimately withstand court challenges that have already been mounted in various states against existing abortion laws. While fully recognizing the depth and sincerity of feeling of those who believe that abortion is an immoral act, we have come to the conclusion that is not a matter for the state to decide but that each woman, in consultation with her physician, should have the right to determine whether to continue a pregnancy or not, just as she should have the right to decide whether to begin one or not. We therefore urge the Assembly and Governor Rockefeller to join the Sen ate in establishing this as the public policy of the state.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stiff Anticrime Bill Approved by House,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/20/archives/stiff-anticrime-bill-approved-by-house-stiff-crime-bill-voted-by.html,"WASHINGTON, March 19— The House passed a stiff anti crime bill for the District of Co lumbia tonight that includes preventive detention of suspects regarded as dangerous.  A coalition of Southern Dem ocrats and conservative Repub licans decisively defeated every attempt by liberals to modify the proposal. The final roll‐call vote was 294 to 47. The proposal has the strong backing of President Nixon. Ad ministration spokesmen have indicated that the law would he a pilot project for Washington with the enactment of a similar national proposal pos sible. The House‐passed measure now goes to a House‐Senate conference committee to work out wide differences with a bill already passed by the Senate. The House bill has been subject of controversy in Wash ington. The District government has opposed several of its pro visions, including the preven tive detention of criminal defendants regarded as danger ous to the community and the transfer of the District's prison facilities from city operation to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. The bill also contains pro visions that would permit policemen to enter a premises without knocking (the so‐called “no‐knock” search) in efforts to seize narcotics and gambling evidence that might be de stroyed; allow wiretapping in a list of offenses that includes murder, abortion, kidnapping and arson; prohibit resisting arrest, whether the arrest is Lawful or not, and provide mandatory life sentences for conviction of a third felony. Pasage was Predicted Even opponents of the more controversial parts of the bill predicted today that the House would pass it. Although lib erals fought for a modification of those portions, the Repub licans, led by Representative Gerald R. Ford of Michigan, the minority leader, and the South ern Democrats, led by Repre sentative John L. McMillan of South Carolina, the chairman of the House District Commit tee had the votes to defeat every liberal move. “This bill has constitutional problems, severe constitutional problems dealing with the First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Eighth Amendments,” re marked Representative Brock Adams, Democrat of Washing ton, one of the liberal leaders. But the bill's proponents re jected amendments that would have modified the mandatory life sentence, eliminated the no‐knock provision and substi tuted an “accelerated crime trial calendar” — or speedier trial—for cases involving vio lent crimes in place of pre ventive detention. Mr. Adams told the House that only one thing would stop crime: “Restore the judicial sys tem of the district, which this House has let fall into neglect.” Representative Emanuel Ccl ler, Democrat of Brooklyn, said that the preventive detention provision was as “full of holes as Swiss cheese.” Preventing Hysteria “We cannot with impunity erase these rights in our Con stitution,” Mr. Celler said. “We could prevent hysteria in the country, especially here in the District of Columbia, if we would not lose our calm.” The Senate version of the bill does not contain provisions for preventive detention and man datory sentencing. There is a no‐knock provision, but the Senate measure would put more of a burden on the police to show that a policeman's life would be in danger or that evi dence would be destroyed. Fewer Offenses The Senate bill also has a wiretapping provision, but it applies to fewer offenses and specifically prohibits illegal wiretapping. The House version of the crime proposal was an exten sion of what President Nixon proposed last year for the Dis trict.

CHANGES ARE ASKED IN ABORTION BILL,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/20/archives/changes-are-asked-in-abortion-bill.html,"ALBANY, March 19 — Earl W. Brydges, the State Senate majority leader, said today that he would consider further leg islation to modify the abortion reform bill that passed the Senate yesterday if the measure was enacted into law.  Mr. Brydges, Republican of Niagara Fals, cleared the way for yesterday's Senate debate although he is a long‐time op ponent of reform. He said to day that among the measures he might seek was a bill that would forbid abortions except in emergency cases beyond a certain period of pregnancy. The bill, which passed the Senate 31 to 26 yesterday, would make New York's the most liberal abortion law in the country. It simply requires agreement between a pregnant woman and a physician for an abortion to be performed. There are no residency or any other restricting requirements in the bill, which awaits action in the Assembly, where pros pects for its passage have been called good. The state's present law, on the books for a century, per mits abortions only to save the mother's life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Goldberg Says Only He Can Win for Democrats,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/21/archives/goldberg-says-only-he-can-win-for-democrats.html,"Arthur J. Goldberg holding his first news conference as a candidate yesterday, said he had finally decided to run for Governor because “I can lead the liberal and progressive forces to victory in November and no one else can.” The former Supreme Court Justice and representative to the United Nations, who said the day before that he would seek the Democratic nomina tion for Governor, stood for 50 minutes handling questions from reporters. His answers covered subjects from his service nine years ago as Secretary of Labor to his plans for the two weeks before the nominating meeting of the Democratic State Committee on April 1, including the follow ing: ¶“It's just nonsence to call me the candidate of the bosses. I did not consult with any old line leaders.” he said when asked about reform Demo crat charges that his candidacy is sponsored by big‐city county leaders. ¶“Those candidates are not making hay . . . recent polls I have seen confirm that,” he said when asked about the can didacies of Eugene H. Nicker son and Howard J. Samuels. ¶“I would welcome the sup port of the Liberal party. I be lieve I'm entitled to their sup port by my record.” ¶“I would not have run if there was any question about my residency,” he said, produc ing a letter from Bernard Bo tein, former appeals court jus tice giving his opinion that Mr. Goldberg satisfied the state's five‐year residency require ments for a governor. ¶“Yes, I would sign the abortion reform bill if I were Governor,” he said, but he was less specific in answering other questions about state issues, promising detailed statements later. The news conference in the Palm Room of the Americana Hotel started with young sup porters of Mr. Goldberg trying to cover the large gold plaster crowns on the red velvet wall behind their candidate. But television and newspaper photographers gleefully shot pictures of Mr. Goldberg with a crown floating just above his head. The tone of the news confer ence at times was indicated by the prefacing of questions with such phrases as “Are you try ing to tell us ...” Mr. Goldberg opening state ment—written after discussions Thursday night with a group of political advisers led by Stephen E. Smith, brother‐in law of Senator Edward M. Ken nedy—concentrated on his in decision about running and his relationship with Democratic county chairmen from New York City and Buffalo. Conditions of Candidacy “If a majority of the dele gates at the State Democratic Committee choose to designate me as a candidate for Gover nor, I will make the race,” he said. “This decision, as you well know, represented a change of mind on my part. I had previ ously, and in categorical terms, stated that I would not run. “Why this change? Nobody twisted my arm. Nobody has made any commitments to me. I have sought no commitments. And I have made commitments to no one—and I shall not.” In discussing his relatively late entry into the guberna torial race, Mr. Goldberg said: “The people know my views very well, better, I think, than the views of the other candi dates.” Televised Debate What about the challenge by Mr. Nickerson, Nassau County Executive, for an immediate, televised debate? “I support a debate if the state committee wants it.” In making that point, the former Associate Justice em phasized that he is a candidate only for the nomination of the 345 members of the committee which will meet on April 1. Until that meeting, he explained later, he plans no public cam paigning and will limit his po litical activities to meetings with committee members. The committee nominee — and many Democratic politi cians expect it to be Mr. Gold berg because of his city sup port — will be listed as the designated Democratic candi date on the June 23 primary ballot. Also listed will be other candidates who receive 25 per cent of the committee vote or collect the signatures of 10,000 enrolled Democrats with 50 signatures from at least 47 of the state's 62 counties. Other Candidates In addition to Mr. Nickerson and Mr. Samuels, former Under Secretary of Commerce, the other candidates are Queens District Attorney Thomas J. Mackell and William J. vanden Huevel. A sixth candidate, Jo seph Ettinger, withdrew yester day. In questioning about the Lib eral party nomination. Mr. Goldher7, was asked whether he would accept the Liberals de mand that their candidate would stay in the race as the Liberal candidate even if he lost the Democratic primary. “I'm going to win the Demo cratic primary,” he said.

"New Abortion Agency Here Arranges Travel, Housing and Care in Clinics in London",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/22/archives/new-abortion-agency-here-arranges-travel-housing-and-care-in.html,"An agency specializing in four‐day trips to London for women to obtain legal abor tions was opened last week by three persons who plan to use the profits to set up abortion clinics in the United States once the laws here are liberal ized.  The backers of the concern, the British Referral Service and Travel Agency, Inc., are Roy Lucas, a 28‐year‐old lawyer whose suit charging that the New York State abortion law is unconstitutional, is scheduled to be heard in Federal Court here next month, John A. Set tle Jr. and Ellen L. Glas cock, both 25‐year‐old editorial employes of a Manhattan pub lishing company. For $1,175, the agency will arrange for a woman to fly to London, where she will be met at the airport by a limousine, accommodated at a hotel with meals provided and treated at one of a group of private clinics where surgeons have been performing abortions since England's abortion law was liberalized in 1967. The law there now permits women to get legal abortions virtually on request, with the approval of two doctors. The price for the trip to London includes the $420 round‐trip plane ticket, which the woman buys directly from an airline, the $575 fee, which she pays directly to the London clinic; $25 for passport and vac cination; and $155 to the agency. The agency's fee includes the limousine, hotel and meals for up to four days, which Mr. Settle estimates will cost $70. The remainder, Mr. Settle said, will be used to offset the agency's overhead — $500 a month in rent at its renovated brownstone at 160 West 86th Strect, $100 for five telephone lines, a 24‐hour answering serv ice and a staff of up to seven persons that will eventually be able to handle 300 cases a week. Half of any profits, he added, will go toward setting up free abortion clinics for the poor in states soon expected to liberal ize their laws, a quarter will help set up abortion clinics for middle‐income women and a quarter will be used for loans, at 1 or 2 per cent interest, to women who cannot afford they $1,175 for the London trip. Women will remain overnight at the London clinic. The oper ation takes 25 minutes. “We're not blazing any trails,” Mr. Settle said yester day. He was sitting with his wife, his 3‐month‐old daughter and Miss Glascock in the agency's sparsely furnished sec ond‐story office. “We're just making it easy for people who have money to get abortions,” he added. “The whole thing is a jungle and has always been used by exploiters and profiteers. We're just try ing to get people through tha jungle to a nicer locale where they can see what they're doing and make their decisions with out any legal doubts, and with all the practical details taken care of for them.” If New York's abortion law, is liberalized by the Legislature (the State Senate passed such a measure last week) or struck down by the courts, Mr. Settle said, the agency will become primarily a counseling service to direct women to where they can obtain legal abortions here. British women who go to private clinics pay $400, com pared to the $575 charged American women. Abortions also are performed free under England's national health pro gram, but there is often a long waiting list for such operations. Earlier this year, legal au thorities in Massachusetts studied a similar offer by the London Agency of Springfield, Mass., offering to make ar rangements for abortions in Britain at $1,250. The price in cluded air fare, passports, health certificates and hotel accommodations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RUBELLA VACCINE SPED TO MILLIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/22/archives/rubella-vaccine-sped-to-millions-us-officials-hope-to-avert-new.html,"WASHINGTON, March 21— Government health officials ex pect that 12 million American children will have been vac cinated against rubella by the end of June.  So far, 4,787,695 have re ceived protective shots against the virus disease in Federal, state and local programs that began after the first vaccines were licensed last year. The objective is to forestall an other nationwide epidemic. As a consequence of the last one, in 1964–65, about 20,000 babies were born with serious birth defects and an additional 30,000 pregnancies ended in spontaneous abortions and stillbirths. Nationwide epidemics have occurred roughly once a decade on the average The current Government objective is to immunize 60 million pre adolescent children by mid 1975. Presumably the time table would be accelerated if signs of an impending epidemic appeared. A spokesman for the National Communicable Disease Center in Atlanta estimated recently that 10 million children would be vaccinated by the end of June in public programs and an additional two million, roughly by physicians in private practice. Supplies of the vaccine are expected to rise soon and prices decline because a third manufacturer has just been licensed. The new license has been awarded to Smith Kline & French Laboratories' Bel gian subsidiary, Recherche et Industrie Therapeutiques, which manufactures it abroad. The first United States license for a live virus rubella vaccine was awarded last year to Merck Sharp & Dohme. The second went to Philips Roxane Laboratories, Inc. It is estimated that each concern will reach a produc tion capacity of two million doses a month. So far prices have been variable. The Iast Iarge lot pur chased by the Government after competitive bidding came to about $1 a shot for 50‐ dose packages, according to an official at the Com municable Disease Center. Smaller lots purchased privately are presumably higher. A spokesman for the center said New York City had re ported reaching about 26 per cent of its target population of 1,259,000 children aged 1 to 10; while New York State, outside the city, has reported vaccina tion of about 12 per cent of those in a somewhat broader age group—1 to 12. The infection, also called German measles, is relatively mild in children and adults, but gften produces disastrous ef fects on the fetus when a woman is infected early in preg nancy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Abortion Reform Has Only a Fighting Chance,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/22/archives/abortion-reform-has-only-a-fighting-chance.html,"ALBANY—The historic 31‐to 26 vote by which the Senate passed the abortion reform bill last week only set the stage for an even more intense struggle in the Assembly where the con cept has been rejected for four consecutive years.  The sponsors of retonn in the Assembly are “cautiously opti mistic.” They do not have in hand yet a head‐count of votes that tells them the bill will pass. And, it is increasingly clear that the climate of emotion which the Senate vote reflected has merely heightened the emotions of opponents of the bill. Immediately after passage of the bill in the Senate, the twin lobbies in opposition — the Catholic Church and the Medi cal Society of the State of New York, which had been relatively quiet up to this point—took up the issue. The doctors registered “strong opposition” while the bishops of New York State de nounced the bill as a destruction of “the right to life.” Few issues have as deeply touched the private feelings of individual members of the Leg islature, members more com fortable with questions of hard cash and political maneuvering. In the dispassionate words of law the issue is very simple. Presently a woman may abort a pregnancy only if a licensed physician says it is necessary to save her life. The proposed law would allow an abortion to be performed if a woman and her doctor agree that it should be performed — there would be no restrictions such as residency requirements or length of preg nancy. ‘Abortion Mills’ Feared The opposition is equally sim ple. Many doctors fear that the lack of any restrictions will fos ter “abortion mills” in the state. The Catholic Church considers abortions simply as murders. While few doctors have lob bied against the bill directly, the Catholic Church has main tained consistent pressure on the Legislature on this issue over the years. A key factor in Senate passage of the bill was the relative absence of church pressure on individual members —a fact reflected by the four Catholics who voted in favor of reform. Though there has been no slowdown in the number of pas toral letters issued by the Church condemning reform, the fact is that their efforts have been dissipated by other legis lative matters. Currently the Church is negotiating with the Governor and the Legislature not only to repeal the section of the state constitution that for bids state aid to church‐related schools, but also to push through legislation that will, provide up to $20‐million in state aid to parochial schools. Mobilization of support from lay Catholics for this effort has been extreme ly successful. Recently, Catholics from Long Island jammed the lobby of the Senate to cheer Sen. Edward J. Speno, a Long Island Republi can, and a Catholic, who is pushing for more state money for parochial schools. While Mr. Speno has attracted strong Church support in this effort, he felt free enough of pressure to cast one of the Catholic votes for abortion reform. National Trend A good deal of this also re flects the general trend nation ally toward abortion reform a trend that each year places more Catholics in opposition to their church on the issue. Most states, including New York, have laws rooted in the social de mands of the 19th century when the lack of medical knowledge dictated that child birth was less risky than an abortion with its attendant possibility of in fection. It was a time, too, when technological development and westward expansion favored large families. All these trends have been reversed now and the growing pressures of population and unequal distribution of wealth have led to a growing for population control. The poor, the disadvantaged, and the rising militancy among women has carried the argu ment for reform through the 50 states. Since Colorado took the lead in 1967 and reformed its abortion laws, 10 other states have eased restrictions on abor tions. This year, Hawaii passed the most liberal law to date—a law similar to the New York pro posal except that it contains residency requirement of 90 days — and other states are taking up the question. On the same day that the New York State Senate acted, Maryland's House of Delegates passed a similar law. That bill, too, faces an uncertain future in the other legislative house. As much as anything else, it is this clear and growing trend that concerns some opponents to New York's law. Sen. Earl W. Brydges, the chief opponent to reform in New York, made this clear during last week's debate: “I have a deep, real, abiding conviction that this is the wrong way for the state to go because we are a bellwether state and many other states will follow our lead.” “That may be true,” one sup porter of reform responded lat er, “but it seems to me that other states have already acted and New York is slowly becom ing less a leader than a holdout in matters of social reform. We'll find out next week when the Assembly acts.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3 REFORM PLANS PASS IN VIRGINIA,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/23/archives/3-reform-plans-pass-in-virginia-fiscal-electoral-abortion-bills.html,"RICHMOND, March 22—Vir ginians will decide Nov. 3 whether to accept an updated streamlined Constitution pro viding for expanded borrowing power, a sharp break, if it is approved, with the traditional pay‐as‐you‐go fiscal policy enunciated by the late Senator Harry F. Byrd. The state's legislature, which completed its biennial 60‐day session last Sunday, approved for the necessary second time its action in sending the pro posed constitutional revisions to the voters in referendum. The changes would reduce the State Constitution from about 35,000 words to 18,000 words and do away with such anachronisms as a prohibition against dueling. They would also provide for annual, instead of biennial, sessions of the leg islature. Among other actions, the General Assembly passed an election reform bill severely re stricting absentee balloting by mail. The move was intended to alleviate what has long been the subject of fraud allegations, particularly in the southwestern section of the Commonwealth. The legislature also voted to liberalize the state's 123‐year‐ old abortion law, under which the operation had been permit ted only if the mother's health was imperiled. The lawmakers approved a bill allowing an abortion if the mental or physical health of the mother or child is threaten ed or if pregnancy result ed from forcible rape or in cest. To keep the state from be coming what some opponents called an “abortion mill,” the bill establishes a four‐month residency requirement. It also requires that abortions must not be performed unless recom mended by a medical review board at an approved hospital. On March 27 the legisla ture's presiding officers will formally sign the bills and send them on to Gov. Linwood Holt on, who must sign or veto each within 10 days. The Re publican Governor has indicat ed he will sign both the abor tion and electoral reform meas ures. The legislators also approved a record budget for the bienni um beginning July 1. The total outlay, $3.87‐billion, will be 31 per cent higher than the figure for the preceding two years. Potamac Pact Ratified In other action, the Assembly: ¶Ratified a Potomac River Basin compact among four states (Virginia, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Maryland) and the District of Columbia for joint management of the basin on such matters as flood con trol, pollution and zoning for the next 100 years. Virginia is the first of the five jurisdic tions to ratify the agreement. ¶Passed legislation tightening, controls on both air and water pollution. ¶Tightened conflict‐of‐inter est laws and passed a bill that includes members of the legis lature among those subject to penalties. ¶Took note of consumer pro tection by creating the position of Administrator of Consumer Affairs under the Department of Agriculture and Commerce and establishing a Division of Consumer Counsel in the At torney General's office. Among the new revenue measures, only one provides for increased taxes. The lawmak ers raised the 10 per cent tax on liquor sold in state stores tea 14 per cent. The legislature killed a pro posed 2‐cents‐a‐gallon state tax increase (from 7 to 9 cents) on gasoline and also killed a bill backed by Governor Holton un der which Virginia's per‐pack tax on cigarettes would have doubled from 2½ to 5 cents. A bill that would have elim inated “Carry Me Back to Old Virginia” as the official state song was also rejected. A Negro Senator from Rich mond, Lawrence Douglas Wild er, had introduced the bill, con tending that such lines as “That's where this old darky's heart has long'd to go” and “there's where I labored so hard for Old Massa” un justifiably extol the joys and virtues of slavery. 3 Soviet Ships Pass Turkey ISTANBUL, Turkey, March 22 (AP)—A Soviet cruiser, escorted by two destroyers, entered the Mediterranean today through the Turkish straits.

ABORTION RUSH ON IN HAWAII CLINICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/23/archives/abortion-rush-on-in-hawaii-clinics-one-hospital-performs-46-in.html,"HONOLULU, March 22 — Hawaii's maternity wards have taken on heavy workloads with the liberalization of the state's abortion law. In the first full week since the new statute went into ef fect, the Kapiolani Maternity and Gynecological Hospital per formed 46 abortions. This compares with only 70 therapeutic abortions (the only kind permitted under the old law) during the entire period from Feb. 1, 1969 to Jan. 1, 1970. Kapiolani is expected to han dle most of the operations un der the new law, but other hospitals reported an increase as well. At Queen's Medical Center, the state's largest hospital fa cility, 13 abortions were per formed in the last week, compared to a rate of about two a month before. Most of Law Amended Hawaii modified its 101‐year‐ old abortion law on March 11, repealing almost all sections of the old law. Now the only re quirements are that the opera tion be approved by a licensed physician and performed in a licensed hospital after a 90‐day waiting period. The administrator at Kapio lani, Richard Davi, said earlier in the week that the hospital could perform only 32 abor tions a week because “we have so many other surgical cases to handle.” But provision for the addi tional 14 abortions finally had to be made because of heairy pressure from doctors, who have been besieged by requests. Mr. Davi said most of the women applying at his hospital appeared to be very young. Mrs. Ruth Ono, assistant ad ministrator of Queen's Medical Center, said Most of those who telephoned for information (in cluding some calls from the mainland) sounded “desperate.” Meanwhile, a new contro versey arose during the week when the chief proponent of the abortion reforms, State Sen ator Vincent Yano, charged that the state's biggest medical in surance carrier was discriminat ing against single girls. More Than 300,000 Members The Hawaii Medical Service Association does not provide maternity or related benefits for single women and never has. It has more than 300,000 members out of a total state wide population of about 830,000. Senator Yano said the atti tude of the association toward abortions for single women was “inconsistent in relation to the philosophy of the new law because of its discriminat ing attitude against unmarried women.” The Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, on the other hand, covers both single and married wo men. It provides for outpatient treatment at $135 under a group plan or $270 for non members or those on individual plans. The charges for those requir ing overnight hospitalization will be $160 for those in group plans and $320 for others. Senator Yano said: “A seri ous question seems to be raised here in view of the fact that the Kaiser Health Plan does cover single and married wo men equally for maternity and abortion procedures.” The Senator said he would challenge the discrepancy be tween the two health plans. He is chairman of the Senate Public Health Committee. By the end of last week, as sociation spokesmen said that it was giving serious considera tion to providing abortion cov erage for single women. Kapiolani is setting up out patient procedures that it hopes will be able to cope with the increased workload without departing from strict guide lines. These provide that only spe cialists with major obstetrical and gynecological privileges may perform abortions at the hospital.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Assembly Committee Restricts Senate's Abortion Reform Bill,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/24/archives/assembly-committee-restricts-senates-abortion-reform-bill.html,"ALBANY, March 23—An As sembly committee today placed amendments on the Senate passed abortion‐reform bill to restrict abortions performed after the 24th week of preg nancy. The bill, as passed by the Senate last week after long and emotional debate, would have been the most liberal abortion law in the country, permitting abortions any time a doctor and the prospective mother agreed one should be per formed. Present law permits abortion only when necessary to save the life of the prospec tive mother. Th Assembly Codes Com mittee—with the agreement of the key sponsors of the reform bill—amended the Senate's bill to prohibit abortions after 24 weeks from conception unless necessary “to save the life of the mother.” The vote on the amendment in committee was 13 to 7. Observers believe the likeli hood that the bill will pass the Assembly has been increased. Debate Is Postponed Originally Assembly sponsors had hoped to debate the meas ure this week, but the leader ship has planned to take up the Governor's 7.3‐billion budget either Wednesday or Thursday. Because Friday is Good Friday and Sunday is Easter Sunday, Assembly Speaker Perry B. Din‐yea Jr. decided not to push for debate of the measure this week. Senators who vote for the more liberal version of the bill said today they expected little trouble passing the amended, version if it won Assembly approval. The action an the abortion bill dominated, the legislative day as most legislators were distracted by the confusion gen erated by the continuing mail strike. Democratic leaders, however, anticipating the budget debate this week, presented a plan to provide a $58.8‐million cut back in spending from the Gov ernor's budget. They also pro posed a net increase in the budget of $330‐million for edu ration and welfare. Higher Taxes Favored The additional money, Demo mats said, could be raised through a tax‐reform package Introduced earlier calling for increased corporate taxes and higher taxes on wealthy indi viduals. Neither program is ex pected to receive the attention of the Republican‐dominated Legislature. In the Senate a minor debate was generated by a resolution calling on the Governor to designate March 25 “Hellenic Day.” Several members ob jected to language in the reso lution stating that “Greece, even today, is in the forefront of the fight for democracy.” Senator Manfred Ohrenstein, a Manhattan Democrat, called the present Greek Government a “dictatorship in the worst tradition.” The resolution passed with little trouble. Other actions In the Legisla ture included: VIETNAM WITHDRAWAL A resolution to put the Legis lature on record as committed to the immediate withdrawal of all American troops from South Vietnam was roundly defeated in the Assembly. The resolution was sponsored by Assembly man Franz S. J. Leichter, Demo crat of Manhattan. BABY FOOD A bill banning the use of the food additive monosodium glu tamate in all baby foods sold in the state was passed in the As sembly and sent to the Senate. Assemblyman Leonard P. Sta visky, a Queens Democrat, said that the legislation was prompt ed by recent scientific studies indicating that the additive could be harmful to children. “If the additive is eventually proven safe,” he said, “the ban can easily be rescinded.” MSG is primarily used in vegetable and meat mixtures. When the reports came out showing brain damage to mice fed the additive during infancy most baby‐food companies vol untarily removed the ingredient from their products. SAFETY ON BOATS Owners of rowboats, canoes and other pleasure craft will be required to carry adequate life saving devices under a bill passed in the Assembly and sent to the Senate after a brief de bate. PROBATION BAN The Assembly passed and sent to the Senate a bill barring probation for defendants who have been convicted of selling “a dangerous drug.” The bill exempts those who sell mari juana. GLUE‐SNIFFING A bill passed in the Assem bly requiring the addition of oil of mustard to airplane glue, in an attempt to curb the use of the product by teen‐agers to get a quick “high.” The addition of oil of mustard would cause the user's eyes to tear and would cause a burning sensa tion in the nose.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rogers said at a news conference that the United States felt that Israel's air capacity was sufficient for the present and would “hold in abeyance for now” any decision on Israel's request to purchase 125 jets. Mr. Rogers went on to say that the United States had no intention of jeopardizing Israel's security. [1:1.] The Israeli Foreign Minister, Abba Eban, ex pressed his nation's “disappointment and concern” with the decision, but called for reappraisal of the arms balance in the Mid dle East as Mr. Nixon promised. (1:2.] The Secretary also disclosed at his news conference that President Nixon had sent another letter to Premier Aleksei N. Kosygin of the Soviet Union urging international consultations to resolve the crisis in Laos. Sources in Washington said that the letter, the second on the subject of Laos was “tough” in tone. I. 1:3.] Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who was de posed as Cambodia's Chief of State last week, proclaimed the dissolution for “high treason” of the government in his country and announced the formation of a “national union government” and a “national libera tion army.” The Prince issued his statement in Peking. [1:1–2.] National The Supreme Court held that welfare re cipients have the right to a formal hearing with trial‐like constitutional safeguards be fore their benefits may be cut off. By 5‐to‐3 margin the Court declared New York and California procedures violate the require ment of “due process of law” and thus are unconstitutional. [1:1.] Senator Edmund S. Muskie sent a letter to Interior Secretary Walter J. Hickel asking the Secretary intended to take legal action against the Chevron Oil Company as a fol low‐up to his charge that the company was violating offshore chilling regulations on its oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. One of the rigs has been leaking oil into the Gulf since it caught fire last month. [27:1–6.] Two officers and 14 enlisted men have been charged by the Air Force with various crimes including larceny, bribery, extor tion and other offenses in connection with the operation of servicemen's clubs in Thailand. The charges stemmed from an investigation into, the operations of the clubs that has been going on since last fall.

Murtagh to allow the pretrial hearings of the 13 Black Panthers to be resumed with the use of closed circuit television if the Panthers continue in their refusal to promise to behave in court. E31:1–7.] The abortion‐reform bill passed by the State Senate was amended by an Assembly committee to limit abortions performed after the 24th week of pregnancy. The original version permitted abortions at any time. Observers felt that the committee's action greatly increased the bill's chance of passage in the full Assembly.

Women's Liberation Taking to the Stage,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/26/archives/womens-liberation-taking-to-the-stage.html,"ONE is a suburban housewife, on the brink or middle age and ablaze with a rage from within. The other is a young law student's wife, recently pregnant and outward ly serene. They have written and composed the first wo men's liberation musical, the first to be produced above ground at least. “The Mod Donna,” which opens May 1 at The New York Shake speare Festival Public The ater, is being directed and produced by Joseph Papp, the zealous prophet of free Shakespeare in Central Park and the original impresario of “Hair,” the rock musical. “There's been a little ani mosity from some women in the movement because I took a male director,” said Myrna Lamb, the writing member of the team, during a break in rehearsals. There was both joy and anguish in her almond shaped brown eyes, and the toss of her mahogany‐colored mane. Her earth‐mother form was loosely upholstered in a brown knit pants suit and her strong, gesticulating hands were bare of a wedding ring. Calls Herself Feminist “I'm a feminist but I can't be a female chauvinist. I'm very alienated. I always try to belong and I never can. It's never comfortable for me. I don't like anyone telling me what to do even if it's wom en's liberation,” she said in a lyrical voice that carried the menace of a volcano that has been erupting intermittently for 39 years going on 40. All but the first 17 of those years have been circumscribed by marriage and motherhood, two institutions that the women's liberation movement has every intention of altering by reform revolution. “The Mod Donna” blends two marriages, one repre senting power, the other sub servience, into “a macabre ménage à trois” in which the serving girl agrees to bear children for the other couple, explained Myrna Lamb. She has two daughters, 14 and 20, by Marvin Epstein of Nutley, N. J., a food sales man who is her first and only husband although, as a femi nist, she refuses to use his name. “I want to be just me, Myrna. And I'm not Miss Lamb either. Use of Name Her collaborator nodded vigorously. “I would never introduce myself as Mrs. Timothy Bingham. I'm Susan Bingham or Susan Rulsman Bingham,” said the 25‐year‐ old concert pianist who com posed the music for “The Mod Donna” in an apartment in New Haven, Conn., where she lives with her husband of a year and a half. A Yale law student, he is the son of Representative Jonathan Bingham, the Democratic Bronx Congressman. “I'm not militant because my experience has been so good. I feel my marriage is as free as it can be,” said Susan Bingham, looking half her age and not the lease rebellious in a beige tweed A‐line dress and beige suede boots. A thin platinum wedding band was matched to a modest diamond soli taire on the third finger of her left hand. The writer and the com poser met last summer at Mr. Papp's Experimental Theater. Susan Bingham, a Boston banker's daughter, had written the music for review put on by a group of Yale drama students. Myrna Lamb, Whose father was a motor vehicle inspec tor in Newark, was involved with The New Feminist Thea tre through her abortion play, “But What Have You Done For Me Lately,” in which a man was impreg nated and had to submit his frantic plea for an abortion to a board of women. “It was no play,” Myrna Lamb said. “It was mother's rage. I wrote it because my daughter suspected she was pregnant. She wasn't. But it put me in a rage.” “I understand what Myrna feels even though I don't have the venom. I don't disagree with her,” Susan Bingham said. She is expecting her first child next September. Meanwhile she and her hus band are discussing the divi sion of child care. So far it is certain that he will help out at bedtime and that his mother will baby‐sit. “You've got what I would have settled for,” Myrna said to Susan. “Your marriage is rather sensible, an intelligent rapport between like human beings. “I'm the older generation,” she went on. “My husband is 48, a World War II veteran. It was a different culture wasn't allowed to do anything but be a housewife.” But she tried, as an actress, a suburban newspaper writer, a proofreader. “The Mod Donna,” Joseph Papp said, “is an oratorio, one woman's cry, the personal pain she feels. “But as ideology, I feel it's an important statement to make today about the rela tions between men and wom en and about the state of women,” he asserted. The Donna in the title is a servant girl married to a War veteran named Charlie who doesn't think he can make it in the system ex cept by living through his boss. “If his wife does a little something for the boss, he'll look away.” Myrna Lamb said. The boss is rich and pow erful and married to a lady. “He like to play a game where he gives his power to her but only in a well‐con trolled situation,” she said. The play contains a female symbolically crucified but no nudity, Mr. Papp said, “be cause I feel it would be wrong here. There is the nakedness of the idea in stead, a stripping away of things that are usually left unsaid.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BRITONS CRITICIZE ABORTION PRACTICES,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/26/archives/britons-criticize-abortion-practices.html,"LONDON, March 25—Sup porters of legal abortion today urged the disclosure of doctor's fees to prevent abuse of the British law making abortions available on a variety of social and medical grounds. In a report to Richard Cross man, the Social Services Secre tary, the abortion‐reform group also urged stricter control on private‐clinic abortions and checks on the number of foreign women in Britain for abortions. “It would appear that a few doctors are operating on a scale and at a rate which suggests that high profit may form stronger motivation than medi cal care,” said the group headed by David Steel, the Liberal Member of Parliament who sponsored the 1967 Abortion Act. “We are gravely concerned that women are receiving less than optimal treatment,” the report went on. Britain's liberalized Iaw— which was approved despite the opposition of some doctors and religious groups — legalizes abortion when two physicians find that continued pregnancy would involve risk to the life of the women or injury to her physical or mental health or that of existing children.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Morgenthau in Race For Governorship,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/27/archives/morgenthau-in-race-for-governorship-morgenthau-seeks-governorship.html,"Deputy Mayor Robert M. Morgenthau announced yester day that he was running for Governor, committed to smash ing the “closed systems” in state politics and government that he said benefited the fa vored few. In declaring for a race through the June 23 primary, Mr. Morgenthau became the sixth candidate actively seek ing the Democratic nomination for Governor. The others running for the nomination are Arthur J. Gold berg, Howard J. Samuels, Nas sau County Executive Eugenb H. Nickerson, William J. vanden Heuvel and Queens District At torney Thomas J. Mackell. “I am going to give the voters a chance to get back control of their party and then their state,” Mr. Morgenthau said. “In 12 weeks the voters—and only the voters—will decide whether I have won this fight.” Aware that his entry was late, Mr. Morgenthau said he was taking his campaign “into the state from now until June —whatever the state commit tee does.” The committee will pick a slate of statewide can didates next Wednesday, but its choices may be challenged in the primary. In becoming a candidate, Mr. Morgenthau said he had taken a leave of absence without pay from his $42,500‐a‐year post as Deputy Mayor at the sug gestion of Mayor Lindsay, who is now on a skiing holiday at Vail, Colo. A City Hall spokesman con firmed this and added, as had the candidate, that the Mayor, a Republican, “does not intend to become involved in the Democratic primary contest.” A former United States At torney for the Southern District of New York for nine years, Mr. Morgenthau, now 50 years old, recalled that he ran for Governor before and “fell flat on my face.” “But eight years ago, I ran as part of an aged political, process,” he said. “Today, eight years wiser, I run as a direct challenge to that process.” In the 1962 campaign, he got 2,552,418 votes — includ ing 242,675 on the Liberal line — to 3,081,587 for Gover nor Rockefeller, then bidding For a second term, on the Re publican line. While boasting a well‐known family name—his father, Henry, had been Secretary of the Treasury — Mr. Morgenthau was relatively unknown then and had not yet achieved at tention for his prosecutions aimed at organized crime. Fought ‘Closed System’ Mr. Morgenthau said yester day that he had tried while United States Attorney to “break the closed system” hav ing learned that “those who play at compromise lose their capacity to fight.” He said that no Governor could “open up the party an make participation work” if he had run as candidate who cares more about unity among the party leaders than the hopes and needs of the people.” Sworn in as a Deputy Mayor on Jan. 5, Mr. Morgenthau, who did not assume his duties until Feb. 15, said that he shared Mayor Lindsay's belief “that political considerations must be set aside when our city's future is at stake.” He twice avoided giving a direct answer then to the ques tion: “Is it your intention to remain in this administration through the full course of the Lindsay administration and do you rule out the possibility that you will seek the Democratic nomination for Governor?” Yesterday, Mr. Morgenthau said he had learned in the Lindsay administration and in work with the Mayors of the state's “Big Six” cities that urban needs best could be met at the state level. The congestion in the Demo cratic gubernatorial field was demonstrated at the Overseas Press Club when the Mr. Mor genthau's news conference ran into conflict with one held by another candidate, Nassau County Executive Eugene H. Nickerson. Although the Morgenthau conference started late, Mr. Nickerson deferred to the new entry and several hundred newsmen, staff members and guests milled around for, nearly two hours before both candi dates had finished with the press. Vincent L. Broderick, a for mer United States Attorney and later Police Commissioner, and Representative Edward I. Koch of Manhattan were among the Morgenthau supporters present. TEXT OF STATEMENT The text of Mr. Morgen thau's statement follows: I am running for Governor. I ran eight years ago and I fell flat on my face. But eight years ago I ran as part of an aged political process. Today, eight years wiser, run as a direct challenge to that process. Today, I run on my record as United States Attorney for nine years. The Democratic party is in trouble in New York. In 16 years, it has won, except for the Controller's office, only one state‐wide race — and that was Robert F. Kennedy's Senate victory in 1964. And New York State is also in trouble. There is too much that simply doesn't work. There is too much crime, and there is too much organized illegality fed and protected by official indiffer ence or worse. Even the children of the prominent and the poor alike live under abnormal pressure. They turn to the world of drugs. And their future is being strewn across a police blotter. Closed Systems Fundamentally, the Demo cratic party and New York State are in trouble for the same reason. They are closed systems which work for a handful of people, but offer very little to help most peo ple in their work and their lives. I have tried to break this closed system as United States Attorney. And I have seen those who play at com promise lose their capacity to fight. You cannot compromise with organized crime. You cannot compromise with the narcotics trafficker. You cannot compromise with those who pollute the world their children will in herit. You cannot be a Governor who will open up the party and make participation work if you run as a candidate who cares more about unity among the party leaders than the hopes and needs of the people. Role of the People If this state is going to let people be a part of public life, that has to begin now in our party in the choice of candidates. If we think there is something wrong with decisions being made— about subway fares or judi cial reform, or abortion or housing — without the peo ple's choice, then there is also something wrong about putting together a ticket be hind closed doors. I am taking my campaign into the state from now un til June — whatever the state committee does. I am going to fight to give the voters a chance to get back control of their party and then their state. In 12 weeks the voters and only the voters — will decide whether I have won this fight.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ABORTION LAWS OPPOSED AT RALLY,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/29/archives/abortion-laws-opposed-at-rally-1500-demonstrators-march-along-34th.html,"More than 1,500 demonstra tors, most of them young, white and female and wearing bell bottom pants, startled Easter shoppers yesterday afternoon by marching across 34th Street to protest abortion laws.  The march, from First Avenue to Broadway, was part of a day long series of demonstrations organized by People to Abolish Abortion Laws, a coalition of groups including many militant feminist organizations and sev eral Manhattan Democratic clubs. The day started with a small rally at 10:45 A.M. on the steps of St. Patrick's Cathedral, on Fifth Avenue at 50th Street Marchers later assembled near. Bellevue Hospital on First Ave nue at 23d Street and paraded up to 34th Street, through the, heart of the shopping district to Broadway and then down to Union Square, where a crowd of about 2,500 people attended al rally that began at 2:30 P.M. One Woman Arrested There was one arrest. As the head of the line of march ap proached Union Square at 17th Street, several demonstrators spilled out into the street, block ing traffic. The police arrested one of them, 26‐year‐old Karen Simon of 319 West 84th Street. She was taken to the East 21st Street station and charged with disorderly conduct and ob structing traffic. The parade of chanting, sing ing demonstrators, which at one point stretched from First Ave nue all the way to Broadway along 34th Street, took onlook ers by surprise. Among the dissenters was Mrs. Veronica Clancy, a mother of three who watched the dem onstrators chant, “Up from un der, women unite” outside of Ohrbach's. “Where would these people be if their mothers had had abortions?” asked Mrs. Clancy, who lives in Greenwich Village. Spokesmen for the demon strators said they would con tinue to press for an end to all abortion laws even if the abor tion reform bill recently ap proved by the New York State Senate became law. The present law allows an abortion only when a woman's life is in danger. The bill passed by the Senate would allow abortions without restrictions, provided a woman and her physician agree an abortion is necessary. “There is no need for any legislation on abortion just as there is no need for legislation on an appendectomy,” said Florynce R. Kennedy, a lawyer active in civil rights and civil liberties cases, who spoke at the St. Patrick's rally. At the St. Patrick's rally, red coat hangers were handed out by some demonstrators who said they symbolized both a method of performing illegal abortions and the fact that women are more concerned about clothes than women's rights. The church was chosen for the rally, the demonstrators said, because of the Roman Catholic hierarchy's opposition to abortion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Better Earth,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/29/archives/the-better-earth-a-report-on-ecology-action-a-brash-activist.html,"BERKELEY, Calif. THE house at 3029 Benvenue is out of an earlier, quieter time. High‐pitched roof; brown shin gles; large, airy rooms; bright flowers in the yard. It is the kind of house that sends real‐estate developers scurrying for their adding machines, their heads whirling with estimates on how many cinder‐block apart ments they could cram onto the lot. Near the door, drawn in black script on white cardboard, is this sign: “If you came by car to Benvenue, in the future we would appreciate it very much if you would come by some alternate locomotion—walking, bi cycle or public transportation. If coming by car is unavoidable, please remember, as a courtesy to neighbors who would like us to minimize noise and fumes, to park on College (near Woolsey is generally easy) and to walk around to the house. Enjoy the walk!” This is the headquarters of Ecology Action, one of dozens of groups now fighting the battle for a better en vironment in the San Francisco Bay area. What makes Ecology Action different is its style—brash, activist, radical. If the Sierra Club is the N.A.A.C.P. of environmental groups, Ecology Action is a cross between SNCC—when it was still nonviolent —and the Yippies. Its activists gen erally share neither the bitterness nor the violence of some New Left ists; they'd sooner say, “Enjoy the walk,” than scream, “Up against the wall.” Ecology Action was started by Cliff Humphrey, a student of archeol ogy, and some friends two years ago, long before even the sophisticated denizens of Berkeley (which has been called “one big social labora tory”) knew what “ecology” meant— the study of man's relationship to his environment. “When Cliff first started talking ecology,” says his wife, Mary, in a voice still reminis cent of her Boston Irish heritage, “they thought he was an idiot.” But today, Ecology Actionists find themselves riding a tidal wave of in terest in the environment, a wave that threatens to drown them even as it hurtles them toward prominence. Each day's mail—It is carted from the Post Office by bike—contains flood of requests for information, lit erature or speakers. Humphrey likes to talk about Ecology Action as “a movement rather than an organiza tion,” and local groups—there are more than 100, and new ones form weekly — are virtually autonomous. But they invariably look to the founding fathers for guidance, and the pressures are enormous. The house on Benvenue provides office space as well as living quarters for the Humphreys and about 10 full‐time volunteers. Many of them are conscientious objectors who — with the approval of their draft boards after the state decided that the project served the national interest — are performing their two years of alternate service. The center of activity in the house is the basement. After getting past the sign at the door, the visitor is confronted with a large poster of a noble, if somewhat apprehensive, Indian. The first Americans have become the culture heroes of the ecology movement. As Mary ex plained, “the Indians lived in harmony with this country and they had a reverence for the things they depended on.” There were petitions to sign—against smog and a new bridge over the Bay, for the “valid claims” of the Indians on Alcatraz— and a cannister for contributions to the “Planet Earth Defense Fund.” A hand‐printed sign warned: “We are already five years into the biosphere self‐destruct era.” CLIFT and I went upstairs to talk. He is 32 but looks older, with rough complexion and longish, sandy hair. He was dressed in a beige knit shirt, adorned with dirt spots and little hole, and brown slacks; on his belt he wore a leather holster that carried a notebook. After junior college training in engineering and three years in the Army he worked, he hesitates to admit, checking free way construction as an inspector for the State Division of Highways. He went back to the University of Cali fornia here to study archeology, and in his first course wrote a paper on the Cheyenne Indians. “That was the switch, right there,” he explained in his rapid, excitable way. “A lot of things fell into place. I realized the importance of ecology—and the rela tion of the Plains Indians to their environment.” The era of confronta tion politics was starting in the Bay area, and Humphrey, although never a leader, was “in the streets” for many of the antiwar, antiuniversity demonstrations. A combination of these political activities and his aca demic interests led to the formation of Ecology Action. The basic point, Humphrey said, “is that the biosphere, the life‐sup port system for the earth, is finite and fragile. Once you understand that, the ethics of the movement follow. Through the fifties and six ties, the basic premise of our society was that growth was good—bigger and better everything! But now that premise is changing, it's being re placed by an idea more simple and more universal: the ability of the planet to support life can't be di minished. You can have complete freedom as long as you don't destroy the common life‐sup port system. “Everywhere I speak I say we have a vested interest in our own destruction,” Hum phrey went on. “When the stock market goes up it is a signal device warning us of the imminent destruction of some part of the environment. Capitalism is predicated on money and growth, and when you're only interested to maximize profits, you maxi mize pollution. We need a system that takes maximum of the earth.” Despite such statements, Humphrey is hardly a doc trinaire Marxist or a knee jerk. America ‐ hater. He is simply an ecologist, and ecol ogists tend to ignore political barriers; their enemy is man himself. “You can't really blame the stock market,” Humphrey con tinued. “Our culture evolved in almost total ignorance of ecological absolutes. The New Left rhetoric is so simplistic. There was no conspiracy to get us into this mess. People in the establishment never had a choice. Henry Ford never realized when he started the assembly line that in 1970 people in Los Angeles would be dying from emphysema caused by his cars. But inject ing our new understanding into an old value system will cause a lot of tragedy. Take a guy who owns a hardware store. He's probably honest as the day is long—he'd run after you with your change. But his idea is to maximize his profit. How do you tell him that if the best interests of the people were considered, he should probably sell as little as possible?” This is one of the great de bates in the ecology move ment: Growth vs. the Good Life, Quantity vs. Quality. Most Americans, it seems, still believe that technology can eradicate the problems it has caused. As Dr. Lee S. Du Bridge, President Nixon's sci ence adviser, told a confer ence in Los Angeles recently: “I strongly reject the idea that we have to destroy our technological civilization, de flate and decrease the stand ard of living, to improve the quality of life. There may be a few who would like to re turn to the days of the cave man, but most of us believe that men live healthier, more pleasant lives than they did 10,000 years ago, or even 100 years ago.” Cliff Humphrey thinks Du Bridge is not only wrong, but irrelevant. What he and many ecologists believe is that so ciety must undergo a “cultural transformation,” a move away from the ideals of growth, consumption and progress. “At this moment, Western society is having a cumulative impact on the planet,” he explained. “If we continue this way we'll run the life ‐ support system down to zero. Survival can't be voted into existence, it has to be lived.” FOR the Humphreys, ecologi cal soundness begins at home. The residents of Benvenue live on a budget of about $1,500 a month, including $500 for mortgage payments. The $4,000 down‐payment on the house, like almost all their income, came from donations, which are seldom enough. “We spend zero for salaries,” Humphrey said. “If we have to fix a bike, or someone needs a new pair of pants, we do it, but no salaries.” The household is now down to two gasoline‐powered cars, one truck — which runs on propane gas—and eight bikes. They have to allow more time for travel than they would with a more conven tional fleet, but there are ad vantages. “The pace has got ten so fast around here there is a great lack of privacy,” Cliff said. “Now most of the time the family is together is when we're traveling around on some public transportation system.” Mary has four chil dren, but she quickly points out that three are by a previous marriage and don't live with them. “Cliff's not guilty, he has only one nat ural‐born son,” she says, as if one were about to question his ecological credentials. The house buys food in bulk when it can—rice, sugar and flour are available—both to save money and to avoid the containers that hold pre packaged foods. Plastics, in particular, are shunned be cause they're virtually inde structible. Residents of the house take along their own shopping bags or knapsacks to carry their purchases; when they have to accept paper bags they usually return them to the store. Several Ecology Actionists startled a grocer the other day when they bought some potato chips for a picnic, emptied the con tents into their own bags and returned the wrappers on the spot. Though the returnable glass bottle is about as rare these days, as a beach without oil, the house finally found a dairy that will deliver milk in reusable containers (waxed paper cartons are almost as hardy as plastic). All cans are crushed and saved in two boxes — one for tin‐plated steel, one for aluminum—and eventually sold for recycling. Paper is also divided into categories — newsprint, maga zines and “mixed”—then re sold. All glass that cannot be returned is broken for easy storage, then sold. The organic garbage is buried in the backyard with lawn cuttings to form a com post heap that will eventually decay and enrich the soil. The yard is not big enough for a garden, however, and the group is looking for some land outside town on which to grow their own vegetables— without pesticides, of course. The group members also bake their own bread, which is cheaper and healthier than the store‐bought kind, but they are not maniacal about health foods (witness the po tato chips). The use of drugs is a per sonal decision. Cliff says he has tried marijuana and de cided “it does nothing for me,” but others feel that such drugs as mescaline, widely known as a “good high,” im proved their sensitivity to na ture and the “unity of all living things.” Considerable energy is spent conserving other kinds of re sources. Most of the Ecology Actionists' clothes are candi dates for the rag bag—Mary wears a uniform of a red shirt, denim skirt and hiking boots, all spotted with white paint—and everything is re paired until it is totally un usable. The toilet tank is filled with bricks; less water is allowed in, and thus wasted, with each flush. Residents are also urged not to bathe every day, and some cynics feel this precept helps account for ecology's popularity among the young. Old pieces of machinery are saved. One resident recently made a new bike from used parts, but the amateur me chanics of Benvenue tried to fix a car with a second‐hand clutch plate recently and realized only after four hours' work that they had the wrong size. Driving is con sidered a rather sinful act, and when someone does take a car out he usually runs a long list of errands to avoid wasteful trips. When the temperature drops, residents put on sweaters instead of turning up the heat. The office is another bas tion of economy. The mail boxes are old tin cans. Enve lopes are opened carefully, then reused—with the legend: “Save trees, reuse envelopes.” “It won't save a hell of a lot of trees,” Cliff concedes, “but it is a conspicuous act of conscience.” Much of the or ganization's literature is printed on paper donated by other groups; when I was there, a stack of old com puter paper about three feet high was standing in the hall, awaiting reuse. Sometimes second‐hand paper already has a message on one side, and that can cause problems. A batch of ecological tracts showed up at a local high school recently with a Black Panther harangue on the back, and a teacher was almost fired. A growing number of peo ple around Berkeley practice some of these tricks, but few are as devoted as the Ecology Actionists. Benvenue has be come a sort of moral touch stone for the movement. “Ev erytime I go visit the Hum phreys,” said one girl in ob vious discomfort, “they make me feel like a pig.” Despite the economy meas ures, money is always scarce, and the group is beginning to look for foundation support. “We're exploring what jobs we can do,” Humphrey added. “We might go paint a house together, or learn to convert vehicles to propane, but we won't do it unless we have to We'd rather stay small and a little on the hungry side.” In addition to the Hum phreys, the residents include one other married couple. The rest are young men, most of whom would like to see the sexual imbalance corrected. “It's a little too much like the Boy Scouts,” one complained. Each volunteer is develop ing a specialty—recycling ma terials, fund‐raising, speech making—but the group seems to take its character from Humphrey. In line with his theory that survival has to be lived, Ecology Action has staged a series of demonstra tions — a sort of guerrilla theater — to dramatize the crisis. One of the Humphreys' early extravaganzas was the public destruction last June of their 1958 Rambler station wagon — which, they quickly note, had a new transmission. “I saw myself talking about ecology and urging people to drive less, and here I had this car,” Cliff recalled with ob vious relish. “It was so great! We had a minister from some church in Berkeley read some thing from Isaiah about not worshiping the works of our hands. Then 1 ceremoniously raised the hood, removed the air filter and smashed the car buretor with a sledge ham mer.” Mary added, rather sheepishly: “We thought other people would give up their cars, too, but no one did.” The car‐smashing was fol lowed in September by Smog Free‐Locomotion Day, a dem onstration of fumeless alter natives to the automobile. Hundreds of people paraded through Berkeley on bikes, pogo sticks, stilts, roller skates, shopping carts, skate boards, baby carriages, golf carts and feet. A coffin on wheels, containing an internal combustion engine, led the line of march. ONE of the big issues here has been the gradual filling‐in of San Francisco Bay. A bill was introduced in the State Legislature to stop the prac tice, and ecologists of all stripes joined the fray. One Sunday, Ecology Actionists loaded 20 canvas money bags with mud—“unfilling the Bay” —and delivered them to com panies with Bay ‐ front real estate who want to continue the filling. The story won front‐page headlines. “Those executives had to face not just a bag of mud, but a bag of mud a million people knew about,” Hum phrey exulted. “If we're going to get the culture changed, each of us can't just have pri vate knowledge of the prob lem. Everyone has to know that everyone else knows — that they're being watched— it has to be a public thing.” The bill passed. Humphrey also worries that people are not adequately prepared for the next earth quake, and he is trying to warn them. Ecology Actionists invaded a breakfast given by Mayor Joseph Alioto com memorating the last San Fran cisco earthquake and handed out little black crosses. The group also staged a march along the Hayward Fault, an earthquake line running through Berkeley, and marked the route with purple crepe paper. It ran, Humphrey re called, through a hotel, a number of residence halls, the California School for the Blind and Deaf, the university football stadium and the Berkeley City Hall. In October, the group pro claimed Damn DDT Day in San Francisco. An Ecology Action volunteer, Kathy Rad ke, dressed as the Grim Reaper, carried a scythe in one hand and her three‐month old son in the other as she walked through the financial district at lunchtime. She was accompanied by Malvina Rey nolds, a folk singer, and sev eral people who handed out leaflets detailing the evils of the pesticides. “People pre tended not to notice,” Kathy remembered recently, “but caught them looking out of the corners of their eyes.” Ecology Action's antics have spawned imitators. At San Jose State College, for instance, students recently contributed $2,500 to buy a new yellow Maverick, which they buried at the climax of a week ‐ long “Survival Faire.” Some students complained that the burial was “ecologi cally unsound” because the car was not “biodegradable” —it would not return to its natural components. Black and chicano (Mexican‐Ameri can) students argued that the money could be better spent helping blacks and chi canos. In the end, a vote was taken and the car was buried after the students, at the chicanos' insistence, put a box of grapes in the back seat as a show of support for striking farm workers. Future demonstrations could get more disruptive. One idea is a “traffic seminar,” in which a large number of peo ple would drive to San Fran cisco early one morning and occupy all the parking places. The ensuing traffic jam, it is felt, would dramatize the need for more rapid‐transit facili ties. Now that ecology has be come so popular—the Sierra Club gets at least six job ap plications a day, and the editor of a music magazine was heard to say recently: “Someday ecology might be as important as rock ‘n’ roll” —one crucial job is to provide information on what people can do in their own lives. Ecology in Action has devel oped the concept of a “life house,” essentially an infor mation center for a neighbor hood. The operators of the “life house” would urge their neighbors to demand return able containers at the super market and tell them how to save refuse and sell it for recycling, to find soaps that do not contain phosphates, to garden without pesticides, form car pools, obtain free trees and plant them, get birth‐control information and generally reduce their con sumption. Several are func tioning in Berkeley and near by communities. As part of their information program, a contingent of Ecology Action ists are staging a six‐week march this spring through California's San Joaquin Val ley, stopping in each city to hold a fair or a meeting for local residents. Life on the ecology front these days is not always peaceful. The field is getting crowded, and some groups are on “power trips,” as the local jargon puts it. Hum phrey concedes that organiza tions “tend to horde money and good organizers,” but each faction is gradually working out its own role. For example, the Sierra Club, which fought so many con servation battles alone for so long, is now concentrating on legal actions and has more than 50 suits in the courts, including half a dozen against Cabinet officers. “If the Sierra Club didn't exist we would have to be much more struc tured,” Humphrey admits, “and we would have to get into some of the things they're doing. This way we have free dom to do what we want to do.” There are at least three major criticisms of Ecology Action's approach. One is that too many people are too enamored of the “throw‐away society” to make many changes in their lives. Hum phrey tacitly acknowledged this when he talked about high school students. “They're so much less rigid, they're open to new ideas,” he said. “They don't have any vested interests yet. They're not em ployed and they're not into buying cars.” The second criticism is that a “cultural transformation” and small personal acts might make people feel good, but won't have any significant impact on the chemical com panies, the auto manufac turers, the timber companies and other huge polluters of the environment. Humphrey and like‐minded ecologists an swer that these personal acts help build up a constituency for larger political acts. They point to the passage of the “Save the Bay” bill last spring and the defeat of the timber bill in Congress re cently as two examples of the growing political support for legislation that preserves the environment. Moreover, Hum phrey feels that if enough people use their power as consumers, they can affect corporate decisions. “There is no way they can make us consume,” he insists. But he also admits that there is a gap between what Ecology Action can achieve now and what needs to be done; he foresees the group's becoming more political and hopes to recruit some graduate stu dents doing basic research on environmental problems. The third criticism extends to all environmentalists. Isn't the new interest in ecology diverting energy and resources from the difficult and frustrat ing problems of the inner city? And hasn't President Nixon been able to “co‐opt” the movement by his rhetori cal, if not material, identifica tion with it? As to the first question, Humphrey and most other ecologists insist that the “en vironment” must include Watts as well as the red woods. “Anyone who doesn't still address himself to the old issues—housing, medicine, poverty—is not being honest,” he said. “It would be a bad scene if money were siphoned off from a housing program to pay for a park somewhere so that middle‐class people could have recreation.” But many in the movement also share the urgency of Stephanie Mills, the editor of a new magazine on ecology called Earth Times: “It would be the ultimate cop out to give all our money to the Black Panthers and then have them all die in 20 years because they couldn't drink the water.” One thing that continues to bother people, however, is that any slow down of the “growth econo my” would inevitably be most disastrous to those on the bot tom. Ecologists are in the un comfortable position of telling poor people that affluence and material comfort are not good for them. As for Nixon's “co‐opting” of the movement, few activists take him seriously. “There is a fantastic gap between what men like Nixon and Henry Ford are saying and what they're doing,” Humphrey said. “In any case, the Presi dent is talking about cleaning up some smoke and dirty water, but that's not what we're concerned with. We're concerned with a whole way of life.” ALL this does not fully ex plain the tremendous new in terest in environmental issues. To some extent it's a fad, especially among politicians. “A lot of them are the same guys who wore Davy Crock ett hats when they first came out,” said Melissa Shorrock, a recent Russell Sage graduate who is editing the proceedings of an ecology conference. But to many people, it is a very serious matter. One reason for their seriousness is that en vironmental problems affect everyone. Some are moved toward involvement by a new piece of information or a personal experience. Kathy Radke, who, with her husband, Ted, operates a “life house” in their hometown, Martinez, described her own conversion: “I was pregnant at the time and I read about DDT and mothers' milk. I was planning to nurse the baby, and it really upset me. The dosage in mothers' milk is greater than in cows' milk!” Ken Cantor, a Ph.D. in biology who works at the Ecology Center, a com bination book store and in formation clearing house in Berkeley, said: “The air pol lution around here has been increasing radically from year to year. You're bombarded every day with the fact that you can't see across the Bay anymore. And once one thing like that gets people upset, they start looking at other things, and their concern broadens.” Peggy Datz, who fled a teaching job in Detroit and now also works at the Ecology Center, thinks the moon shot last summer helped stimulate interest. “I don't think a lot of people under stood the concept of a finite life‐support system before,” she said. “You could see very clearly what the resources necessary for life were—they had them on their backs. You couldn't imagine a deus ex machina who would always be there.” Others talk about see ing the earth photographed from the moon and getting a new sense of its terrible fragility. Vietnam also helped in sev eral ways. “We got a lot of people who were totally frus trated by the old Peace and Freedom, S.D.S. kind of ac tivity,” Humphrey explained. “It's sad in a way, but we wouldn't have gotten such a start if so many people hadn't worried about the war for so many years and found them selves totally unable to get it stopped. There was a poten tial there for a new thrust. There really is only a limited attention span on any one issue, and all of a sudden here was another way to get it on, to make your concern known.” For others, Vietnam had nurtured a whole new political viewpoint. Steve Cotton, a Harvard law student on leave At to work on the Environmental Teach‐In April 22, explained: “Many people saw Vietnam as a tragic mistake in American foreign policy, but the more radical kids are saying that it was a natural outgrowth of a system that doesn't care about people, just about prof its, about its own expansion and nothing else. There has been a lot of thinking about the system, where it's going and what the alternatives are. Some of it is heavily ideologi cal, but a lot is just a vague sense of unease, of disquiet, that the whole thing is rush ing pell‐mell in the wrong di rection. Environment as the kids conceive it is an expres sion of that. They're not say ing this is a sanitation job, that if we spend enough money we'll scrub it all clean. They don't buy Nixon's rhe toric that this is a mistake or an oversight. The state of the environment is just another symptom of society's corrup tion, it's what the system is all about.” Jim Hunt, who graduated from Bates College in Maine last June and is now perform ing his alternate service at Benvenue, agrees with Cotton. For Hunt, Vietnam was a “steppingstone to ecology,” an experience that not only taught him “the incredible amount of energy wasted by the system,” but the potential power of grass‐roots senti ment. Once he came to Cali fornia, however, Hunt found that ecology was not just an other issue to make speeches and hold rallies about. “It had a profound effect on my life style,” said the youth, a na tive of New Britain, Conn., who edited the newspaper at Bates. “I began to see ways I could purify my life. When I came here there was nothing in my middle‐class back ground I was particularly against, but I began to see how a lot of things in my background could be very de structive—the love of gadgets, concern with speed and con venience. I had been troubled by some of these things, but I never really knew why, or that an alternative existed.” IN other words, for some youths ecology is not only a political but a cultural con cept, a new “way of life,” as Humphrey puts it, a way of fitting all one's dissatisfac tions and aspirations into a coherent structure. Like many similar movements, it also provides a community and a sense of purpose for young people who look at their fu ture with an apprehension bordering on terror. The act of giving up an automobile, or even burying the garbage, imparts a certain sense of ac complishment, even righteous ness. One young man who found a home at Benvenue is Gregory Voelm, who gradu ated last spring from Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, and is also working out his conscientious‐objector ob ligation. Soft‐spoken yet fiercely articulate, he describ ed what it was like to gradu are from college in June, 1969: “We were the first protest graduating class. . . . I was frightened of what lay before us. We had demonstrated and marched and screamed trying to change things, but it had never been real. Then all of a sudden we had to be part of that mess. . . .Everywhere I went, all I saw was plastic and McDonald's hamburger stands. I had a feeling of an overwhelmingly hostile envi ronment. I looked for adult models of how you could be happy, and it didn't look like you could. It was very freaky. I had the feeling that after graduation you dropped off the end of the world. Some of my friends went to Canada or Mexico, and others went to communes out in the country. Few of us considered begin ning a career—it was just too much to handle. There was a great feeling of meaningless ness, a search for something to grab hold of, some unifying thing, and I found it. Ecology is a good metaphor; it gives a unity to experience. “At first I thought recycling all that stuff was stupid, but when you do it you feel you are fitting into something, you're taking a positive step toward relating to your en vironment, and it feels good. What goes under the name of ecology is the answer to alien ation. We're alienated from nature and alienated from our ability to relate to each other, to love. But to break down that alienation between the individual and his environ ment is really a radical thing. When you destroy part of the environment, you have to real ize you're destroying part of yourself.” In some cases, the concept of ecology takes over a per son's whole life. For several years, Keith Lampe was an activist against the war, coun seling draft resistance; then he helped Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman form the Yip pies. After the Chicago con vention—he carried a tennis racket all week on the theory that the police “would think anyone who played tennis had money and connections”—he moved West with his wife, Judy, and their small daugh ter, looking for new causes. Allen Ginsberg first interested Lampe in ecology, and several months later his friend Gary Snyder, another poet, dragged him to a conference held by the Sierra Club. “That really put me over the hump,” re called Lampe, who was wear ing a bunch of plastic string beads around his neck and a little pigtail. “I realized that ecology would be my thing for a while.” Last spring, Lampe, who is in his late 30's, started an ecology newsletter called Earth Read‐Out, which he dis tributes to interested people and underground newspapers. But recently even that has not been satisfying. “I'm leaving for Colorado soon to look for some land,” he said, pacing up and down a kitchen that has a magnificent view of San Francisco Bay. “I have to get out of the typewriter thing and into reality. We take this population ‐ food squeeze very seriously, and we're going to go out and grow more food than we can consume. My wife has a trust fund, and we're in a position where we can afford to buy some land, so that's what we think we ought to do.” The conversa tion rambled, but every once in a while Lampe would look up and say: “It's amazing I could do that! Incredible! I'm going to be a farmer?” “The great thing about ecol ogy as a cause,” writes Art Hoppe, the columnist for The San Francisco Chronicle, “is that everybody's guilty.” And for people caught UD in the cause, it means a lot of hard decisions. The Lampes, for example, decided to have a legal abortion recently. “Hav ing only one child is to ecol ogy what unilateral withdraw al used to be to Vietnam,” he said with a laugh. “Having only two children is like fa voring a negotiated settle ment.” (Indeed, it's reached the point in some circles where mothers are made to feel like criminals. “Jesse Unruh said that environment is the motherhood issue of 1970,” remarked Ken Cantor during a discussion at the Ecology Center. “I guess he'll have to revise that; mother hood isn't very popular any more.” Peggy Datz replied, “Apple pie is still all right— as long as there are no cycla mates in it.”) KEITH LAMPE'S decision to leave the city for rural life is not unusual. Thousands of young people across the West have fled urban centers in re cent years and set up new communities in remote areas of Oregon, New Mexico, Colo rado and California. Their decisions flow from a current that is running very deep in American youth. It is a search for simplicity, for privacy, for meaningful work, for basic pleasures, for harmony with nature, for roots, for whole ness. In a world of piecemeal communities, they want per sonal communion; in a world of machines, they want magic; in a world of frozen foods and TV sets, they want to bake the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

r own bread and make their own music; in a world where there is never enough time, they want to take time; in a world of computers and as sembly lines, they want a place and a job that is their own; instead of concrete, they want trees; instead of money, they want joy; instead of sta tus, they want peace. In a world of fragments, they want to be put back together. Their search has shown itself in the furor over Peo ple's Park here in Berkeley— perhaps the first time many youths were able to create something entirely by them selves. It has shown itself in the phenomenal popularity of “The Whole Earth Catalogue” —the best‐selling book in both Berkeley and Cambridge —which contains innumerable suggestions on how to live off the land. And it has shown itself in the entire ecology movement, which in its high est sense is a search for the spiritual values buried by the advent of rationality and tech nology. “It is really a new religion,” Peggy Datz said. “I went camping in the Sierras last summer and we were three days from the nearest road. It did fantastic things for my head. I had a really mystical feeling about being part of a total living com munity.” Yet as ecologists are grop ing for a new spirituality, their world is shadowed by their keen perception of im pending doom. Everyone has his own scenario for how the world will end—hunger, suf focation, floods, ice. They are usually able to brush the knowledge from their minds, but sometimes it comes rush ing back in a black, fearful wave. “I went to a party the other night, and I was watch ing people dance,” said Ken Cantor. “All of a sudden I wondered what would be here in 80 years. I am beginning to cope with the idea of my own death," but this really hit me. Maybe no one will be dancing. Maybe no one will be here at all.”■""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For Some Children, Cure Is Only Beginning of Hospital Sojourn",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/30/archives/for-some-childern-cure-is-only-beginning-of-hospital-sojourn.html,"MARK has a wild imagination and an irresistible grin. He likes to run witches down with his imaginary car (it's important to get them before they get him). And he wants to be an Indian when he grows up.  But most of all, he wants a family. Mark, who is almost 6, has always lived in a hospital. He's never had a real visitor. Conceived out of wedlock, Mark was slated for adoption. But he was born with arthrogryposis (joints frozen in a crooked position). So the only family he has known are doctors and nurses. On the surface Mark seems a happy, well‐adjusted boy. But he apologizes a little too readily — often before he has done anything. He has to please so many adults who have varying standards that he never quite knows how to behave. Surgery has straightened his left leg to the point where he can walk (fly would be a better description) on crutches. He needs further surgery. More, he needs a loving foster family. With so few homes and so many healthy children needing them, Mark's chances aren't good. A home was ap plied for more than a year ago. Mark is still waiting. Sometimes Stay for Years Almost every hospital has someone like Mark. (The children's names have been changed at the request of the hospitals.) In fact, a general‐care city hospital often has one‐third of its pedi atric beds taken up by children who, for a variety of reasons, stay weeks, months and sometimes years longer than they should. Even voluntary hos pitals, more able to avoid cases that look like being a disposition problem, are not free of “boarder babies.”. Because a hospital bed costs about $100 a day, a needless three‐month stay for a child, in effect, wastes almost $10,000. The loss is not simply in public funds. ¶A bed is kept from a child who may really need it. ¶The boarder is exposed to disease. ¶A hospital, no matter how good, likely to produce emotional problems. Besides. Who wants to live in a hos pital? Peter doesn't. He wants to get “out of prison.” He could manage outside if there were a special group home with attendant medical care for the handicapped. But in all his 17 years, nowhere has been found for him. So he has always lived in a hospital. Recently he and Michael, 11, sat ignoring television in the lounge of Bird S. Coler Memorial Hospital on Welfare Island. Michael, who walks with the aid of heavy braces and could go home if he had a home to go to, sat waiting patiently for the Galloping Gourmet. Michael confessed shyly that he wanted to be a chef — even though he's never had the chance to make so much as a cupcake. Peter listened, then said: “You know what I want to do? I want to live.” Not all hospital boarders are handi capped. Well children spend unneces sary weeks in hospital because they have been abandoned, abused or are born of mothers who are addicted, mentally ill or otherwise incapable of caring for them. While the courts work out the disposition of the children, they wait. Shelters are so overcrowded children even have to wait to go there. Healthy but unwanted babies, mainly the result of teen‐age pregnancies, create a major problem at the District of Columbia General Hospital. So much so that Dr. Thomas Reichelderfer, chief of pediatrics, decided to make a country wide survey of the problem. He found similar situations in many other hospi tals, and he plans to submit his findings and recommendations to the Academy of Pediatrics in April. “When babies are brought in who have been picked up out of garbage cans, with dogs running around trying to eat them, you begin to think abortion is a good solution for teen‐age preg nancies,” Dr. Reichelderfer said. D. C. General, which serves a community that is 75 per cent black, has 10 to 15 unwanted babies in the hospital all the time. Dr. Reichelderfer said or phanages in the District are “chock‐a block full” and foster and adoptive homes are hard to find “because the black comunity doesn't have the where withal to support these unwanted children.” Years ago, the pediatrician con tinued, children in hospitals and or phanages “withered away and died from maternal deprivation. Today nurses and volunteers spend a lot of time playing with infants. “I'm not apologizing for what we're doing,” Dr. Reichelderfer said. “I just want a better way of doing it. It's medically unsound and frightfully ex pensive to use a hospital for essentially well children.” A current problem is the lead poison victim. A program is just getting under way to screen 120,000 ghetto children to detect lead in the system before reaches the danger level—at which produces neurological and, eventually, brain damage. Children who are admitted to a hos pital for lead poisoning from paint can not go home until the walls have been stripped or boarded over or the family relocated. Meanwhile the child waits —at $100 a day. A good hotel room would cost less. There are other apartment problems. Paul, who was admitted to Bellevue with pneumonia, could go home if his apartment had heat. In fact, he probably wouldn't have had to be admitted. David, who is in Bird S. Coler, could go home if his building had an elevator. But he can't get up five flights of stairs in a wheelchair. David's mother wants her handi capped son. But she has six other children, lives in an abandoned build ing and tries to survive on a welfare budget. So she is glad that David is “safe” in a hospital. Dr. Phoebe Saturen, head of the children's rehabilitation unit, feels that in such cases, if the hospital didn't work hard to involve the parent with the child's treatment, family ties could become so weakened that the child would end up being abandoned. “The advice that used to be given: ‘Don't take this child home,’ is, I hope, rarely given in this day and age,” Dr. Saturen commented. “Even a mentally retarded child has a right to family life and love.” Such advice was often given to the mothers of Mongoloid children. But Dr. Sanford Cohen, associate director of pediatrics at Bellevue, says such a child can help a family because he is often affectionate. More Foster Homes Needed Dr. Cohen would like more foster homes to accept them—specifically two under his care who no longer need hos pitalization. Their own families are in capable of caring for them. The abused child also presents a serious disposition problem. If the abuse causes permanent damage, it's even more difficult. Amy had been so badly beaten that she was helpless when she was admit ted to Bronx Municipal Hospital Cen ter. She was 1 year old. Eight months later she was still paralyzed and seem ingly mentally impaired, but no longer in need of acute hospital care. “We didn't quite accept the idea that she should go to a state hospital, and no one had room for her anyway,” reminisced Shirley London, chief pedi atric social worker. “So we kept her and gave her a lot of attention. We al most always have one child we do that with, although we shouldn't have to.” Amy stayed three years until a fos ter home was found. With the help of her foster mother, who is more con structive than pitying, Amy is now learning to walk with leg braces. And she has been catching up so fast in tellectually that it is hoped she will be of normal intelligence. Miss London, who is a member of the Bronx Boarder Committee, which is working hard to find homes for these children, would like to see an effort made to find more foster homes and to teach foster mothers to work with handicapped children. She would also like to see temporary quarters made available for lead poison victims and group homes established near the hospital for children who would be better off as out‐patients than in‐patients. Blythedale Children's Hospital, Val halla, N. Y., which has six children who could be released tomorrow if they had somewhere to go, is working with the Jewish Child Care Association to set up a pilot group home for the handi capped. But money is a stumbling block. Even though a group home would cost far less than hospital care, the budget of the city's Bureau of Child Welfare, which funds such homes, doesn't allow for such extras as sup portive medical services. The Edwin Gould Foundation for Children, working with various other agencies, has established a Hospital Boarder Children Committee. It has conducted surveys of the problem and is currently instituting an early detec tion system, so that each case can be dealt with promptly. It hopes eventually to find ways of expanding the number of foster and adoptive homes. Meanwhile, children like Karen, a 3‐ year‐old victim of child abuse, stay on in a hospital. Karen has some brain damage, but she is an affectionate child whose greatest need is someone to love. In the daytime there's usually someone she can wind her thin arms around and hug with all her might. But at night, when the nurses are busy with the really sick children, and Karen can't sleep, it can get pretty lonely.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Abortion Reform Beaten In the Assembly by 3 Votes,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/03/31/archives/abortion-reform-beaten-in-the-assembly-by-3-votes-vote-in-favor-of.html,"ALBANY, March 30 — The Assembly rejected tonight a bill to reform New York State's 19th‐century abortion law by a vote of 73 to 71, three votes short of the 76 required for passage. After eight hectic hours of debate the hopes of reform sponsors, buoyed by a Senate vote in favor of reform last week, were dashed for the fourth consecutive year by the 150‐member Assembly. Tensions, built up during the debate, broke in a storm of shouts and accusations from the floor when Speaker Perry B. Duryea announced he would not allow the counting of votes cast by members who had left the chamber before the roll call. Supporters of the bill chal lenged the Speaker's ruling and argued he had counted such votes “on a hundred occasions” in the past. Two such votes—from Dem ocratic Assemblymen Hulan E. Jack of Manhattan and Herbert J. Miller of Queens—were in favor of the bill. The two votes, had they been counted in the traditional man ner, would have made the final vote 75 for passage—only one shy of the necessary majority. Supporters of the bill had been told earlier by Mr. Duryea that if the reform bill won 75 votes he would provide the 76th vote himself. Normally, the Speaker votes only to break a tie. Mr. Duryea said later he had told the minority leader, Stan ley Steingut, that he had “no Intentions” of counting absen tee votes on this issue. However, both Mr. Steingut and his assistant, Assemblyman Albert H. Blumenthal, denied receiving such a statement from Mr. Duryea and said, “it would have been inconsistent with previous rulings and agree ments” of the Speaker. After the vote, Assemblyman Constance Cook, Republican of Ithaca, said she would push for reconsideration of the measure next week. Earlier, Mrs. Cook, who is one of the four women in the lower house, rallied support for the reform bill to fight back three attempts to add more re strictions. The bill before the Assembly would have permitted abortions within the first 24 weeks of pregnancy when agreed to by the prospective mother and her doctor. The Senate bill had set no time limitations. Tonight, Assemblyman Mil ler charged Mr. Duryea with “deception” and “irresponsi bility” in not counting his and Mr. Jack's votes. Mr. Mil ler said the Assembly has long‐standing precedent allow ing legislators to record votes with the clerk of the Assembly and then leave, provided they have been present for the de bate. Mr. Miller said the Speak er's action was a “subterfuge to defeat the bill.” “I submit to you,” Mrs. Cook told her colleagues, “we are not considering here today abortion on demand—we have that already. The only question is how abortions are to be had. Right now, if you have $25 you get an abortion in the back alley under the most abomin able conditions, but if you have $2,500 then you can go else where and get a proper abor tion. “I hope we, in our debate, never lose sight of that fact. We now have abortion on de mand . . . and what we are here to do is put the illegal abortionist out of business.” Rising to oppose the bill, as he did last year when reform was defeated overwhelmingly in the Assembly, Assemblyman Neil W. Kelleher, Republican of Troy, painted reform as a move to take away “the right of peo ple to exist. His face showing angry red against a dark blue shirt, Mr. Kelleher flashed pictures of un born children and charged: “Today you make the most im portant decision of your lives and their [pointing to the pic tures] lives. Your answer is to the future of literally hundreds of thousands of human lives, all of which are in your hands tonight.” The Assembly took up the measure at 3:30 today after a full week of behind‐the‐scenes maneuvering during which the Senate version (which would have given New York State the most liberal abortion law in the nation) was amended to limit abortions “on demand” to the first 24 weeks of pregnancy. After that time, an abortion could be performed only when necessary to “save the mother's life.” The chief sponsor of the As sembly bill, Mrs. Cook, ac cepted the amendment with the hope that it would pull to her side the necessary 76 votes to pass a reform bill. She and others felt confident that the amended version, if accepted, would have no trouble receiv ing Senate approval and that the end‐ result would be a Broadly reformed law. Abortion reform finally reached the cavernous chamber of the lower house today after a long, tortuous process of po litical wrangling. For three successive years, Assemblyman Blumenthatl has fought futile battles in the Assembly to reform the present law, which was originally adopted in 1829. At the begin ning of the current session, hopes for reform or repeal were equally bleak, primarily because of strong opposition by Senate Majority Leader Earl W. Brydges, Republican of Niagara Falls. Brydges Allowed Debate Mr. Brydges, however, an nounced he would allow the bill to be debated in the Sen ate. After a long, emotional de bate in that chamber, the lib eral reform bill passed by a vote of 30‐to‐26. Hopes were soaring for similar quick action in the Assembly, and sponsors counted on the Senate vote and debate on the issue to bring votes to their side. A snag developed immedi ately. Since the Senate bill and the Assembly bill were in dif ferent form, the matter had to be taken up in the Assembly Codes Committee. The chairman of that committee, Assembly man Prescott B. Huntington, is opposed to the bill, so support ers feared it would die in com mittee unless amendments were accepted. This maneuvering, however, delayed final action on the bill until today and the momentum of Senate passage was lost. During the hiatus, also, the Roman Catholic Church stepped up its traditional opposition to abortion reform and pastoral letters were issued to parishes. The State Medical Society too, joined in the protest and urged a series of amendments to control abortion practices, should the bill become law.

The Premier said that his charge was verified by the United Na tions he would accept military aid, but not troops, from any friendly foreign power. [Page 1, Column 1.] Some Administration Vietnam planners are puzzled over the build‐up in enemy in filtration into South Vietnam, which is ex pected to double or triple during April. They are not sure whether this means a new offensive because they also see signs that the Hanoi leadership may be undecided on continuing a protracted war. [7:1–5.] The conviction of First Lieut. James B. Duffy on charges of premeditated murder was revoked by the military court in Long binh, South Vietnam, that tried him. The court then convicted Lieut. Duffy of invol untary manslaughter for having allowed one of his subordinates to shoot a Vietnamese civilian. [1:2.] Japanese leftist students hijacked a Japan Air Lines jetliner with 136 persons on board and ordered the pilot to fly to North Korea, but the plane landed at Seoul, South Korea. A spokesman said that about 15 members of the Red Army, an extremist student group, were aboard. [1:3–4.] In an effort to break the job action by air controllers, the Federal Aviation Administra tion sent notices of “proposed dismissal” to absent controllers, but said that it did not plan to oust the majority of the “sick” men, only the “ringleaders.” The number of con trollers who stayed off the job continued to increase, as did the troubles of the airlines and travelers. [1:8.] An attempt by the Government to restrict demonstrations in front of the White House was severely toned down by Federal Judge George L. Hart, who struck down 15 of the 33 questions and ordered four others re worded. The original questions would have forced a would‐be picket to list his arrest, indictment, conviction and jail records and state the degree to which he advocated violence. [1:6.] According to a nationwide survey by two private organizations, about 1,500 Negroes are holding elective office in the country. Although this is a large increase, Negro offi cials make up less than 1 per cent of the nation's 500,000 elected officials. The list shows that there are 48 black mayors, 168 state legislators, 114 judges or magistrates and 99 law enforcement officials. [1:5–7.] Metropolitan The 13 Black Panthers accused of plotting to bomb public places told Supreme Court Justice John M. Murtagh that they were “ready to stand trial.” Justice Murtagh told defense attorneys that he considered that the Panther action contained an “inescapable” promise to behave themselves in court and set April 7 for resumption of the pretrial hearings. [1:5.] The publishers of the city's four major newspapers offered 10 unions representing 13,000 employes a 16.5 per cent wage increase over three years. The unions were critical of the proposal and met to discuss their next step. The contracts between the newspapers and the unions expired at mid night. [1:7.] The Assembly turned back a bill that would have liberalized the state's 19th‐ cen tury abortion law. Supporters of the bill mustered 73 votes to the 71 cast against it, three short of the 76 needed. A protest broke out over the Speaker's decision not to tabu late absentee ballots. [1:16‐7.] On the eve of the Democratic State Com mittee meeting to endorse a statewide ticket, tensions within the party began to surface. Robert M. Morganthau charged that Meade H. Esposito, the party leader in Brooklyn, had helped a “crime‐dominated union.” Nas sau County Executive Eugene H. Nickerson said he might not support Arthur J. Goldberg if Mr. Goldberg was nominated, and Mario A. Procaccino said he might oppose any “Liberal‐left” candidate. [1:3.4.] Representative Richard L. Ottinger, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for Senate, chaired hearings by a House sub committee into the crisis in telephone service and drew an answer from a Public Service Commission official that he “assumed” that the camim ission did not have the authority to withhold the recent $136.7‐million telephone rate increase because of poor service.

The plane had been hijacked by the radical students, armed with swords, bombs and pistols, on Monday. The students ignored pleas that they release the 115 other persons still on board. [Page 1, Cols. 2–5.] Military equipment originally valued at $3.4‐billion has been turned over to allied governments in the last 19 years, the State Department disclosed, but the department disputed Congressional complaints about secrecy, saying that full details of the trans actions were given routinely to the Con gressional military committees. [1:3–4.] A military court in South Vietnam has sentenced First Lieut. James B. Duffy to six months in confinement. The courtmartial originally found Lieutenant Duffy guilty of premeditated murder, which carries mandatory life sentence, for his part in the death of a Vietnamese civilian, but later changed its verdict to guilty of involuntary manslaughter. [1:1.1 The United States military command in Saigon reported that a North Vietnamese MIG‐21 had been shot down by an American jet fighter over North Vietnam. The Amer ican plane was said to be on an escort mis sion for a reconnaissance plane. [1:3–4.] Guatemalan terrorists kidnapped the West German Ambassador to Guatemala, Count Karl von Spreti, in the latest in a series of political seizures. An American diplomat and the Guatemalan Foreign Minister were ab ducted earlier. [1:2–3.] National The Supreme Court held without dissent that trial judges have the right to bind and gag, jail for contempt or expel from court a disruptive defendant. The ruling, which in cluded a strong denunciation of court dis ruptions, said that a disorderly defendant may forfeit his constitutional right to be present in court. [1:8.1.] An “unconditional” 12 per cent wage offer was made to the postal unions by the Gov ernment. Half the increase would be retro active to Oct. 1, 1969, and the other half would become effective July 1. The unconditional feature meant that the Nixon Ad ministration was no longer insisting that the workers back its Post Office reorganization plan. [1:2.] F. Lee Bailey, the executive director of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organi zation, announced that he was urging the controllers to end their “sick‐out.” However, it was not clear whether the men would re turn to work. [1:1.] Senators George D. Aiken and John J. Williams, both influential Republicans, an nounced that they would support the nomi nation of Judge G. Harrold Carswell to the Supreme Court. The announcements were expected to help the pro‐confirmation forces. [1:7.] Metropolitan Rent control was extended for three more years by the City Council, but sentiment for modification of the statute was evident in the debate. Mayor Lindsay has said he would propose modification by June 1, but many Councilmen doubted that he would and urged that they take the lead. [1:6.] After a strongly partisan debate, the Leg islature passed a $2.2‐billion aid‐to‐education bill. The amount is an increase of $388‐mil lion over that in the present budget—an increase that in effect repeals the economies approved last year. [1:5.] Deputy Mayor Robert M.

Abortion Reform Now,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/01/archives/abortion-reform-now.html,"The good faith of the Republican leadership in the State Legislature is at test in the battle over abortion reform, an idea whose time not only has come but is long overdue. The manner in which a strong reform bill was maneuvered into defeat in the Assembly this week after its surprise passage in the Senate raises questions about the sincerity of the G.O.P. high command in Albany.  Doubts that the leadership intended to provide a fair field of combat for any reform measure were stirred two weeks ago when the Senate Majority Leader, Earl W. Brydges, gave the signal for com mittee clearance of an ultra‐liberal bill after malty years of blocking a Senate vote on any proposal to modify or repeal the archaic law now on the books. Despite a Brydges announcement that he intended to vote against the committee proposal—usually enough in itself to kill any bill—the Senate responded to strong popular and judicial pressure by voting to make abortion a personal‐ matter for decision by a woman and her physician. Much easier passage was anticipated in the Assem bly, where reform sentiment always has been more assertive. The big problem there was not mustering a mere majority of those voting but the absolute majority of total Assembly membership necessary for passage. Speaker Perry B. Duryea assured the bill's supporters that, if it came within a single vote of the 76 required, he would supply the extra vote himself. When it came time for the actual tally, however, the Speaker declined to follow tradition by counting the votes of two backers of the‐bill who had left the chamber before the roll‐call. That omission made the final count 73‐to‐71 in favor of reform; the bill thus lost by not gaining the necessary 76 votes even though it won. This result cannot be allowed to stand. The present Iaw has doomed countless women to needless pain and anguish. It has permitted illegal abortions to prosper under conditions degrading to any civilized society; it discriminates cruelly against the poor; in the light of recent court decisions, it is extremely dubious that it is even legal. The ultimate tragedy would be to learn that so many have been condemned to illegal operations in the name of an illegal law. While respecting the deep reserve held by many ton grounds both of faith and morality, we believe that the Assembly's obligation is to pass the bill that already has received a floor majority.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Liberal Plan Approved,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/01/archives/liberal-plan-approved-maryland-votes-abortion-reform.html,"ANNAPOLIS, Md., March 31 —The General Assembly ap proved today a bill that would make Maryland's abortion law the most liberal in the nation.  The bill would repeal an abor tion law adopted in 1968. It would thus leave completely up to a woman and her doctor the questions of when and whether a pregnancy should be termi nated. The measure was enacted when the House of Delegates concurred by a 78‐to‐43 vote on amendments adopted last night in the Senate, which passed the legislation 23 to 18. There were indications, how ever, that aides to Gov. Marvin Mandel, Democrat, were at tempting to switch enough votes to gain reconsideration and defeat of the bill. Although the Governor's office denied any such move, an aide privately acknowledged that Mr. Mandel did not want a new abortion law. It was felt that he was hesitant to sign such an act in an election year. The Governor has a policy of awaiting legal review of all newly enacted statues before signing them. If signed, the abortion bill would take effect July 1. The law that would be re pealed is itself considered lib eral. Under it a doctor can le gally terminate a pregnancy if the prospective mother's physi cal or mental health is im paired, or if the pregnancy re sulted from rape. The new bill would permit a licensed doctor to perform a legal abortion in any licensed hospital in the state. There would be no residency require ments for women who sought abortions. That is the main dif ference between the bill and the one that recently became law in Hawaii. The Hawaiian bill has a residency require ment of 90 days. The Maryland vote crossed both religious nad political lines. One of the accepted amend ments, offered by Senator J. Joseph Curran Jr., Democrat of Baltimore, would permit Mary land doctors and hospitals to refuse to perform an abortion if desired. Many opponents of the new bill argued that it would make Maryland the abortion capital of the nation. But Delegate Aris Allen, the House Republican leader, a physician, argued that repeal of the 1968 law would allow hospital review boards close scrutiny of pro posed abortions. The most serious threat to enactment came on a motion in the Senate that would have suspended the rules and per mitted introduction of a series of amendments that, in effect, would have retained the old law. The motion failed by 23 to 20. During the debate, Senator Margaret Schweinhaut, Demo crat, told her associates, “It is curious to me that you gentle men can speak so freely about something you know so little about.” “We are dealing here with human life,” she said. “We have no right to say there should be no restrictions on the taking of that life. What is be ing suggested here is that we put the life of an unborn child in the hands of the medical profession.” Michigan Test Nears Special to The New York Times DETROIT, March 31—Michi gan's abortion law headed to day toward a test of its con stitutionality after a district judge ruled it unenforceable because of vagueness. Arnold Shifman, chief assist ant prosecutor, said that he would appeal to the Oakland County Circuit Court the ad verse decision yesterday by Southfield District Judge Clar ence A. Reid Jr. Ultimately, the State Supreme Court would have the last word on the ques tion of constitutionality. Judge Reid, after a 10‐min ute pretrial examination hear ing, dismissed charges against Dr. Jesse Ketchum and his wife, Judith. The Ketchums were charged Jan. 5 with conspiracy to com mit an illegal abortion. An undercover state policewoman said she had arranged for an abortion and paid the doctor $500. Judge Reid focused on lan guage in the Michigan law that permits a physician to termi nate a pregnancy only when “necessary to preserve life.” The judge found this standard so vague as to deny the ac cused due process of law un der the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution. The same words were cited by the California Supreme Court in holding that state's anti‐abortion law unconstitu tional, a 4‐to‐3 decision that the United States Supreme Court refused to review last month. The Michigan Senate is ex pected in a few weeks to ap prove legislation leaving the question of abortion in the ear ly months of pregnancy to the woman and her physician. Gov. William G. Milliken, a Repub lican, is supporting the bill, with minor reservations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
New Vote Due Next Week,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/01/archives/new-vote-due-next-week-revote-on-abortion-bill-due-in-albany.html,"ALBANY, March 31—Re fusing to accept defeat, spon sors of the bill that would lib eralize the state's abortion law, which failed in the Assembly yesterday, are keeping the bill alive and hope for another vote next week.  Mrs. Constance E. Cook, a Republican member of the As sembly from Ithaca, saved the bill by a parliamentary maneu ver during the hectic midnight roll‐call when the 73‐to‐70 vote left it three short of the 76 needed for passage. Mrs. Cook's maneuver res cued the bill by placing it on the table—parliamentary jar gon for a move that, in effect, erased the unfavoarble vote and placed the bill in limbo. It can he called up for a vote at any time within 24 hours notice. Mrs. Cook said today that she made the move with approval from Assembly Speak er Perry B. Duryea Jr., Repub lican of Montauk, and planned now to ask for reconsideration next Wednesday. “And,” Mrs. Cook said con fidently, “it will pass.” The optimism of Mrs. Cook and other supports of changes in the abortion law stems from the fact that three Assemblymen favoring the bill were absent when the vote was counted. One Assemblyman was ill and could not attend, but the other two—Hulan E. Jack of Manhattjn and Herbert L. Miller of Queens, both Demo crats—had asked that their votes be recorded for the bill even though they were absent, a common legislative practice. Speaker Duryea, however, pressed to rule on whether to count such absentee votes, found himself caught in a poli tical dilemma. Those opposing the bill were primarily Repub licans—the very votes on which Mr. Duryea must count to pass partisan and administrative bills. On the other hand, those favoring the bill were largely Democrats who fight the leadership at every turn. Although Mr. Duryea person ally favors the bill and had promised to cast the 76th vote if necessary to pass it, he ruled in favor of the predominantly Republican opponents. Had those two votes been recorded, Mr. Duryea's prom ised 76th vote would have passed the bill to reform the state's 19th‐century abortion law, which allows abortions only to save the woman's life. The bill under consideration would allow abortions for any reason before the 24th week of pregnancy when agreed to by the woman and her doctor. After the 24th week, an abor tion could be performed only in an emergency. It would be one of the most liberal reform laws in the nation. An even more liberal version, coontaining no restrictions, passed the Senate earlier, but that body is expected to go along with the Assembly ver sion should it pass in that chamber. When Mr. Duryea was asked about his ruling disallowing the two votes, he told news men: “On some issues if a man wants to leave the room and stay around that's one thing. I don't know where these men [Mr. Jack and Mr. Miller] are.” He was asked if he had set that requirement on other oc casions. “I can't tell you what went on in every roll call,” he re plied. Though the members are aware that a strict interpreta tion of the rules require mem bers be in their seats to be recorded, it has been custom ary for the leadership to take absentee votes. This normally lax interpre tation of the rules has con sistently been cited as the reason that an expensive elec tric roll‐call machine is never used—it cannot record the vote of an absent member. Today Mr. Duryea issued a brief excerpt from the official record of yesterday's session in which he is quoted as saying, just before the opening debate on the abortion bill: “Once the roll call is com menced on this bill, no mem ber will be allowed to leave the chamber until the roll call is completed.” An aide to the Speaker said, “It was on the basis of that statement that he ruled as he did.” Both Mr. Miller and Mr. Jack were incensed. Mr. Miller, who called from a roadside tele phone on his way to his home, to register a protest, said he had left the chamber early be cause of trouble with his car. “I wouldn't have left if the clerk hadn't assurred me that it was all right,” Mr. Miller said. Mr. Jack said urgent busi ness had taken him away and added: “I'll be in the chamber when the next vote is taken.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Students Elect Radical at Texas U.,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/03/archives/students-elect-radical-at-texas-u.html,"AUSTIN, Tex., April 2—A 25‐year‐old bearded, radical activist from Brentwood, L.I., was elected today as presi dent of the students associa tion of the University of Texas.

Four other students on the “Yin‐Yang” ticket were elect ed to the 33‐member student assembly.

Yin and Yang, in Chinese philosophy, are thought to be opposing but complementary life forces whose interactions influence destiny. Asked to explain the name of his party, Mr. Jones said, “We just de cided to tack ‘conspiracy’ at the end of it.” The New Yorker credited his victory to his endorse ment of the abolition of the grading system and foreign language requirements, pro viding abortion and birth con trol information at the Student Health Center, and establishing a $2.50 an hour minimum wage for university personnel.

New York,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/05/archives/new-york-abortion-reform-how-victory-was-turned-into-defeat.html,"ALBANY—The cathedral‐like light of sunshine through the stained‐glass windows of the cavernous Assembly chamber gave way to gloomy darkness as the debate dragged toward midnight and suspicions began to overwhelm reason.  It is the beginning of eutha nasia, conservatives shouted— the easy death. First we provide death for the unborn child. Next it will be the incurably sick. And then the mentally ill. And then the aged. And then—who knows? On the other side, reformers whispered: The bishop said pub lic prayers for the soul of a member voting for reform and now that member's vote has been changed. It was Monday night; the debate on the New York abortion‐reform bill had reached the showdown stage. Abortion reform has been sweeping the country since Colo rado liberalized its laws in 1967. Since then, 10 other states have liberalized 19th‐century laws that forbid the aborting of an unwanted child except in ex treme cases. The General As sembly in Maryland last week approved a bill that would make that state's abortion law the most liberal in the nation. It would leave completely up to a woman and her doctor the ques tions of when and whether a pregnancy should be terminated. Killed Twice Before Spurred on by hopes of mi nority groups that legalized abor tions would reduce the grim sta tistics of death at the hands of illegal abortionists; the increased militancy of women who believe abortion to be their decision alone; and court questioning of such laws, abortion reform had reached the Assembly of the State of New York. It had been here before, twice for full‐dress debate, but had been killed. Even before Assembly Speaker Perry B. Duryea showed an un accustomed allegiance to the rules of the Assembly and re fused to count the votes of ab sentee members (votes tradition ally counted and which could have passed the bill) it was clear to observers that abortion re form was in trouble. Advocates sensed early in the day that the optimism generated by the un precedented Senate vote in favor of reform only a week before had been washed away. The Senate had, with rare dig nity, debated and then passed a bill to replace the present law (allowing abortion only to save a mother's life) with one permit ting abortions at anytime a pro spective mother and her physi cian agreed it should be done. What had happened between that day, March 18, and this, March 30, reformists asked? The answers are not as suspicious and conspiratorial as some sug gest. The most important difference is that anti‐reformists were at first caught off guard. When the bill came up in the Senate there was little concern on the part of traditional opponents like the Catholic Church and the state medical society. After all, the bill had never been debated in the Senate because the power of that body—Majority Leader Earl W. Brydges a Niagara Falls Re publican—was opposed to re form and his word could be law on almost any issue. As it hap pened, he had decided this year to let the bill rise or fall on its merits—and it passed. The next steps were crucial in the tortuous road toward abor tion reform. Assembly sponsors failed to push for immediate As sembly consideration and take advantage of the momentum built up by the Senate vote. In stead, they allowed the bill to go into the Assembly Codes Com mittee, whose chairman opposed reform. While it languished there the opposition had time to mobilize. Easter religious celebrations came and the Catholic bishops filled parishioners with their op position in the form of pastoral letters—read in all Catholic churches—opposing reform, con demning it as murder. The state medical society, hoping to keep a measure of control over the eventual abortion practice should the bill become law, en tered objections. Meanwhile, opponents in com mittee insisted on amendments limiting abortions on demand to the first 24 weeks of pregnancy and only to save the mother's life thereafter. Two Main Effects In the end, the hiatus had two important effects: (1) It allowed the opposition time to mount a campaign, in cluding a demonstration on the Capitol steps encouraged by the Bishop of Albany. (2) The amendments changed a “clean” bill—which forced Senate debaters to face the issue of freedom or state interference in the question of abortions squarely—and directed later As sembly debate to endless ques tions of when life begins in the womb and when a safe abortion can occur Finally, the Assembly reacted as it did because its members are elected from smaller districts than are the state senators and the pressure of any organized lobby is magnified. Perhaps the key indication of this is the Catholic vote in the assembly: Of 62 Catholics in that chamber, 49 voted against reform. Other votes against reform reflected a strong Catholic pressure on non Catholic members. In the face of all these ob stacles of political reality and tactical errors it is probably more amazing that the bill would have passed anyway had it not been for Mr. Duryea's ruling that blocked the absentee votes. There were 73 votes in favor— only three short of the 76 need ed for passage. Two absentees had voted for passage, bringing the total to 75. And Mr. Duryea had promised sponsors he would, if necessary, provide the 76th vote to pass the bill. It is on that promise, and the promise that all supporters will stay in their seats next time, that reformers pin their hopes that a bill “whose time has come” will eventually become law this year. Refusing to ac cept defeat, sponsors of the bill in the Assembly kept it alive with a parliamentary maneuver and announced that they will try to get another vote this week. Lindsay's Day There is an old tradition at the University of California at Berkeley. Every year on the uni versity's Charter Day, April 2, a prominent national figure is in vited to the campus to (1) re ceive an honorary degree, and (2) make a major address. This year, the tradition took a new twist. When California Gov. Ronald Reagan and the conserv ative university regents learned that the invited speaker was to be New York's liberal Mayor John Lindsay, they voted not to award him the usual honorary degree. So last Tuesday, the un‐hon ored Mayor arrived at Berkeley and delivered a Charter Day speech which brought cheers from liberal students and frowns from the regents. Mr. Lindsay attacked President Nixon and his Administration for “replac ing moral imperatives” with a “Southern strategy,” and with having proposed legislation that “constitutes the most signifi cant threat to freedom from our Government in a generation.” And he told the students they “can stand as an alternative ... as a warning system to men and organizations which are not helping to make this country what it be.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ABORTION CLINICS IN BRITAIN WARNED,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/05/archives/abortion-clinics-in-britain-warned.html,"LONDON, April 4 (AP)—The Government has warned Brit ain's private abortion clinics, in which 20,686 women had legal abortions last year, to stop soliciting foreign patients.  Health Minister Richard Crossman demanded in letters sent yesterday to the 54 nurs ing homes licensed to perform abortions that they guarantee that patients be given a thor ough medical examination and post‐operation treatment. The licenses are due for renewal April 26. The move followed demands by Members of Parliament to tighten Britain's 1967 abortion law, which allows any woman to have a pregnancy terminated with the written permission of two doctors. Critics complained that some doctors authorized abortions without full medical examinations and discharged patients a few hours after the anesthetic wore off. Last year, 54,013 legal abor tions were performed in Britain. In the last three months of 1969, 615 women came from the United States alone to get rid of unwanted babies. A fur ther total of 508 came from West Germany",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/05/archives/letters-letters.html,"LIFE. LIB AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS To THE EDITOR: Like Susan Brownmiller (“Sisterhood Is Powerful,” March 15), I am single and a freelance writer, and, like many other women, I have had my share of upsets and complications in trying to understand and to get along with the opposite sex. Perhaps never having had an abortion, I am behind the pack and have not “experience” enough to judge the depths of resent ment that Miss Brownmiller and others in the movement seem to share. I suspect, how ever, that for many of them the chief grudge they bear is a record of disappointments, and that what they might hope to gain in their earnest avowal of women's rights, equality forever and other commend able goals is faulted by a negative, humorless approach that seems directed at relieving their gripes. I only wish to point out to the most violent members of these groups that they do not, and can not, speak for me. I am not oppressed—no more, I doubt, than are many men—and I resent their carry ing the banner over my head. Alas, for their fixation on sex ual problems, their generally anxious manner, I do not feel entirely sympathetic. They may fight the good fight for real issues — abortion reform, day ‐ care centers, equal ‐ em ployment opportunities, etc.— and I will join them. But I reserve the right to be skepti cal. (In their rush to fame, some women are being paid— by men—to write books. These women have no competence at all, except for their ability to take advantage of the unfor tunate fear certain ments of the American popu lation, chiefly publishers, of missing out on the latest thing.) Where are the women who are campaigning for office, since, traditionally, power is in the hands of representatives elected by the public at large? How many women in the past have let the moral responsi bility of running the world fall to others because they don't wish, sensibly, to give the money, guts, energy and courage it takes to perform these thankless tasks? How many women really are will ing to give up their cushions to go out and work for the human race, not just this mythical female “class” so designated by the radicals among them? I resent their campaign be cause it is unbalanced, and, finally, I believe, false. Do they really want to give up the privilege of bearing children, or struggling to build harmonious relationships with men (who ever said it wasn't a struggle?). What about the power of grace, charm, sub tlety, difference? I do not wish to deny the male his pride, or, heaven help him, where would he be? I do not wish to spend my life a bitter harridan try ing to excuse those offenses to my person when I might better be coaxing more posi tive hopes. Recall the words of Coco Chanel, about how a woman is foolish to talk so much about equality with men, since in most cases it is a step down? ANN GERACIMOS. New York. • To THE EDITOR: Just as women have fled the male‐dominated left to form their own movement to end their oppression, homo sexual women are organizing to combat oppression at the hands of their straight sisters. “Women as a class have never subjugated another group. ... We want to be neither op pressor or oppressed ...” says Susan Brownmiller. We will bypass the issue of child oppression and refer back only a few paragraphs in this same article, where the writer quips about the “laven der menace.” Men used to and still do dismiss women's urgent de mands for an end to their pain and unjust treatment in just such demeaning and friv olous phrases. The few “mili tant lesbians” Miss Brownmil ler refers to are women with the incredible courage to ac knowledge their sexual pref erence and to speak up for their human rights. Women who have not thoroughly ex amined the effects of the male‐heterosexual supremacist culture on their own attitudes and psyches have not recog nized their own scapegoats and analyzed the implications. They bravely talk about lib erating themselves from de humanizing genital‐role defi nitions, but then employ the same odious treatment in deal ing with women who have found a sexual, emotional and spiritual companion in another woman. This constitutes a basic contradiction within wo men's liberation, and, unless it is dealt with, will defeat our movement and our high est aspirations. Susan Brownmiller says wo men's revolution is the final revolution. I have a deep faith in and commitment to revolution that frees us from imposed and demeaning defi nitions. I believe this to be the key to human liberation in the fullest sense of the word. But if women's libera tion as it currently defines itself succeeds, will there be “rehabilitation camps” for homosexuals in their new world as there are for “loose women” and homosexuals now in Cuba? Will the love of a woman for a woman be con sidered a disgusting, depraved, sick relationship? Where then is the equality and freedom for women that is the aim of the movement? Women may get equal pay, day‐care centers, the right to abort, equal education—but as long as a woman's essential definition remains tied to whom she is permitted to have genital relations with, there will be no revolution—only privileges gained within an oppressive psycho‐social sys tem. The last revolution will have to be for all of us. LOIS HART. Gay Liberation Front. New York. MINI, MIDI, TEKEL, UPHARSIN To THE EDITOR: The picture is clear for women (“Good‐by, Knees,” by Patricia Peterson, March 8) It isn't that you don't like the midi, that you think it a ghastly style, but that you're “timid” if you refuse to accept it. If ever the case was clear of fashion editors fronting for the industry, this is it—not reporting the fashion news but subtly pushing the weak, mindless mass of women into feeling that they “have to have” the latest style. Anyone for looking as frumpy as Madame Pompidou on her recent visit to our shores? Who wants to look like a maiden aunt from the provinces? What has happened to our emancipation, ladies — the emancipation promulgated by our youth: do your own thing? Paris decrees. Are we really so dependent on a former world power that our own American designers, many of whom stated publicly that they didn't like the midi, are being forced to knuckle under to the pressure of the fashion world, the manufacturers, stores and boutiques? We are being sold on dumping our wardrobes for the “new” length (shades of the awful postwar Dior era). Are we really in for another siege of French ‐ inspired fashion lu nacy? In a time of galloping infla tion, of vast poverty in the world, women are being conned into jettisoning their entire wardrobes and starting all over again with the “warmed‐over” late nineteen‐ forties. Don't be “timid,” ladies. Out with the skirt length your husbands, boy friends and the girl‐watchers like. Be “in style”—look like the good old Girl Scout lead ers used to look before they were emancipated by clothes useful for the pace of today's living. If it is true that your ward robe will look “warmed over” next year, be smart. Don't buy that new spring suit or any summer clothes at all. Wear what you have. Then you will only have to throw away your “old” clothes. I don't know about anybody else, but I resent the deliber ate manipulation and the pres sure to conform. LUCILE NATHANSON. New York. Mrs. Peterson replies: “The news facts are clear. The longer skirt was shown inter nationally by many leading designers. Fall designs prom ise even more. “Controversy follows close on the heels of any strong suggested silhouette change. Remember the piercing squeals of ‘indecent’ and ‘shocking’ over the first minis? “The choice of skirt length is still yours. In a sea of on coming midis, do your own thing. Be a standout. Be a holdout in a mini. History may make this the independent decade in which women won't follow fashion, but time will tell. Until then, relax. It's a long, hot summer ahead.” OIL AND VINEGAR To THE EDITOR: Your March 8 issue carried an article by Erwin Knoll at tacking the so‐called “oil lob by” (“The Oil Lobby Is Not Depleted”). It would take a reply fully as long as the orig inal to do justice to the super ficialities, misrepresentations and artful omissions in the article. However, I would like to cite a few examples: 1. A great deal is made of the alleged $5‐billion “cost” of the oil import program to the public, but nowhere is it indicated that this is a matter very much in dispute. The United States Department of the Interior, for example, es timates that the real cost of the program—after taking all factors into account—is only about one‐fifth the figure cited by Mr. Knoll, and points out that such a cost represents very inexpensive insurance for the military and economic se curity provided by the pro gram. 2. Along the same lines, the article quotes at length from hostile testimony at last year's hearings on the im port program. No mention whatever is made of the tell ing points made by many prominent witnesses at the same hearings in support of the program. As far as the reader could tell, there was no “other side” to the case. 3. Ironically, some of the Senators and Congressmen who are most vocal in con demning controls over oil im ports are outspoken advocates of import restrictions on other commodities that are manu factured in their states. Thus, some argue forcefully, for ex ample, for controls over dairy imports, while others favor tight import restrictions on shoes and textiles. Apparent ly, however, Mr. Knoll sees nothing inconsistent in this. 4. The article gives a dis torted impression of a tele gram sent to the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee to the staff of the Cabinet Task Force on Oil Import Control. The key part of the telegram, as reported in the press, was: “If, at the same time Congress is reducing de pletion allowances, it develops that imports of oil are in creased, the combination of the two could be injurious to the development of further re serves in the U.S.” Moreover, Mr. Knoll suggests that this telegram was an example of “pressure” on the task force; in fact, it was sent in response to an inquiry from the task force staff. 5. Mr. Knoll quotes liberal ly the arguments and statistics cited by opponents of import controls. But he ignores the fact that submissions to the Task Force by several of the Government departments and agencies most directly con cerned contained impressive statistical support for the pro gram. So did a letter sent to the President by 81 members of the House of Representa tives, including the majority leader and the chairmen of eight committees, who op posed weakening the program on the ground that such action would jeopardize national se curity. 6. The author quotes fig ures from the First National City Bank of New York to try to build a case that oil profits are excessive, as com pared with those of other in dustries. Ironically, the very same bank tabulation shows that the petroleum industry's rate of return on net worth— the true measure of profits— was 12.9 per cent in 1968, compared with an all‐manu facturing average of 13.1 per cent. In fact, as far back as these statistics have been maintained by the bank, the petroleum industry's return on its investment has run slightly below the average for all manufacturing. (Incidentally, a reproduction of an oil in dustry advertisement accom panying the article was con veniently cropped one line above the place where this comparison of profits would have been shown.) 7. The article quotes a Con gressional source to the effect that the American Petroleum Institute “has been a pace and‐precedent‐setter ... vig orously seeeking to adapt its positions and attitudes to the wave of the future.” We like ... to think this is true and is reflected in such actions as the allocation of more than $3,000,000 annually in insti tute funds to air and water pollution research. A.P.I.'s research program includes dozens of scientific projects at universities and research lab oratories, with Government agencies participating in many of them. This being the case, we deeply resent the innuendo that there is something spuri ous about the program, espe cially since the author made no effort whatever to get the facts, which are readily avail able. FRANK N. IKARD. President, American Petroleum Institute. New York. Mr. Knoll replies: “Mr. Ik ard's principal complaint about my article seems to be that it did not do what Mr. Ikard does so well—advance the oil industry's special pleading in behalf of its egregious privi leges. In view of the Ameri can Petroleum Institute's pro digious efforts, I think Mr. Ikard is being unduly modest when he refers to ‘the so called “oil lobby.”’ Would he have readers believe that the lobby is a figment of my imagination? “As for the specific points raised in Mr. Ikard's letter: “The recently released re port of President Nixon's task force on oil ‐ import controls declared: ‘In 1969, consumers paid about $5‐billion more for oil products than they would have paid in the absence of restrictions. By 1980, the an nual cost to consumers would approximate $8.4‐billion.’ The Office of Emergency Preparedness, which has been given primary responsibility for co ordinating the President's new Oil Policy Committee, esti mated the 1969 cost of the quota system at $5.25‐billion. “It was the unanimous find ing of the President's task force that ‘the present import control program is not ade quately responsive to present and future security considera tions.’ In testimony before a House subcommittee on March 9, Assistant Secretary of De fense Barry J. Shillito said: ‘We firmly believe that oil import controls can be gradu ally relaxed to permit in creased oil imports, within the limits planned, without ad versely affecting national se curity.’ “The ‘hostile testimony’ I quoted represented the expert judgment of independent economists. One of the indus try's conceits is that only those persons who are on the payroll of an oil company or trade association are qualified to talk about oil issues. The ‘many prominent witnesses’ Mr. Ikard cites in support of the import program were, with very few exceptions, in dustry spokesmen. “Mr. Ikard slides over the significant — and costly — dif ference between oil quotas and import tariffs. He is quite right about the inconsistent position of some legislators who oppose oil import con trols but support other trade restrictions. This is a fine de bating point for the oil lobby ists, but I fail to see how it strengthens the case for oil quotas. “As I reported, the chair man of the most powerful leg islative committee in the House warned the task‐force staff against ‘tinkering with the matter of oil imports.’ Mr. Ikard is entitled to his judgment that this did not constitute pressure. “My article made clear that the oil industry has devoted supporters within the execu tive and legislative branches of the Federal Government. The submissions to which Mr. Ikard refers were analyzed— and rejected— by staff ex perts and a majority of the members of the President's task force. The 81 Congress men who expressed their sup port for the quota system were, without exception, rep resentatives of oil ‐ producing areas. “The profit figures I cited were based on net sales. The ‘true measure’ preferred by Mr. Ikard — return on net worth—is peculiarly mislead ing when applied to the oil industry, since it obscures the important factor of cash flow, which includes not only net income but depletion and de preciation reserves. Thus, in 1968 the cash flow of oil com panies totaled $9.6 ‐ billion, consisting of $5.8‐billion in net income after taxes and $3.8‐billion in depletion and depreciation reserves. This is equal to the assets of more than 60 per cent of all manu facturing corporations. “It is gratifying to learn that the industry is allocating a few million dollars for re search to counteract its many billions of dollars' worth of pollution and environmental damage. I wish Mr. Ikard were as forthcoming on other, unpublicized aspects of the American Petroleum Institute's budget. “Mr. Ikard chooses not to address himself to the central theme of my article—the per vasive and pernicious influ ence of oil in politics. He seems content to let my con clusions on this point stand, and so am I.” PICTURE CREDITS 1—OLIVE PIERCE 25—CLEMENS KALISCHER 30–31—HARRIS 8 EWING; THE NEW YORK TIMES (ERNEST SISTO): UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL 32–33—RAY GREEN FROM TRANSWORLD FEATURES 39—THE NEW YORK TIMES (JACK MANNJNG) 44–56—MIKE SMITH 64—ROMANO CAGN ON 76—NASA 82—DRAWINGS BY RALPH J.

FEMINIST EFFORT GROWS IN CROTON,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/05/archives/feminist-effort-grows-in-croton-movement-born-in-the-cities.html,"CROTON‐ON‐HUDSON, N.Y., April 4—The women's libera tion movement, born on the campuses and in the cities and nurtured on the energy of rad ical politics, has come to this village on the Hudson.  It came quietly, almost timid ly—a few friends meeting in an afternoon to share ideas. But within two months, membership in the Croton Women's Libera tion Organization has grown to over 50. The group has demonstrated in New York City against abor tion laws, sent a telegram with 50 signatures to Albany urging repeal of abortion laws, and is now planning a boycott of su permarkets that stock products whose advertising pitch is in sulting to women. Countless women's liberation groups have been over this ter ritory before, and in the per spective of bra burning and karate lessons, such an agenda sounds almost tame. But Croton is not New York or Boston. It is a village of 7,000 people, with steep hills, panoramic views, and a main street that looks like a set for a movie about small‐town America. Most Over 30 And the women who gathered in Mrs. Joyce Lippmann's living room on Young Avenue on a recent Saturday were not post graduate radicals. Nearly every one was over 30; almost all were married and the mothers of two or more children. As they spoke, they kept care fully away from the rhetoric, that has become part of the movement—phrases such as “consciousness raising” and “rap sessions.” “We're not here for amateur psycho‐analysis,” Mrs. Frances Lazare, said im patiently when someone ex plained the theory of conscious ness raising to her. So if the Croton Women's Liberation Organization has not broken any new ground, it is interesting for what it is—a group of settled, financially se cure suburban housewives who have rather suddenly come to feel that the movement they have been disinterestingly read ing about for several years is also addressed to them. No one knows the extent to which women's liberation has made inroads into suburbia. There may be many groups like the one in Croton, but because they are not affiliated with any national organizations, they are impossible to trace. Or the Cro ton group may be one of the first. There were no suburban groups represented among the 50 organizations that partici pated in the Congress to Unite Women, a convention of libera tion groups that met in New York last fall. Started by Teacher The Croton group was organ ized by Mrs. Littman, a 28‐ year‐old history teacher whose husband, Henry, is an I.B.M. computer engineer. Mrs. Lippmann who had been active in New Democratic Coalition politics, said she started reading about women's liberation last summer and felt that suburbia was “fertile ter ritory if it's approached right.” “There's a lot of restlessness here,” she said. “It's a feeling that this is not where it's hap pening.” Restlessness, isolation, and boredom were cited by many of the women at the meeting in Mrs. Lippmann's home as reasons for their initial interest in the movement. The distance to New York City—where many of their husbands commute— makes the problem worse. “I'm away from my husband so many hours of the day,” said Mrs. Jodi Rucquois, whose husband, James, works in tele vision advertising in New York. “I had to take a part time job because I knew if I sat in this lovely little dump on the Hud son all day. I'd go bananas. The rounds trip fare to the city is $3.50, and unless you're a superwoman, you can't get in and do anything and get back by 3:30, when the kids get out of school.” No Super to Call But the isolation, the women said, also leads to a greater in dependence. A woman has to take more responsibility for running a house than she does in a city apartment, where the first reaction in a daytime crisis can be to call the build ing's super. “This is what makes us in terested in women's libera tion,” said Mrs. Elaine Disick, a dark‐haired mother of two who is part owner of a hippie shop in Ossining. “We are less dependent on men than city women are. There is more lone liness and isolation here, but also more of a sense of self.” Mrs. Disick, who says she moved from Manhattan five years ago because her husband, David's, “vision” included a wife and children in the sub urbs, offered an explanation for the Croton women's gen eral reluctance to talk about their personal problems—a fea ture of many city women's lib eration meetings. “People in the suburbs have to he more cautious about re vealing too much of them selves to their neighbors,” she said. “It's not like in the city where you come together for one purpose and then don't see each other again. Here, you are stuck with the same people all the time. You'll have to relate to them ober and over again.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For Women Seminarians, Good Works, Not a Pulpit, Is the Goal",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/06/archives/for-women-seminarians-good-works-not-a-pulpit-is-the-goal.html,"THEY cringe at the thought of having the title Reverend tacked before their names. They wear miniskirts, march in protest parades, and work in the ghettos. If somebody says “God is Dead” to them, they're apt to argue for hours. If anyone is dying, they say, it's the woman seminarian whose only goal is to preach from the pulpit. The trend among many women theol ogy students in the New York area is away from ordination and the parish ministry to which it leads and into new forms of the Protestant ministry. These include team ministry work, jobs as hos pital chaplains and Young Women's Christian Association workers, and in religious publishing, counseling and teaching. But this liberal orientation is confined mainly to big city seminaries, theology educators say. The traditional approach to religion is still found in the country's fundamentalist seminaries, many of which are in mid‐America. One reason some women shun ordi nation is simply because they are dis criminated against. Several denomina tions, including Episcopal and all three branches of the Lutheran Church, do not ordain women. “I'm very, very mad that the Episco pal Church doesn't ordain women,” said Mrs. Melvin Schlachter, 24 years old, of Huron, Ohio, a third‐year divinity stu dent at Union Theological Seminary. “It's an oppression of women. I don't see how the church can be son con cerned with minority groups and then hold back women.” Barbara Schlachter, spirited, red haired, and freckle‐faced, was sitting in an office at the seminary on Morning side Heights the other day, along with three other women divinity students. They had come to talk about what wom en seminarians were thinking and do ing these, days, and their plans for the future. Wives of Seminarians The others were Mrs. John Mack, 23, of Topton, Pa.; Sharon Ringe, 23, of Exeter, N. H., and Helene Pollock, 22, of Fremont, Nebr. They are among 32 women at the seminary who, along with 244 men, are working for their Bachelor of Divinity degrees. Both Mrs. Schlachter and Mrs. Mack are married to Union seminarians. If the women do go into the ministry after they, get their degrees, they will be joining a select group. In the 1960 census, only 4,727 women listed their occupation as “clergyman,” compared with 201,836 men: None of the four had definitely de cided whether they wanted to be or dained. About the furthest any of them was willing to go was to say they had given “some thought” to it. “I see a real difference between min istry and ordination,” said Mrs. Schlach ter, who was raised a Methodist (now United Methodist) and is married to an Episcopalian. “I work part‐time as hospital chaplain, and if I were ordained, it wouldn't make a bit of difference in my job. “But sometimes at the hospital,” she went on, “I feel like wearing a big sign that says: ‘Dammit, I am not a volun teer. This is my work.’” Another of the women's complaints was that the denominations that do or dain women (United Methddist and United Church of Christ, among others) often limited them to being a church's director of religious education—a job the view as being little more than glorified Sunday School teacher. But despite the obstacles facing them because of their sex, the four said they could not be described as fervent be lievers in the women's liberation move ment. “We're sort of in sympathy,” Miss Pollock said, “but we don't like the radical rhetoric and the simple reduc tions of the movement.” Like many young people today, the four women scorn certain symbols and traditions of the past. When a photo graph of them was to be taken, they asked that a golden cross be removed from the background. (“It's too corny,” Mrs. Mack said.) And none of them plan to use the title, Reverend, even if they someday become parish ministers. “The Reverend tag is really a bar rier,” said Miss Ringe, who works with teen‐agers in the Hell's Kitchen area. “When you use it, all sorts of defenses go up—especially if the people you're working with are not in church.” The quartet agreed on several things: ¶They support the use of churches for community purposes, such as day care centers and as places to serve breakfast to ghetto children. ¶They want to do their work in a, large city. (“The idea of a professional woman is accepted more in a city,” Miss Pollock said.) ¶They do not find the Bible outdated; in fact, they think their Bible courses are “the most exciting and challenging” at the seminary. ¶They favor the newer social pro grams, such as abortion counseling, of fered by such liberal churches as Jud son Memorial Church in Greenwich Vil lage. “Whenever there are human needs, the church should act—even if it's against the law,” Mrs. Mack said un hesitatingly. Mrs. Claude‐Marie (“Sissi”) Barbour has had a far‐ranging religious career. She was raised and educated in France, worked, as a missionary in Africa, be came the first deaconess in the Church of Scotland in Edinburgh, and is now studying for her master's degree in sacred theology at the avant‐garde New York Theological Seminary. A tall and serene brunette in her mid 20's, Mrs.‐Barbour, whose husband is in Scotland, would like to join a team ministry in a ghetto after she gets her degree. “I think that religion as we've known it is dead, but that faith is not dead,” she said, fingering the gold Huguenot cross around her neck. “To believe in God is to believe in humanity. We can find out that. God is alive through man.” Mrs. Barbour is presently working in a church in a Bronx neighborhood where white people are moving out and black people are moving in So far, she and three other seminarians, have set up day‐care center in the church, as well as an after‐school program for childreri. One day, when she went to visit a 13‐ year‐old girl who is a heroin addict, Mrs. Barbour was mugged by a group of youths who had knives. “I was calm and I said; ‘I'm not going to yell’ I tried to show them that I had trust and faith. They took illy $5, but they gave me back $1 to get home on.” Mrs. Barbour believes the church must change drastically if it is ever to become a major force in modern society. “So many things are wrong because we talk so much about what should be the relationship with the church and the Yippies, the church and Vietnam, the church and drug addiction,” she said. “I'm fed up with that. I want the church to become a love community of people, and not try to judge them so ??.” Edna Duggan, 34, of Home cead, Fla., a divorcee with three sons, one of the rare women seminarians who wants to become a parish pastor—or, as she puts it, “an old‐fashioned minister who aware of the world around us.” Miss Duggan (she resumed the “Miss” after her divorce) is a student at Drew Theological School of Drew University, in Madison, N. J. Part of her seminary work includes serving as an assistant pastor of the Trinity United Methodist Church, in Rahway, N. J. ‘A Place for Preaching’ “I think there is still a place for preaching,” said Miss Duggan, who has delivered several sermons in Rahway. “Of course, it is not the drily thing is also important to listen to people when they come for counseling, and to share the feelings that they express.” The slender brunette said the only criticism she had received from her congregation concerned the length of the skirts she wore when she was not in her clerical robe. “I used to wear my skirts, above my knees,” she said, “but the parishioners felt that was too short for a lady minis ter. Now I wear longer ones when there.” Her usual church attire, she said, is a black jumper and a white blouse. She calls the outfit “my clerics.” Miss Duggan was divorced from her husband, an engineer, soon after she en tered the seminary in 1965. She blames it on her “growing inaependence.” And because of her status as a divorcee, she expects to encounter some problems after ordination, when she hopes to be assigned to a church. “It [the divorce] will have to, be dealt with,” she said evenly. “Society is not ready to consider it as a healthy thing; it is still thought of as wrong.” Miss Duggan, who entered her senior year last fall with the highest academic average in her class, expects to earn be tween $7,000 and $8,000 when she be comes a full‐time minister. The salary is based on whether a pastor is married or single, she said, and not according to sex. A house is provided rent‐free. Miss Duggan said the rewards of her profession were, for her, three‐fold. “I get satisfaction from researching and writing a sermon,” she said, “and from the interrelationships with the people. But the best is the ministering I receive out of sharing a birth or a death or the joys of a Christian experience.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13 Say Western Union Changed Pro‐Abortion Wires to Anti,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/07/archives/13-say-western-union-changed-proabortion-wires-to-anti.html,"Thirteen members of the Rockaway Park chapter of the American Jewish Congress have charged “deliberate decesp tion” by Western Union in the handling of telegrams they sent to their Assemblyman in Al bany on the abortion reform bill.  On March 26, they said, they filed 13 individually singed, identically worded telegrams urging Assemblyman Herbert A. Posner, a Queens Democrat, to vote for the bill. The 13 telegrams Mr. Posner received urged him to, vote against the bill. The wording of the one‐sentence message had been completeely changed. A spokesman for Westeren Union said yesterday that the company “acknowledges the mistake and will apologize” to the people involved. An investi gation has beeen started. “Apparently it was an honest mistake,” the spokesman said. “Somebody had two piles of messages; pros and cons, and in the rush to get them out attached the wrong signatures.” The spokesman added that Western Unon employees were subject to immediate dismissal if they were found to have tampered with telegrams. Mr. Posner, who voted for the reform bill, said he be came suspiciouss when he recognized the name of one of the 13 signers. She was Mrs. Jean Larkin, a local Democrat ic district leader known to be in favor reform. He said he had received about 100 other telegrams at the same time from another sec tion of his district, each of which carried the same mes sage as the one on the 13 from Rockaway Park. All read: “Urge that you de feat Senate‐approved abortion bill.” The original message filed by the 13 was: “Urge you vote affiramatively on the Cook Leichter bill to repeal New York's antiquated abortion law.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NEW VOTE SOUGHT ON ABORTION BILL,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/08/archives/new-vote-sought-on-abortion-bill-mrs-cook-is-filing-today-challenge.html,"ALBANY, April 7—Support ers of legislation to reform the abortion law will begin to revive the issue tomorrow when the Legislature returns from a week's recess and begins the push for final adjournment of the 1970 session.  Assemblyman Constance Cook, Ithaca Republican, said today she would file a motion tomorrow to reconsider the re form bill that was defeated last week. “This will allow the bill to be reconsidered on Thursday,” Mrs. Cook said, “and I just have a feeling that we're go ing to get this bill this year. In fact, I am cautiously hope ful that we will pick up an other vote or two by Thurs day.” The bill, sponsored by Mrs. Cook and others in the As sembly, missed by three votes gaining the 76 votes necessary for passage last week, when Assembly Speaker Perry B. Duryea, Jr. refused to count absentee votes. Had the absentee votes been counted, as is usual, the re form bill would have had 75 yes votes. And Mr. Duryea had earlier promised that in such an event he would provide the 76th vote to pass the bill. Based on this positive count of 76 votes—if all yes votes are recorded — Mrs. Cook used parliamentary maneuver to keep the measure alive to allow another vote this week. Provisions of Bill Mrs. Cook's bill would repeal the present 19th‐century law— which allows abortions only to save the woman's life—with one that would allow an abor tion for any reason, up to the 24th week of pregnancy, if agreed to by the woman and her physician. After the 24th week, under the Cook bill, an abortion could be performed only to save the expectant mother's life. Assemblyman Herbert J. Mil ler, Queens Democrat, one of the co‐sponsors of the bill and one of the absentee members whose “yes” vote went unre corded last week, said today that he would challenge the procedure followed by Mr. Dur yea at that time. “What he did tin effect,” Mr. Miller said, “was to change the tally and change my vote and the vote of Assemblyman Hulan Jack [Brooklyn Democrat, who was also absent] from ‘yes’ to ‘not present’.” Mr. Miller said he would challenge this maneuver tomor row and demand that the Speaker re‐count the vote. “It seems to me,” he said, “that. M. Duryea must redress the grievous wrong done by order ing this re‐count or the onus is upon him to seek approval of Mrs. Cook's motion to recon sider the bill.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Letters to the Editor of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/08/archives/letters-to-the-editor-of-the-times.html,"The criticism leveled against Judge Carswell recalls that made against Louis Brandeis, nominated by Woodrow Wilson in January 1916, and confirmed several weeks later after much bitter debate. The New York Sun wrote that Brandeis was “utterly and even ridiculously unfit.” The New York Press called the nomination “an in sult to members of the Supreme Court.” Opposition was also voiced by The Boston Trahs script and The New York Times.  Critics of Court Choice To the Editor: Former President Taft, Chief Justice from 1921 to 1930, suf fered “a fearful shock” in learn ing of the Brandeis nomination. A petition signed by “Fifty five Bostonians” urged the Sen ate to reject Brandeis. The dis tinguished list included A. Lawrence Lowell, President of Harvard, and Charles Francis Adams. Among other objections, the petitioners asserted that they did not “believe that Mr. Bran deis has the judicial tempera ment and capacity which should be required in a judge of the Supreme Court” and that his “reputation as a lawyer is such that he has not the confidence of the people.” The American Bar Associa tion lent its lungs to the swell ing chorus of dissent. “A pain ful duty,” the lawyers lamented, compelled them to charge that “the reputation, character and professional career” of the nominee proves that he is “not a fit person to be a member of the Supreme Court.” Among those who signed this petition were seven past presidents of the Bar Association. In spite of such formidable opposition, Brandeis won con firmation and served for 21 years on the high tribunal. Many knowledgeable students of the Court would rank him alongside of the two or three most distir guished Justices of this century. FRANCIS WILLIAM O'BRIEN Professor of Constitutional Law Rockford College Rockford, Ill., April 3, 1970 • Consent of Senate To the Editor: President Nixon ought to re read his own messages. He contradicts himself. Several months ago in a statement he said Congress and the Presi dent are coequal branches of government. On April 1 he denied that constitutional con cept by intimating that the Senate was denying his right to appoint members to the United States Supreme Court. What President Nixon fails to ascertain is that his right to appoint is but one‐half of the balance and the coequal half is the check of advice and consent. [Editorial April 3.] The constitutional principle of checks and balances is well served both by the President and the Senate in their actions, each to serve the needs of gov ernment as they determine it. For President Nixon to assume anything but coequal branches of government is to refute de mocracy and elected represen tation. CAROL S. TWERSKY Professor of Government Manhattan Community College New York, April 3, 1970 • Abortion Reform To the Editor: There is wide agreement among health professionals that the present abortion laws are archaic, punitive and dis criminatory. In our judgment, this approach to unwanted pregnancy is one of the major factors in a network of social ills. [Editorial March 20.] The unavailability of volun tary termination of pregnancy plays an important role in per petuating poverty and in the deterioration of the quality of life of the poor. It is the poor who suffer most under the pall of a legal arrangement which denies them that freedom of choice which in fact is avail able to many middle and upper class citizens through illegal and semilegal procedures. Furthermore, the existing laws in this state interfere with the provision of professionally responsible medical, psycho logical and social services to a large number of pregnant women. This is an intolerable condition for the health profes sional as well as for his patient or client. Only by shifting the respon sibility into the appropriate hands—those of the patient and the professional of her choice —can we, as health profes sionals, function in a manner which will give the service for which we were trained and for which our community is de pendent on us. In our view, the absence of rational and humane abortion laws leads directly to a wide range of medical and psycho logical problems. The conse quences for mother, child, family and society of innumer able unwanted pregnancies carried to completion consti tutes a public health hazard of major proportions. It is our belief that no single legislative act at this time could produce greater gains in phys ical, mental and social well being for more individuals of all classes than could the re form currently before the New York State Assembly. VICTOR W. SIDEL, M.D. NORMAN HERZIG, M.D. HERBERT WEINER, M.D. MARTIN CHERKASKY, M.D. Montefiore Hospital and Medical Center, Bronx, N. Y., March 26, 1970 • Trend Toward Violence To the Editor: The six‐month term of “con finement” given to Lieut. James B. Duffy for his murder of a Vietnamese civilian must be re garded as a kind of tacit ap proval of his actions. It will have a profound effect upon those officers and enlisted men who have killed civilians and will continue to kill under a variety of justifications such as the necessity for higher “head count,” or as a matter of course in search and destroy missions. As a veteran I view with in creasing alarm the insensitivity of both the military and the “silent majority” toward bru tality and violence. It is ap parently not enough stimulation for us merely to see, with in creasing frequency, bloody ri ots, assassinations and genocide. We see all of this on tele vision as news; we also pay to see more and more violence on the movie screen, and in litera ture. In fact, there seems to be a strong indication that we feel we need this exposure to vio lence. Isn't it interesting to note, however, how we have man aged to keep ourselves above feeling anything, from pain to remorse, in the midst of all this? It is all right as long as some; one else's boy is being maimed or killed and as long as we re main on this side of the acticin. I think that if the present trend continues, we will not re main long on this side of vio? lence. In fact, we will not re main long. ROBERT B. TYLER Stony Brook, L. I., April 1, 1970 • Prelude to Anarchy To the Editor: For the first time in many a moon you have come up with an editorial that I, a consetva tive, can heartily applaud. Your March 19 “Postal An archy” pulls no punches. But the mob action and disrespect for our laws which you now revile have had their inception in protest marches, campus dis orders, picket lines, black mili tancies and other disruptions long staged under the guise of civil liberties. They have been countenanced by our courts and weak‐kneed politicians, not to mention our spineless publishers and church leaders. ALFRED R. Rose Tenafly, N. J., March 19, 1970 • What Is Ecology?

Some Teachers at N.Y.U. Demand Dean's Ouster,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/08/archives/some-teachers-at-nyu-demand-deans-ouster.html,"A controversy has flared at New York University over Dr. Ivan L. Bennett Jr., dean of the Medical School, with some faculty members demanding his ouster for past research on biological and chemical war fare. Dean Bennett was upheld yesterday by Dr. David Z. Robinson, university vice presi dent for academic affairs, as, “probably the person most re sponsible for the elimination of biological weapons from the American arsenal.” Dr. Bennett himself managed to deliver a lecture on arms control and disarmament to 600 people at the Medical School, 550 First Avenue, which demon strators had blocked last Wed nesday. In this, he said, “I wish to see chemical and bio logical weapons abolished com pletely.” Yesterday afternoon, 100 stu dents, with an assistant profes sor of history, Robert D. Wolfe, among their leaders, poured into a room at the Washington Square campus in which the faculty of Washing ton Square College was to take up a resolution by two faculty members seeking Dean Ben nett's resignation. The students described them selves as members of he De cember 4 Movement, named for the date on which a Black Panther leader was killed in Chicago, and included others from Students from a Demo cratic Society. Dean R. Bayly Winder of the college declared he was “not calling the meeting to order Ido not believe the faculty can carry out its business under the threat of hooligan intimida tion.” When the unauthorized students refused to leave the room, Dean Winder called off the session. The resolution against Dean Bennett had been submitted by Jack D. Zipes, assistant pro fessor of German, and Bertell Oilman, assistant professor of politics. Both stayed with about a dozen other faculty members to hear proposals by the stu dent demonstrators. At the end of that session, vote by the faculty group as sertedly approved all the dem onstrator's proposals except for the ouster of Dean Bennett. The other proposals called for the university to put up $.3‐million bail for Black Panthers, provide community control for its med ical facilities and support “free abortion on demand.” Dean Bennett, 48 years old, came to New York University on Jan. 21, 1969, as vice presi dent for health affairs and director of the Medical Center. He became dean of the School of Medicine last March 16. A bio‐medical scientist, he had been deputy scientific ad viser to President Johnson from 1966. During the first half of last year, he served as United States member of a United Na tions commission whose report urged “the earliest effective eli mination” of biological and chemical weapons. For yesterday's abortive fa culty meeting, Dr. Robinson, had prepared a statement that asserted that “Dr. Bennett was heavily involved in the decision of the Nixon Administration to ban all use of biological wea pons, even in retaliation.” Dean Bennett, Dr. Robinson's statement added, was also in volved in President Nixon's “later decision to ban all manu facture and use of toxins as well.” Dr. Robinson had pro posed a resolution to apologize for “the irresponsible and un professional actions” of faculty members urging the dean's ouster.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Senate already has given its approval to this urgent measure; it would now be on its way to Governor Rockefeller for signa ture if parliamentary maneuvering by Speaker Duryea had not kept it from mustering the requisite majority in the Assembly when it was first considered.  The abortion reform bill would place responsibility where it should be in a modern and free society—in the decision of a woman and her physician. Nothing, of course, would prevent a woman from not having an abortion on religious or other personal grounds. The time for rhetoric is over.

ASSEMBLY REVIVES BILL ON ABORTION FOR 2D VOTE TODAY,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/09/archives/assembly-revives-bill-on-abortion-for-2d-vote-today-duryea-orders.html,"ALBANY, April 8—Support ers of abortion reform revived their bill to end the present state law after tortuous parlia mentary maneuvering during which 12 absent members were ordered brought to the cham ber “by whatever force neces sary.  The motion to reconsider the bill—which was narrowly de feated last week—passed by 92‐to‐52 vote. The vote, how ever, is no indication of the eventual fate of the bill since many members who opposed liberalization voted to recon sider it to avoid charges of killing the bill by parliamentary tactics. The Assembly will vote to morrow on the reform measure sponsored by Assemblyman Constance E. Cook, and its supporters are cautiously optimistic, describing its pros pects as “a toss‐up.” Full Assembly Ordered Today's vote came only after Assembly Speaker Perry B. Dur yea refused to allow a vote on the motion to reconsider the bill until all members of the Assembly were present. As it turned out, the Speaker had little trouble rounding up the absentee members. His of fice reported that they were located through their offices by telephone and that there was no need to resort to use of sergeants at arms or the state police to compel attendance. Mr. Duryea took the action— unique in the memory of the oldest members of the Legisla ture—when opponents of abor tion reform unexpectedly chal lenged a motion to reconsider the vote under which the abor tion reform bill was narrowly defeated last week. If the motion to reconsider the bill had been defeated, the issue would have been dead for this session. The harshness of Mr. Duryea's ruling reflects the criticism of him that followed his decision last week when h refused to count the preregis tered votes of two absente members—a courtesy tradition ally extended to Assembly members. Those two votes would have given the abortio reform bill 75 votes — only on short of the 76 needed to pass. In such an event, Mr. Duryea had pledged to provide the 76th vote to pass the bill. By not counting the absentee votes however, he avoided casting the deciding vote. He was then ac cused by one of the absentee members — Assemblyman Herbert J. Miller, a Queen Democrat—with altering the the tally sheet and changing the outcome of the vote. No issue in recent years has resulted In the degree of bitterness and emotion as the abortion reform issue has pro duced this year. Early in March the Senate passed a bill that, in effect, would repeal the present abortion law, which al lows an abortion only to save the mother's life. The Senate bill would make an abortion strictly a matter between the mother and her physician, with restrictions. After Senate passage the an tireform lobby, made up primarily or the Catholic Church and the State Med ical Society, firecely fought the repeal. Because or this pressure, sup porters of the bill who thought they had the necessary 76 votes “locked up” now de scribe the situation as “touch and go” if the bill Is revived. There was less concern about the motion to reconsider hi cause even opponents of the bill were furious with today's parlimentary maneuvering. Mrs. Cook made her motion to reconsider casually at 1:30 this afternoon, and had expect ed no opposition. However, As semblyman Lawrence E. Cor bett Jr. demanded a “slow roll call” — one in which each member would have to vote yea or nay on the motion. With 12 members absent 10 Democrats who supported the hill last week and two Re publicans who opposed — ottppeared clear the motion would be defeated.

Abortion Bill Advocate,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/09/archives/abortion-bill-advocate-constance-eberhardt-cook.html,"ALBANY, April 8 — Con stance E. Cook has led the fight for abortion reform in the State Assembly this year in a tailored, matronly manner, rarely raising her voice and never doubting ul timate success.  “She doesn't overplay her femininity on this,” Assembly Speaker Perry B. Duryea said today, sea crediting the sea soned 50‐year‐old legislator with de emphasizing t h e emotions of the issue. Mrs. Cook, a mother of two chil dren, feels the abortion debate this year is the final stage in an inevitable victory for women. Woman in the News “The whole thing is really not that tough,” Mrs. Cook, Republican from Ithaca, says. “It's basically an educational process, with legislators fi nally understanding the issue and with the public ahead of them on it.” Last weekend, after the narrow first‐round defeat of the Assembly's abortion re form bill, Mrs. Cook reset her resolve and escaped with her family to a two‐acre island they own in Lake Tomagami, in the Canadian wilderness. During the first part of the trip north, a 500‐mile auto journey, the Cook fa mily discussed the issue as they read newspaper ac counts and Mrs. Cook briefly outlined this week's strategy. Aide to Dewey “And then, by and by, it was talked out, and Connie never brought it up again,” Alfred P. Cook, the legisla tor's husband recalled. The next part of the journey was by snowmobile, and, before long, Mrs. Cook was hum ming by a log‐cabin fire, cooking french toast and looking forward to the 5‐de gree outdoors, with the near est telephone 30 miles away. Mrs. Cook entered politics quietly and diligently, serv ing as a law assistant to Gov ernor Thomas E. Dewey and then on legislative commit tees involved with such mat ters as unemployment insu rance and fire laws. Mrs. Cook, a graduate of the Cornell University Law School and a Fulbright scholar, showed a talent for grasping complex issues and did much of the spadework that holstered and pleased Republican lawmakers. In 1962, she dared to make waves in the sprawling 125th Assembly District — an ex panse of retreating farmlands, growing colleges and smoky factory towns—by being the first woman candidate for the area's Iegislative seat. Mrs. Cook won the election after a primary fight. Soon after arriving in Albany, Mrs. Cook chose as a specialty one of the perennial head aches of the Legislature — education law, and in partic ular the complicated system of formulas that produces state school aid to localities. Last week, on the day after abortion reform failed on the first push, Mrs. Cook stood as the Republican expert on this year's $2‐billion school aid bill and led the majority bill to passage. There was nothing Aunt Pollyish about the way she dealt with the men. Earlier in this session, she joined the three other women in the 150‐member Assembly in proposing that the rights and problems of women be looked into by a joint legis lative committee on women. “We move onto that one after abortion,” Mrs. Cook said today. Off‐Beat Quality There is a lightly off‐beat quality to Mrs. Cook. She campaigns in a 1924 Packard touring car that has a small Connie Cook bumper sticker and her husband, a part‐time consultant to food stores, at the wheel. The auto was pro vided as a lark by her brother‐in‐law, but it has re mained as an affectionate note in the grinding, lengthy upstate campaign. Mrs. Cook was born on Aug. 17, 1919, in Cleveland and moved to New York when her father, the late Walter Eberhardt, got a job as a construction engineer on the building of Rockefeller Center. She attended Hunter College High School and, ac cording to her husband, went in for fencing and rowing. “But now we mainly exer cise by walking the perimeter of our grounds,” Mr. Cook said, referring to their five‐ acre Ithaca homesite near Lake Cayuga. Mrs. Cook married her hus band, a widower, in 1954 and they have two children, Cath erine, 13, who talks of a pos sible medical career, and John, 7, who lately is most impressed with the Indians who trap beavers near the Cook's Canadian retreat.

"ABORTION REFORM IS VOTED BY THE ASSEMBLY, 76 TO 73; FINAL APPROVAL EXPECTED",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/10/archives/abortion-reform-is-voted-by-the-assembly-76-to-73-final-approval.html,"ALBANY, April 9—The dra matic last‐minute switching of a single vote in the Assembly today moved New York State a step closer to the reform of its abortion law.  By a tally of 76 to 73, the Assembly voted to send to the Senate a bill that woud remove all but one restriction on abor tions in the state. Since the Senate passed last month by a 31‐to‐26 vote an even more lib eral version of the bill — one with no restrictions — sponsors in that house are optimis tic the Assembly bill will be ac cepted when the Senate con siders it. Governor Rockefeller has urged abortion reform this year and is expected to sign the bill if it reaches his desk. An upstate Democrat, his voice choked with emotion, in terrupted the roll‐call at the last minute to switch his vote in a reversal that provided the key vote to pass the bill. Stopped Roll‐Call The Assemblyman, George M. Michaels of Auburn, his hands trembling and tears welling in his eyes, stopped the roll‐call only seconds before the clerk was to announce that the re form bill had been defeated for lack of a single vote. Seventy‐six votes are re quired to pass an Assembly bill and without Assemblyman Mi chaels's vote the bill would have been defeated. “I realize, Mr. Speaker,” Mr. Michaels said, “that I am termi nating my political career, but I cannot in good conscience sit here and allow my vote to be the one that defeats this bill— I ask that my vote be changed from ‘no’ to ‘yes.’” In the confusion that followed —as secretaries applauded the move with tears streaming down their cheeks—few people saw Mr. Michaels slump in his chair holding his head in his hands, or heard Speaker Perry B. Duryea ask that his name be called so that he, as Speaker, could provide the final vote for passage. After four years of concentrated effort and two long, emotional debates this year, the Assembly removed one of the remaining barriers to reform of the present law, which was passed in 1830 and which al lows an abortion only to save a woman's life. The bill passed today would allow an abortion for any reason up to the 24th week of preg nancy and after that only to save the woman's life. How ever, abortions are normally performed during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. The Sen ate version of the bill would leave an abortion up to a wom an and her physician, with no restrictons. Mr. Michaels's dramatic move came after four hours of debate during which five other Assembly members changed positions that they had record ed last week when the bill was defeated, but kept alive for the final vote today. Three of those changes were from “yes” to “no” and as today's roll‐call moved toward an end, it ap peared that the bill would be defeated. Assemblyman Constance E. Cook, Republican of Ithaca and chief sponsor of the reform bill, was keeping her own tally and had given the bill up for lost when Mr. Michaels rose to save it from defeat. Changes of votes from those cast last week reflected the intense lobby mounted over the weekend by the Roman Catho lic Church, a sentiment ex pressed by Assemblyman Anthony J. Stella, Bronx Demo crat, who switched from a “yes” to a “no” vote. “Last week I thought I cast a vote representing the people who live in my area—it is over whelmingly Catholic—and I did so because I thought it was not my job to legislate my own morality,” said Mr. Stella, a Catholic. “But I was wrong. My fellow parishioners expressed their surprise that I voted the way I did and made clear their feelings to me.” Other Catholic members, in cluding some who did not switch their votes, reported in tensive church pressure, includ ing denunciations from the pul pit last Sunday. One member reported that in his Catholic church in Brooklyn on Sunday, a young daughter sat by his side as he and others who supported the bill last week were described by the parish priest as “murderers.” “It was very tough pressure,” this member said, “but I think the lay Catholic is far ahead of the church on this issue.” Another Catholic, Assembly man Charles Rangel—a Man hattan Democrat and a Negro— denounced church pressure on the bill. “My church,” Mr. Rangel said, “saw fit to have my name called as one who acted im properly. And had it printed in the parish newspaper. But, I am hurt and disappointed that the clergy did not so act when we tried to stop the welfare cut backs, or get decent housing, or get basic health care and hot water for our people. “They did see fit to urge the parishioners to write me on the question of financial help for patochial schools and to pro tect the vested interest of their schools. But, I am amazed be cause I didn't receive one let ter from a member about my vote.” The religious argument over the bill grew in intensity as the debate neared an end. Other Catholics on both sides of the issue argued that their religious convictions did net form the basis of their votes. Instead, they argued, it was a moral issue and one dealing with individual con cepts of life and death. One Assemblyman opposed to the law, Neil S. Kelleher, a Republican of Troy, said the issue simply was one of “murder.” “It's our baby, so to speak,” Mr. Kelleher said, his face red with anger. “I say, look at your own hands before you vote on this bill.” Woman Is Stilled Picking up this theme, an other opponent, Assemblyman John T. Gallagher, Queens Re publican, warned his col leagues: “I point the finger at every member who votes for this bill and say, ‘You, sir, killed these innocent children.’” At one point during the height of the debate, an elderly woman in the galleries had to be stilled by the capitol police. “Murderer,” she called out, her thin voice quivering in the still chamber. “You are mur derers, that's what you are. God will punish you. You are mur derers.” Similar emotional strains were woven through the debate in an ever recurrent thread that dominated all other arguments. Mrs. Cook had attempted to guide debate with her opening statement along more prag matic lines. “This entire effort,” Mrs. Cook said, “has been educa tional. It's just a matter of de ciding that you can't sit here and decide who and when and how an abortion is to be per formed — they are being per formed now. My object is to get this whole question into the hands of a doctor and into the hospitals.” Much of the debate was a repetition of the hours already devoted to the measure this year and as the roll was called, it seemed clear that the vote would be a repeat, of last week's narrow defeat. When Mr. Michaels, who is convinced most of hs constitu ents oppose reform, rose to offer the key vote, the battery of television cameramen were caught unaware, with their lens trained on the Speaker's chair to record the announcement that the bill was defeated. Mr. Michaels's first words were lost in the noise and confusion as cameramen jostled for position. His face drained of color and his hands barely grasping the microphone, Mr. Michaels told of the fierce feelings within his own family over his opposi tion to the bill. “My own son,” Mr. Michaels said, sobbing, “my own son called me a whore for voting against this bill. And my other son begged me not to let my vote be the one that defeated the bill.” The other son Mr. Michaels referred to is a student at the Hebrew Theological Seminary in Cincinnati, and he served as Assembly chaplain for one day earlier in the session. “I must,” Mr. Michaels said, “keep peace in my family.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hospitals Called Unprepared For Wave of Abortion Requests,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/10/archives/hospitals-called-unprepared-for-wave-of-abortion-requests.html,"Hospitals across the state— both public and private—have done virtually nothing to pre pare for the demand that is expected when and if the liber alized legislation on abortion goes into effect.  In New York City alone it is estimated 50,000 to 100,000 wo men will seek abortions every year. This estimate comes from a prominent birth‐control advo cate, Dr. Alan Guttmacher of Planned Parenthood‐World Pop ulation. Dr. Guttmacher has been con ferring in recent weeks with the chief obstetricians of large teaching hospitals here, urging them to make plans for an over whelming demand. He has encountered resist ance from both hospital admin istrators and physicians. Many of the doctors agree in principle that women should receive abortions on request, but they do not wish to become involved personally in what they believe may become an assembly‐line procedure. Health‐insurance executives are maintaining what one de scribed yesterday as “a very alert stand‐by position.” A vice president of Blue Cross, George Godlett, said his organization had not yet decided what policy to establish, in terms of ac tuarial costs. Blue Cross insurance covers hospitalization for therapeutic abortions that are legal under the current law, which has been interpreted with increasing flexibility in recent years. And one expert noted yesterday that it would be less expensive for Blue Cross to pay for a hospital stay in an abortion than for a full‐term pregnancy. Most physicians, in Dr. Gutt macher's view, are far too cau tious when they insist that abortions be performed only in a hospital. “There simply isn't room enough,” he said the other day. “I'd want to rent a loft or a store and put in 25 beds. The operation really isn't that com plicated. In fact, it doesn't usu ally require a physician.” He asserted that non‐physi cians could, after brief training, safely perform routine abor tions. The Department of Hospitals here has established no city wide policy. Each of the 18 mu nicipal hospitals has its own committee on therapeutic abor tions, which decides each case on its merits. At Bellevue the chief of ob stetrics, Dr. Gordon Douglas, says his staff is “extremely anx ious to see the poor have the same advantages as the wealthy” in obtaining abortions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SPEEDIER DIVORCE GAINS IN ALBANY,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/10/archives/speedier-divorce-gains-in-albany-state-senate-bill-would-cut.html,"ALBANY, April 9—Without debate, the Senate passed and sent to the Assembly today a bill cutting the waiting period for a divorce from two years to one.  The bill, sponsored by Sena tor Roy M. Goodman, Republi can of Manhattan, also would make marriage counseling and conciliation services voluntary. The present law requires that husbands and wives involved in matrimonial actions seek such services. While the assembly spent the greater part of the day again debating, and finally passing by the narrowest of margins, a bill to liberalize the state's abortion law, the Senate also passed a bill designed to make it easier to obtain convictions against drunken drivers. In commenting on the reduc tion in the waiting period for a divorce after a separation de cree has been granted by the courts, Mr. Goodman said: “Liv ing apart for one year Is ample proof of the death of a mar riage, and making people wait an extra year puts unecessary obstacles in the way of those attempting to start new lives and families.” Hasty Marriages a Concern The bill also increases the waiting period before a mar riage can be performed to 10 days after a couple has taken the required serological tests. The present waiting period is three days. “This will help prevent hasty and ill‐advised marriages,” Mr. Goodman said. The measure was passed with no dissenting votes. The drunken ‐ driving bill, part of Governor Rockefeller's proposed highway safety pro gram, would make it a viola tion for a driver to operate an automobile if the alcoholic content of his blood exceeded 0.15 per cent. The existing law regards the presence of that amount of al cohol, based on chemical analy sis, as prima facie evidence of drunkeness, but it also requires saw‐enforcement officials to provide other evidence, such as testimony about the driver's appearance. The Governor's bill, spon sored by six Republicans and three Democrats, would allow conviction based solely on the determination of the amount of alcohol in a driver's blood. Senator Manfred Ohrenstein of Manhattan, one of the four Democrats who voted against the bill as it passed, 48 to 4, said that the bill would penal ize “social drinkers” based on a contention that “two jiggers of Scotch will bring you up to 0.15.” Variables Cited Last January, when the bill, was proposed, however, the State Police Department re ported that the amount of alcohol it took to reach 0.15 per cent depended upon a per son's size and how recently he had eaten. For example, a 170 ‐ pound man who had recently eaten an average dinner would have to drink just under 11 one‐ ounce shots of 80‐proof liquor within two hours or so after dining to reach the 0.15 level. If he had not eaten recently, about eight shots would suf fice, a department spokesman said. First‐offenders convicted of drunken driving at present are guilty of a misdemeanor and are subject to revocation of their driver's licenses and the possibility of imprisonment rip to a year and a fine of $500. A second offense within 10 years of the first is considered a felony and carries a fine of op to $2,000 and up to two years in prison. The Senate bill would not alter these pro visions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Greater Emphasis on Research Held Key to Birth Control Gains,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/10/archives/greater-emphasis-on-research-held-key-to-birth-control-gains.html,"BOSTON, April 9 — New breakthroughs in contraceptive technology comparable in im pact to birth control pills will require greater emphasis on basic research into the repro ductive process, Dr. Roy Hertz, a researcher, said here today.  “We've got to go back to where we were with proges terone 25 years ago before we can come up with new ap proaches to contraception,” Dr. Hertz said at the eighth annual meeting of the American Association of Planned Parent hood Physicians. Progesterone is one of the female sex hor mones that, in synthetic form, are contained in the oral con traceptives. Dr. Hertz, a physician who has devoted his career to bio logical research, is an associate director of the Population Coun cil, an independent research and family planning organization. He said “growing disillusion ment” with present methods of contraception necessitated radi cal departures from them. Unknown Hazards He cited as reasons for the disillusionment the known and unknown medical hazards of the oral contraceptives and the difficulties in gaining wide spread acceptance of this and other currently available con traceptive methods among poor ly motivated persons. Dr. Hertz is now going back to the drawing boards in an effort to devise techniques that he hopes will circumvent these problems. One approach, he said at the meeting at the Statler Hilton Hotel, involves the vitamin fol ic acid, originally found in leafy vegetables. Folic acid is essential to the growth of the womb during pregnancy and to the survival of the fetus. Dr. Hertz said he was look ing for a substance that inter feres with the body's ability to use folic acid and does so in such a way that the embryo would be destroyed selectively without irreversibly injuring the woman. Such a substance might be used as a “orning‐after” con traceptive, taken only after in tercourse occurred at a time that was likely to result in pregnancy. “One of the most exciting things in this field,” Dr. Hertz remarked at a news conference after his talk, is a hormone like substance called prosta glandin F2 Alpha, which is un der study in England, Sweden and Uganda as an abortion causing agent. Work on Improvements Since the prostaglandin is capable of causing an abortion at virtually any stage of preg nancy, it might prove useful as a morning‐after type contra ceptive, Dr. Hertz suggested. With radically new ap proaches to contraception ap parently rather far in the fu ture, many of Dr. Hertz's col leagues are working on im provements in currently avail able techniques. To avoid the problem of con tinued motivation, researchers at the Population Council have developed a contraceptive cap sule that is implanted under the skin and removed only when the woman desires to become pregnant. This capsule is now being tested in women in sev eral countries abroad. Dr. Hugh J. Davis, an obste trician at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, reported at the meeting here today that a new shield‐shaped intrauterine device designed by him was “superior” to present devices both in preventing pregnancy and in terms of the percentage of women able to retain it without ill effects. Dr. Davis said that, unlike most such devices used today the shield could he retained comfortable even by women who had never horne children.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LOBBIES INCLUDED WIVES AND CLERGY,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/11/archives/lobbies-included-wives-and-clergy-tears-kisses-and-angered.html,"ALBANY, April 10—The ad vice and pressure on Assembly men who voted for and against abortion reform yesterday were as personal as a midnight chat with a wife and as sensitive as a personal call from a monsig nor. George M. Michaels, an Au burn Democrat, gave the most anguished evidence of this in his tear‐filled, last‐minute change of vote, which saved the reform bill from defeat. Wiping his eyes, he indicated weariness with an issue that has brought torment in an election year. He spoke of the need for “peace in my family,” noting one of his sons had called him a “whore” for voting against reform previously. Earlier in the roll‐call, Hulan E. Jack, the Harlem Assembly man, changed his vote in the other direction, from “Yes” to “No,” pleading his conscience. “My monsignor raised Cain with me, he practically lived with me,” Mr. Jack said smil ingly today. But like all the lawmakers, Mr. Jack said he was not dictated to. Mr. Jack indicated in the de bate that he feared the poor would get inferior medical care under the bill. In the hubbub that followed proval of the bill, Mr. Michaels wept at his desk as a colleague, Lucio F. Russo, a Staten Island Conservative‐Republican, furi ously denounced him. Vote an Impulse “In other words, vote your family, and the hell with your constituents!” Mr. Russo shout ed at Mr. Michaels, who has won his Assembly seat by nar row margins in a district that is predominantly conservative and Republican, and heavily Catholic. Albert H. Blumenthal, the Manhattan Democrat who has pioneered the move for abor tion reform, kissed Mr. Michaels on the forehead. Hours later, Mr. Michaels still broke into tears as he told how “largely by impulse” he chose the view of himself and his family of what he felt was the view of most of his constituents. Today, the Legislator showed friends a telegram from his married daughter‐in‐law Sarah, in whcih she said she was “so proud of you and love you.” Less obvious was the pres sure felt by other men. One Assemblyman, also from a heavily Catholic district, who supported the measure said he was cited by name from his area's pupils last Sunday and one man greeted him: “Hi, how are you, murderer.” “My wife (a Catholic and schoolteacher) prayed for me and said vote for the bill.” The Assemblyman said, “She had a 12 year‐old girl in a class who was pregnant. What can you do?” Some members said privately that some of the Catholic pres sure was set‐off by the lobby ing efforts of local women's and Prostestant groups: One member said the Committee for Progressive Legislation, a local Prostestant group here, was instrumental in changing the mind of at least one law maker. Marry Ann Krupsak, an up state Democrat who switched twice on the issue was cited by her Bishop last week on the steps of the Capitol as k need of prayer. Miss Krupsak vited “no” in a preliminary round after this, but then voted “yes” yesterday. Several men said that members of old‐line organizations, such as individuals in the Lea gue of Women Voters who pre sented data to their Assembly men, were more effective than some women activists who were gripped by emotional issues. In other crucial vote changes, Anthony J. Stella, a Brooklyn Democrat, appeared to have doomed the bill when he switched to a “No” vote. He told of a flood of angry cem plaints from his largely Catho lic district after his first “yes” vote. And Joseph F. Lisa, Dem ocrat of Queens, switched to a “no” vote yesterday after he failed in an attempt to amend the bill to eplicitly protect Ca tholic physicians and hospitals that refuse to cooperate. He said today that while some col leagues consider the amend ment unnecessary, he and others would continue to push for it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"2,200 at Cornell Meet With Trustees",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/11/archives/2200-at-cornell-meet-with-trustees.html,"ITHACA, N. Y., April 10— In a sharp departure from convention, the board of trustees of Cornell University met today in open forum with 2,200 students and teachers concerned with cam pus racial developments. The meeting was convened hurriedly this afternoon after white sympathizers of black students suggested some kind of exchange of ideas with the 35 trustees, who had been holding a regular meeting in the seclusion of board rooms. It was the first time anyone could remember such a meet ing in the school's 105‐year history. Robert W. Purcell, chair man of the trustees and the head of an international in vestment concern, opened the forum by expressing “the deep concern of the trustees over the fire that destroyed the Africana Center” on April 1. He also spoke of the trus tees' desire to determine who was responsible for the burn ing of the building, which had housed the Center for Black Studies and Research. Demands Listed After Mr. Purcell indicated the board's commitment to replace the burned building, Joel Feigenbaum, a white graduate student, read a list of demands conveyed to him by the Black Liberation Front, an organization of Negro students. These included the comple tion of a new center by the fall term, the provision by the university of cars for the black students now using a building in a remote part of the 700‐acre campus, a com mitment that fiscal responsi bility for the new center be turned over to its black direc tor, Prof. James Turner, and, finally the financing by the ?? of the re rebuilding of a community center dam aged by fire in Ithaca's Negro section. What followed was a se ries of wide‐ranging ques tions from the floor that described the disparate views flourishing here since the April 1 campus fire. Why, asked one campus conservative, were 350 peo ple permitted to sing and frolic about a bonfire last night in violation of a curfew imposed by Cornell's presi dent, Dale R. Corson? Provost Robert Blaine re plied that the gathering at the quadrangle posed no threat to the university and that, in any case, there were not enough campus security men to disperse the offend ers. The questioner grumbled his disgust at the answer while many of those who had been at the bonfire—all of whom hacked the black demands—cheered. Curfew Lifted Then a black student, Stephanie Jones, asked whether the university's re sponse would have been the same had the curfew break ers been black. The provost said it would have. Mrs. Jones responded, “we'll see tonight,” and left before an announcement was made that the curfew was being lifted today. There was also an ex change on the motivation for a restraining order obtained yesterday barring campus demonstrations. The student questioners implied that it was aimed at the blacks after an incident Wednesday night in which many windows were smashed. They argued the university did not feel it was necessary to take such a step after the center was burned down. University spokesmen re plied Mitt the intent of the order was to protect the blacks from any possible re prisals. Jonathan Miller, a student who said he had been ar rested here last year in a campus demonstration, of fered the observation that, unlike last spring, he did not sense any political factors in volved in the current anxiety. “Last year I felt tragedy,” he said. “Now I feel the blacks have picked the wrong tactics. They have chosen to move out against this community, which has to be the most sympathetic community anywhere. I don't think the university is the enemy.” There was one question raised concerning whether trustees had developed any social criteria for the manage ment of Cornell's invest ments. Chares M. Werly, a mutual‐fund consultant who is head of the hoard's in vestment committee, said there was no over‐all policy, but he added that the trustees were scheduled to discuss a threatened General Motors proxy fight over pollution problems. The discussion ambled along amicably. A few speak ers insisted that certain trustees had conomic inter ests in racism because of in vestment tics to South Africa. But there was no name‐calling and no abusive language. Indeed, the most prolonged applause in the hour‐and‐45‐ minute meeting came when President Corson took the podium to reiterate that a new black studies center was going to be built. There was also a long standing ovation for Mrs. Constance E.

News Summary and Index,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/11/archives/news-summary-and-index-the-major-events-of-the-day.html,"SATURDAY, APRIL 11, 1970 International The Senate Foreign Relations Committee unanimously voted yesterday to repeal the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin resolution and the 1957 Middle East resolution. The Johnson Admin istration had often cited the Gulf of Tonkin resolution as authority for United States military involvement in Vietnam, but the Nixon Administration said it did not need the resolution. The Middle East resolution of fered military aid to countries threatened by Communism. [Page 1, Column 5.] Military sources in Pnompenh reported that at least 89 Vietnamese civilians had been killed during an unsuccessful Viet namese Communist attack on Prasot village. The sources said they had been mowed down in a crossfire, but a man who visited the scene cast doubt on that version. [1:4.] West German Chancellor Willy Brandt said in Washington that the security of Europe and the success of negotiations with the Communist countries depended entirely on American military presence on the Conti nent. The Chancellor met with President Nix on and Secretary of State Rogers. [1:4–7.] Prime Minister Ian D. Smith's Rhodesian Front party won an overwhelming majority of the 50 white seats in the new Rhodesian republican Parliament. Sixteen seats in the Parliament were reserved for blacks. [1:8.] Premier George Papadopoulos of Greece announced that martial law was being eased and some constitutional safeguards restored, but he added that the Greek people were not yet ready for the return of a parliamentary democracy. He said that martial law had been curtailed to end arbitrary arrests and to allow the rights of assembly and associa tion and more freedom for the press. [3:5–6.] National Senators who voted against the confirma tion to the Supreme Court of Judge G. Har rold Carswell urged President Nixon to con sider Southerners as well as Northerners for the Court. The Senators, from both parties, were replying to Mr. Nixon's angry charge that the Senate had practiced “re gional discrimination” in its “vicious” and “malicious” defeats of Mr. Carswell and Judge Clement F. Haynsworth Jr. [1:8.] Aides of Gov. Claude R. Kirk Jr. of Florida left the offices of the Manatee County school system at the same time that a Federal District judge was hearing the Governor's coun sel offer no defense to Mr. Kirk's defiance of the court in taking over the system. The judge said he would decide by noon today what punishment, if any, the Governor should receive. [1:7.] The Labor Department reported that the nation's unemployment rate climbed to 4.4 per cent in March from 4.2 per cent in Feb ruary. The number out of work, 3,733,000 last month, was slightly below the February level, but normally there is a big drop in March on seasonal grounds. [1:6–7.] Apollo 13 was cleared for its scheduled launching today with a substitute pilot, John L. Swigert Jr., a civilian, who demonstrated in intensive training sessions that he was able to fill in for the measles‐threatened Thomas K. Mattingly 2d. [1:6–7.] Groups of psychologists, psychiatrists and sociologists denounced a proposal by a for mer personal physician to President Nixon that all children aged 6, 7 and 8 be given psychological tests to predict their potential criminality. The proposal has won Mr. Nixon's personal interest. BUt one sociolo gist said deviancy can mean more than crime potential. “If Michelangelo had been tested at age 7, they'd probably have killed him,” he commented. [15:2–8.] Metropolitan The State Senate passed, 31 to 26, the As sembly's version of a bill that would make abortion a matter between a woman and her doctor during the first six months of preg nancy. A spokesman said Governor Rocke feller would sign the hill. [1:1.] Mayor Lindsay proposed three new taxes affecting city motorists. The taxes—an in crease in the gasoline tax, a registration fee on private cars in the city and an extension of the sales tax to parking lots and garages —were thought to have more support in Al bany than increases in the city's income tax proposed Thursday. [1:2–3.] Student demands for equal representation with teachers on governing hoards at Hunter College High School were approved by the school's faculty members. Dr. Bernard S. Miller, principal of the school, said that the plan was the “most far‐reaching in the coun try” and noted that the equal representation would take place on all items over which the school has jurisdiction.

FINAL APPROVAL OF ABORTION BILL VOTED IN ALBANY,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/11/archives/final-approval-of-abortion-bill-voted-in-albany-rockefeller-to-sign.html,"ALBANY, April 10—The State Senate, after more than two hours of quiet but emotional debate, voted 31 to 26 today to accept an Assembly bill that strikes the state's 140‐year‐old abortion law from the books. Cardinal Cooke issued an ap peal on behalf of the Roman Catholic bishops of the state for Governor Rockefeller to veto the bill, but the Governor said in New York that he would sign the bill tomorrow morning. Today's vote successfully ended a bitter and tenacious campaign begun in 1966 by a Manhattan Democrat Assembly man, Albert H. Blumenthal, to reform the law passed in 1830 that permits an abortion only to save a woman's life. The new law makes an abor tions a matter between a woman and her doctor up to the 24th week of pregnancy. After the 24th week, the new law would allow an abortion only when necessary to save the woman's life. However, abortions generally are per formed during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Started in Colorado Today's vote added New York to a growing list of states caught up in a national wave of abortion reform, beginning with a 1967 Colorado reform law, and is considered a key to possible reform in other states. Emotions continued to run high in the Senate debate to day, but they did not reach the depth and scope of the eight‐ hour session on March 18 when the Senate passed an even more liberal version of the reform bill—one without the 24‐week time limit added in the Assem bly. The vote today was iden tical to that of March 18. Senate Majority Leader Earl W. Brydges, a Niagara Falls Republican whose opposition to reform in past years prevented consideration of such a bill, openly wept as the bill passed. Mr. Brydges, whose craggy features and gritty voice gen erally reflect complete control, rose to end debate on the bill by reading from what he de scribed as “The Dairy of an Unborn Child.” He began to read of a child on the day of conception when—“it is already determ ined even that I will love flowers.” His voice broke and television lights reflected from the tears on his cheeks. “I'm sorry, Mr. President,” he stammered, “I try to keep myself under control...I can not read it all, sir, but I want to read the final entry in this diary, dated Dec. 28 and it says, ‘Today, my parents killed me.’” He dropped to his seat, trembling. Debate Lacks Conviction Except for two of the 13 other speeches, debate lacked any of the conviction that words would sway votes. Fighting to the end, Senator James H. Donovan, Oneida County Republican, pointed an accusing finger at his col leagues and said: “Your hands will reach into the womb with the doctor and you are going to kill, K‐I‐L‐L, when you pass this law. I urge you in God's name not to do this ... Instead, kill this bill and you will please the people of New York. What's more, you will please God.” Senator Thomas Laverne, Rochester Republican, who like Mr. Donovan is a Roman Cath olic and has been under pres sure from his church not to vote for the bill, responded angrily to the religious tone of Mr. Donovan's argument. “How dare anyone say be cause I believe this way every one else should believe this way,” Mr. Laverne said. “I have been told I am obviously not a good Catholic ... Even that I am a phony ... But many do not support the church on this issue, 60 per cent of the Catholics in my district don't agree with the church on this issue.” “I don't think,” he concluded, “I have the right to force my morality on anyone else.” The new law, which will take effect July 1, has raised a num ber of hopes and fears, all of which have been expressed during the three major debates during this session. Primarily, supporters hope the law will end the illegal abortion business that has re sulted in the death or mutila tion of the women involved. These same sponsors, however, warn against what they call “probably unrealizable” hopes that the new law will cause a major reduction in welfare case loads—especially in aid to dependent children. One reason cited for this is that medical societies and hos pitals in those states—as in New York — generally oppose broadly liberal laws and devise regulations that make abortions difficult to obtain even under reformed laws. Doctors to Make Rules The New York State Medical Society has announced that it will devise rules designed to control abortions under the new law, in part to head of the possibility that the state will attract many women from less liberal states and lead to “abortion mills.” Hospitals also are expected to discourage abortion prac tices, primarily because of lim ited and overcrowded facilities. Assemblymen have already moved to further restrict the new law by amendments they hope to pass next week. The amendments would limit abor tions to “licensed hospitals and clinics” and provide that no doctor or hospital can be cited for malpractice for refusing to perform an abortion. The malpractice amendment is designed to calm fears of some Catholic doctors and hos pitals that they might be forced under the new law to perform abortions or face lawsuits. Supports of abortion reform, including women's lobbies and minority group coalitions, are expected to begin campaigns now that the new law is passed to offsset any attempt by medi cal organizations to restrict the law with their own regulations. One lobbyist said today that the campaign would probably take the form of “a person‐to person education and pressure program aimed at individual doctors rather than a struggle with the medical associations.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPEEDY ABORTIONS FAVORED IN STUDY,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/11/archives/speedy-abortions-favored-in-study-doctors-call-overnight-stay-in.html,"BOSTON, April 10—Thera peutic abortions can be per formed simply, safely and in expensively without requiring overnight hospitalization of the woman, a California medical team has concluded after a six‐ month study of the procedure. The results of their study were reported here today by Dr. Alan J. Margolis to the an nual meeting of the American Association of Planned Parent hood Physicians. They indicated that, if the woman entered the hospital in the morning, was aborted in a “come‐and‐go” surgery room and was sent home a few hours later, the compli cation rate was no higher than if she had been hospitalized overnight. These findings could have vast social and medical impli cations for states where liberal ization of abortion laws has swamped hospital facilities with women seeking therapeutic abortions. The findings may also help to make abortion more readily available to the poor by eliminating a costly hospital stay. Special Facilities Urged Some doctors expect that, if repeal of New York's abortion law achieves final passage, 50, 000 to 100,000 New York City women alone will request abor tions each year. The Assembly approved repeal yesterday. Dr. Alan Guttmacher, presi dent of Planned Parenthood World Population, said in an interview here today that the medical profession in New York was “totally unprepared” for this situation. “It's like suddenly finding yourself with a million dollars and not knowing how to spend it,” he remarked. He proposed that special fa cilities, which he called “abor toriums,” be established to help meet the anticipated demand. Such a facility, where 20 abor tions a day might be per formed, would be connected with a hospital that could han dle the occasional emergency cases, Dr. Guttmacher said. It would be fully equipped with one or two operating rooms, a laboratory and blood bank, 20 beds, an anesthetist and a rotat ing staff of obstetricians. Dr. Guttmacher said that a typical abortorium, as he en visaged it, could be self‐sup porting if one‐third of its pa tients were charged $150 to $200 and the remaining two‐ thirds were poor patients who would be aborted free of charge. The California study indi cates, he added, that an abor torium would be able to per form abortions in keeping with top medical standards. Dr. Margolis, who is an ob stetrician at the University of California, San Francico, said that all the outpatient abor tions at his institution were performed in the first trimester of pregnancy using a relatively new suction technique. This method, which employs a glass suction tube attached to a wa ter pump, is “safer, quicker and involves much less blood loss” than the standard uterine scrap ing, Dr. Margolis said. Resolution Approved In an unusual action for a physicians' organization, the membership of the American Association of Planned Parentrood Physicians unanimously approved today a resolution recommending that the medical profession make “easily avail able to all women” whatever aid they may need to prevent birth, including abortion. In endorsing the principle that a woman has the sole right to decide whether or not to bear children and that the decision to have an abortion is up to her and her physician, the resolution urged the medi cal profession to “abandon re strictive attitudes and unneces sary consultative procedures which currently inhibit the full and efficient implementation of this principle.” The resolution also urged the “abolition of all statutes and criminal laws which in any way restrict the performance of abortion by licensed physi cians.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Catholic Bishops Assail Abortion Bill,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/11/archives/catholic-bishops-assail-abortion-bill.html,"Cardinal Cooke called pas sage of the abortion bill in Albany yeterday a “threat to our state and our country” and a “direct attack on the sanctity of human life and the welfare of our society.” In a statement issued on be half of the New York State Bishops immediately after the Senate had passed the bill, the Cardinal said: “Notwithstand ing the passage of this bill, we urge all our fellow citizens to reverence and preserve unborn human life. We call upon the Governor to veto this bill.” Passage of the bill by the Legislature came after the Archdiocese of New York con ducted a long and active cam paign to retain the old law which was enacted in 1830. Msgr. Thomas J. McGovern, spokesman for the archdiocese, said that it would now be left to individual pastors to de cide whether or not to speak on the subject of abortion from the pulpit. A spot check of priests, however, did not re veal any who were planning abortion tomorrow. ‘Already Know About It’ “The people already know the evils of abortion because we have talked about it very clearly in these past Sundays,” said Msgr. Mario J. Ponsiglione, pastor of the St. Theresa of the Infant Jesus Church 2855 St. Theresa Avenue, the Bronx. “They already know all about it, so there's no sense in saying any more about it.” Roman Catholic hospitals in the archdiocese will not per form abortions, Monsignor Mc Govern said, because “even though the State of New York has changed its law, it does not mean that God has changed His law.” In hospitals throughout the city, many gynecologists and obstetricians were faced with a dilemma with passage of the bill. Some Catholic doctors said they would not perform abortions because of their reli gious beliefs, and some other doctors said they had simply not made up their minds. “It's not a question that can answer yes or no,” said Dr. Gideon Panter of 653 Park Ave nue, a gynecologist and obste trician. “Often abortion is not the best solution for a patient. The real question that I ask myself is whether an abortion will help or hurt a patient in the long run.” He said that while abortion was often the “obvious easy way out.” it was not always the answer to a particular problem. He said that some women had a “basic subcon scious need” to P, et pregnant and that some of these women had committed suicide on the an niversary of their abortion. According to the American Medical Association, a doctor can legally refuse to perform an abortion. But many doctors who said they were willing to perform abortions expressed doubts that there would be enough available space in hos pitals. It is estimated that 50, 000 to 100,000 women in New York City will seek abortions every year. Most successful specialists have their hangs full with their own patients,” said Dr. Martin Kurman, a gynecologist and obstetrician, “We are put in difficult position. Just because we agree with the bill doesn't mean we can handle the cases. “The horror of it is that abortions have only been dis cussed as a legal issue. Nobody has said, ‘Let's do a study on this thing as far as treatment is concerned.’” When Does Life Begin? In addtion to Catholic doc tors, there were other Catho lics who were not certain about their reaction to passage of the bill. On the whole, however, the moral issue of abortion is one on which most Catholics are believed to support the of ficial position of the church, no matter how much they may dis agree on such issues as birth control and priests' celibacy. The church says that human life begins at the point of con ception and that any willful termination constitutes murder. Some theologians, however, hold that it is not certain at which point human life begins. Others hold that there may be cases—such as pregnancies re sulting from rape or incest— where an abortion should be left to the individual conscience. “These theologians speak of the fetus as an aggressor threatening the life of the mother,” says Daniel Callahan, a former editor of Common weal, a Catholic weekly, and author of the forthcoming book, “Abortion: Law, Choice and Morality.” Another mixed reaction to the bill came from the editors of Commonweal, who issued statement on the bill yester day. “We are very disturbed by certain aspects of the recent change in the New York law,” the statement said. “Scientists warn that we will soon be faced with a host of crucial ‘life‐control’ problems posed by advances in biology and medi cine. The abortion debate marks the beginning of that confron tation—and a very inauspicious beginning.” In the same vein, Monsignor McGovern expressed misgivings that passage of the abortion bill would open “a tremen dous roadway” for the legaliza tion of sterilization, compulsory abortion and euthanasia. “The same logic that passed this bill will be the same that would cause passage of the Dthers,” he said. “They don't know what they've accepted.” COOKE'S STATEMENT Following is the statement of Cardinal Cooke on behalf of the New York State bishops: We are deeply saddened that the Legislature of our state has passed a bill modi fying the state law on abor tion. This bill is a direct at tack on the sanctity of hu man life and the welfare of our society. Our founding fathers predi cated the establishment of this nation upon a recogni tion of certain inalienable rights received from our cre ator and specifically included among them the right to life. The action taken by a ma jority of the Legislature is a rejection of this fundamental right to life and a threat to our state and our country. Abortion brings to an end with irreversible finality the life and destiny of the unborn child. All life comes from God and it is God himself who confers upon men the sublime ministry of safe guarding and preserving life from the initial moment of existence. We expressly reaffirm the sanctity of all human life, either born or unborn, and we firmly reject the contrary principles which underly this abortion bill. Notwithstanding the pas sage of this bill, we urge all our fellow citizens to revere and preserve unborn human life. We call upon the Gover nor to veto this bill. We hope our society will always be on the side of life and protective of the human person.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CAMPUS DISORDER IS TARGET OF BILL,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/11/archives/campus-disorder-is-target-of-bill-the-mandatory-suspension-of.html,"ALBANY, April 10 — The Assembly, in a waspish session that haggled on late into the evening, today passed a bill requiring colleges that receive state funds to suspend students convicted of offenses commit ted on campus. While the Senate was acting on the measure to liberalize the state's abortion law, the As sembly, with legislators drifting in and out of the chamber, de voted itself to a lengthy calen dar as part of its push toward a hoped‐for adjournment by the end of next week. Further evidence that the an nual frenzy that attends the end of each session was well underway were the complaints by lawmakers about votes be ing cast in the names of absent legislators and a tendency to marshal legislation through at a rapid pace that was some times ground to a halt by de bates that contained unusually large measures of bickering. Numerous legislators, irked by what they considered a per sonally insulting remark from a colleague would rise on points of “high personal privilege” to voice their displeasure. Sponsored by Hausbeck The bill concerning campus offenses was sponsored by As semblyman Albert J. Hausbeck, a Democrat from Buffalo, a city that has been the scene recent ly of student turmoil on the campus of the State University there. The bill, which passed by a vote of 95 to 43 and now goes to the Senate, provides for sus pensions from college of stu dents for up to five years, de pending upon the penalty im posed upton them when they were convicted in court. A student given 10 days in jail would be suspended for a year, sentenced up to a month would be barred from a state‐aided campus for three years, and a student sent to jail for up to three months would be suspended for five years. The bill also provides that if the penalty imposed by the court is “three months or more such student shall be barred fram any institution supported wholly or in part by state funds.” Mr. Hausbeck, who said he had signatures from 10,000 Buffalo residents supporting the bill, said its intent was to elimi nate students “trying to destroy the very institution they attend.” Colleges that did not suspend convicted students would risk losing their state assistances, Mr. Hausbeck said. Bill Called ‘Incredible’ “I have never seen anything as incredible—incredible as this bill,” said G. Oliver Koppell, a freshman Democrat from the Bronx. “Because a person may err at the time does not mean he cannot become a responsible citizen.” “Who is this lousy kid?” a voice on the Republican side was heard to say. Assemblyman Kenneth G. Bartlett; a Republican of Syra cuse and an educator, asked whether the bill did not consti tute “double jeopardy” since student would be penalized by both a court and a college. He voted against the bill. Assemblyman Arthur O. Eve, a Democrat from Buffalo, sum marized some of the criticism of the bill when he said: “You're going to make good students join with the radicals in oppos ing this kind of legislation.” Other Bills in House Other developments in the Assembly included the follow ing: JURY TRIAL After some debate, the As sembly passed and sent to the Senate a bill providing for jury trials in New York City for persons accused of misdemean ors. In the absence of the spon sor, Assemblyman Sidney A. Lichtman, a Brooklyn Demo crat who is hospitalized, As semblyman Joseph R. Pisani, a Republican from Westchester, presented the bill. The present system in the city is for a three‐judge panel to hear mis demeanors, with a guilty judg ment by two or three of them resulting in a conviction. Opponents of the bill argued that establishing a jury system of not less than six persons in such cases would clog already crowded court calendars. The jury system for misdemeanors is in effect throughout the rest of the state. The costs for the added staff and judges would be prohibi tive, the opponents argued, prompting Mr. Pisani to reply: “I don't care. Whatever we need we ought to have.” NEWSMEN'S PRIVILEGE A bill exempting journalists from contempt of court pro ceedings for refusing to divulge sources of information passed in the Assembly and was sent to the Senate. LIE DETECTOR TESTS The Assembly adopted a bill forbidding businesses from re quiring prospective employes to take lie detector tests. Viola tion of the law, which now goes to the Senate, could re sult in $1,000 fine and impris onment of up to 60‐days.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sociologists Differ on the Effects Of the Liberalized Abortion Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/12/archives/sociologists-differ-on-the-effects-of-the-liberalized-abortion-law.html,"Making abortion legal in New York solves a legal problem but raises substantial othe questions: will it improve the lot of women, the sanctity of marriage, the morality of citizens? The New York Times asked professors of sociology for their opinions, and got these diver gent views: DOROTHY SWAINE THOM AS, University of Pennsylvania —“From any viewpoint it's a good thing to relax the law and that's that. It's a good thing because the law is dis criminatory against women. And I can see no way in which repeal of a law barring abortion could destroy the fam ily or morality or religion see no harm at all, and I just do not agree that abortion means murder. “Abortion has been an ef fective means of controlling population growth in Japan, Hungary, and Eastern Euro pean countries generally. It's likely to decrease the rate of growth of population here as well.” • ROBERT NISBET, University of California, Riverside—“I am in favor of the utmost rational liberalization of our abortion laws, and that springs from my sociological mind as well as my human heart. “It seems to me to be the right of any rational woman to make the decision to terminate pregnancy so long as it can be done within medically sanc tioned circumstances.” • THE REV. JOSEPH P. FITZ PATRICK, Fordham University —“Abortion is primarily a mor al problem that centers around the issue of human life, namely at what moment is a human life present in the womb and, if a human life is present, does anyone have a right to de stroy it. “The problem in the sociolo gy of law arises when citizens no longer agree on the moral issue. If a majority of citizens; no longer accepts a moral code, is it wise policy to attempt to enforce that moral code by law?” “This is not a problem of morality: might does not make right; neither does a majority vote. Rather it is a problem of political wisdom: should a state seek to use the law to support a form of behavior which a majority does not con sider morally binding: “The decision of the New York State Legislature indi cates that the consensus of opinion necessary to support a law is no longer present in the case of abortion legislation. “Widespread violation of law is not in itself a reasonable ground for doing away with the law. But evidence of a loss ofd consensus does raise the ques tion whether the law can rea sonably be continued. “Certainly the number of re corded abortions will rise sharply when the law is re laxed. Does this mean there are more abortions in fact than there were when abortions were illegal and clandestine? It is hard to say, but I rather think there will be. “The social effects of legal izing abortion will be judged to be good or bad largely in terms of the way one judges social developments in a frame work of one's moral values. In the framework of my own val ues, the legalizing of abortion is another indication of a loss of sensitivity around the basic issue of human life about which I cannot be optimistic.” • MELVIN M. TUMIN, Prince ton University—“Abortion is one of those cases in which we vote one set of morals against another. “Judging by what's happened in the past with contraception, I suspect there will be signifi cant use of the new liberty by all religious groups—including Catholics. “Hopefully the new freedom will cut out the black market in dangerous abortions. It will save untold numbers of young men and women months of fear while they try to arrange an abortion. It will create a much healthier atmosphere for the bearing of children as an act of will, and will eliminate that horror called the accidental child.” • MORRIS JANOWITZ, Uni versity of Chicago—“Abortion is indispensable for any ration al and humane form of popu lation control. “What is striking is that the United States is so late in com ing to abortion. Population ex perts here misled the country. They believed population growth could be controlled without abortion, and special ists in social sciences and poli cy made a decision to avoid pressing for abortion. The clam or in favor of abortion did not come from technical experts: it came from a popular movement.” • JOHN E. HUGHES, Villanova University—“I don't think the legalization of abortion will make a lot of difference in family life. Abortion is not step taken lightly—legally or illegally. “For unmarried mothers it might be the lesser of two evils, and I don't think it's a catastrophe to legalize abor tion. Certainly there are situ ations in which it's medically or psychologically indicated.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"New York, N.Y.",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/12/archives/new-york-ny-these-two-parties-could-make-all-the-difference.html,"In 1941, two labor leaders David Duhinskv of the Inter national Ladies Garment Work ers Union and Alex Rose of the United Hatters, Cap and Milli nery Workers—dropped out of the American Labor party with an attack on Communist infiltra tion of the eight‐year‐old party. In 1962, two young Republi can lawyers — brothers‐in‐law named Kieran O'Doherty and J. Daniel Mahoney — were so outraged by the liberal records of Governor Rockefeller and Senator Jacob K. Javits that they decided to form their own party. And New York politics has never been the same. For 25 years, the Liberal party, organized by Mr. Rose and Mr. Dubinsky, has influ enced Democratic nominations and, in fact, represented the only organized support of the winning candidate for Mayor, John V. Lindsay last year. In eight years, the Conservative party, put together by Mr. O'Doherty and Mr. Mahoney, has grown to the point of hav ing some hope this year of elect ing a United States Senator. The two “third” parties are strictly New York operations, although both have endorsed Presidential candidates — the Liberals backing Democrats and the Conservatives backing Re publicans. Both parties have little more than 100,000 en rolled members in a state with almost 7 million voters, but both could have enormous influence on the 1970 state elections, and they began trying to exercise that influence last week. ¶The Liberal State Committee met on Saturday to designate two of the party's most promi nent members—Rev. Donald S. Harrington, the party's state chairman, for Governor and Deputy Mayor Timothy W. Cos tello for United States Senator. Both were regarded as “stand in” candidates—that is, they could withdraw at any time be fore May 12 and the party could endorse two other men, perhaps Arthur J. Goldberg, a Democrat, for Governor, and Senator Charles E. Goodell, a Republi can, for the Senate. Part of the party's power this year—power that is invariably exercised by Mr. Rose as the dominant Lib eral figure—is that if Mr. Har rington does not step aside, Mr. Goldberg could he in trouble in November even if he wins the June 23 Democratic primary*election. ¶The Conservative State Com mittee met on Tuesday to des ignate the party's two best past vote‐getters—Paul L. Adams for Governor and James L. Buckley for Senator. They are not stand ins and Mr. Buckley, who re ceived 1,139,402 votes in the three ‐ way 1968 Senate race with Mr. Javits and Democrat Paul O'Dwyer, will probably he a major factor this year. As the “conservative alternative,” he hopes to double his 1968 vote in a race against Mr. Goodell, liberal Republican, and against the winner among the four lib erals running in the Democratic Senate primary. Peak of Power The Liberal and trnnservative parties do battle this year at the peak of their power. Mayor Lindsay collected 844,023 votes on the Liberal line last year after losing the Republican pri mary to John J. Marchi, who was also the Conservative candidate, and the Mayor has rewarded Mr. Rose with patronage power that almost exceeds his ability to produce jobholders. The Con servatives were also a major factor in the mayoral election and two years earlier had won “Row C” on the state ballot when Mr. Adams polled 510,023 votes for Governor to 507,234 for the Liberal candidate, Frank‐*lin D. Roosevelt Jr. The candidacy of Mr. Roose velt, a Democrat, however, pointed up the “balance of pow er” game played by both par ties. In 1966, Governor Rocke feller defeated the Democratic candidate, Frank D, O'Connor by 392,263 votes, so if the Lib eral votes came from Demo crats, Mr. Roosevelt was a clas sic “spoiler candidate.” Since the 1966 election, Mr. Rose has sometimes been charged with wanting to help re‐elect Mr. Rockefeller and there would err tainly he similar charges this car if Mr. Harrington does not withdraw. But the Liberals might have other reasons for not back ing Mr. Goldberg—the minor parties have always polled more votes in the past with inde pendent candidates and the Lib erals would like to win enough votes to regain line “C”. The Liberal vote is won at Democratic expense, but there is some uncertainty about whether the Conservatives have the same impact on the Republicans. Many politicians believe that the ma jority of votes on the Conserva tive line are cast by Irish and Italian voters who are regis tered Democrats. The designation meetings of the two parties—nominating meetings actually because both parties prevent primary fights by refusing permission for Dem ocrats and Republicans to enter their primaries—were quiet af fairs engineered and managed by party leaders. In fact, after the chaos of the Democratic designating meeting at Grossinger's, it was a week for quiet conventions as Repub licans met in Rochester to des ignate Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Goodell, Lieut. Gov. Malcolm Wilson, Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz and Edward V. Re gan for Controller. The only ex citement in Rochester came at the last minute when the Gov ernor decided on Mr. Regan and the surprised candidate had to he flown in from a California business trip. —RICHARD REEVES Abortion Reform After Long Fight ALBANY—In 1966 a four‐year veteran of the New York State 4ssembly, Albert H. Blumenthal, Democrat of Manhattan, agreed Lo support a bill calling for re rorm of the state's 19th‐century abortion law and could muster Dnly 12 “persons to a public hearing. Abuse was immediate. He was denounced by the Catholic Church for “advocating the slaughter of innocents.” Few un derstood or supported the issue except men such as Percy Sutton —who originated the idea of a reform bill—who saw the costs of illegal abortions in lives and maimings in the ghettos. But they were riding the be ginnings of a swell of public sentiment that built rapidly and swept over the country in a few short years. Last week, New York joined the growing list of reform states with a new law that would allow abortions during the first 24 weeks of pregnancy when a wo man and her doctor agree one should he performed. Emotions ran high as the new law passed through the New York Legislature. The drama be gan on March 18 when, in surprise move, the Senate passed an even more liberal law than last week's version. It was nar rowly defeated in the Assembly. Then, last week the measure came up again in the Assembly. On Thursday came the crucial vote. After an emotion‐packed debate, the hill's supporters seamed certain that the measure would he defeated. At that stage, an upstate Democrat, George M. Michaels, of Auburn, his hand, trembling and tears welling in his eyes, stopped the voting. “I realize, Mr. Speaker,” he said, “that I am terminating my political career, but I cannot in good conscience sit here and al low my vote to be the one that defeats this bill—I ask that my vote be changed from ‘no’ to ‘yes.’” His face drained of color and his hands barely grasping the microphone, Mr. Michaels told of the fierce feelings within his own family over the bill. “My own son,” he sobbed, “my own son called me a whore for voting against this bill. And my other son begged me not to let my vote be the one that defeated the bill.” After Mr. Michaels switch, the measure passed the Assem bly, 76 to 73, and was sent to the Senate where after another teary, angry session it was ap proved, 31 to 26. Terence Car dinal Cooke, speaking for the state's Catholic bishops, imme diately called on Governor Rockefeller to veto the bill but the Governor signed it into law yesterday. The difference between 1966 and 1970 has been an amazing educational process. 19th Century Laws Abortion laws in the 50 states all dated from the 19th century, when medical knowledge and the desire for more people to fill the seemingly endless acres of vacant America demanded child birth. New York State, in fact, had the report of a study com mission in hand when its law was passed in 1828 (to become effective in 1830) that recom mended that no surgery be al lowed except “when necessary to save a life.” Fears of prim itive medical practices prompted the conclusion, though only abortions were eventually so re‐*strained. But now population pressures, limited resources, illegal abor tion butchery and the demand of women for more control of their own lives demanded change. These groups began to be heard and national drives were organ ized. By 1967, Colorado led the way with the first major reform Ten other states joined. Perhaps the key change per mitting the rapid development of sentiment for reform has been a general demise of old customs and concepts. In 1966, support ers report, few people could speak publicly about abortions without embarrassment. In the end the only intensive, persistent opposition was the Catholic Church, and even there the membership no longer seemed to support its leadership. One Senator, who reported strong pressure from the organized church to vote against the bill, reported that a poll showed 60 per cent of the membership of his church favored reform and would participate in an abortion act. The final pressure for change was added late last year when the courts began to respond to efforts begun in 1959 by the American Law Institute. A land mark decision handed clown by the Supreme Court of California in September, 1969, declared law similar to that of New York's a violation of the Federal Con stitution and that it infringed on a woman's rights to decide whether to risk childbirth and whether to hear child. The possibility that nullifica tion by the courts would leave states without regulation at all added the final impetus that seems destined to rewrite abor tion laws in every state. —BILL KOVACH",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Rockefeller, Signing Abortion Bill, Credits Women's Groups",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/12/archives/rockefeller-signing-abortion-bill-credits-womens-groups.html,"ALBANY, April 11 — Gover nor Rockefeller signed into law today the new abortion reform bill, adding New York to a growing list of states increas ing a woman's control over the medical termination of her pregnancy. The Governor signed the bill — which had dominated this session of the Legislature — without comment. Earlier, how ever, the Governor gave credit to women's groups who had lobbied intensively for the bill. “Women's liberation played an important part in the pas sage of this bill,” the Governor told newsmen in New York City before traveling here to sign the measure. He also said that “the wives of the Senate and the Assemby put this bill through.” The Governor also credited. the Republican party for pas sage of the measure. Politics, in fact, played an important role in passage, even though the majority of the opposition to the bill came from Republi cans in both houses. In a key political decision that made passage possible As semblyman Albert H. Blumen thal, Democrat of Manhattan, who has pioneered the reform effort in the state, was re moved as sponsor of the bill this year. Legislative leadership, in Republican hands in both houses, would agree to passing a bill this year only if it had Republican sponsorship. Under the new law a woman and her doctor may decide to terminate a pregnancy for any reason at any time up to the 24th week of pregnancy. After that time an abortion may be performed only to save the woman's life. Under the old law, passed in 1830, an abortion was permis sible only to save a woman's life. Today legislators introduced amendments designed to fur ther restrict the application of the new law, which becomes effective July 1. Their actions today included the following: ¶Assemblyman Willis H. Ste phens, Republican of Brewster, introduced an amendment that would restrict abortions on de mand to the first 15 weeks of pregnancy and require the writ ten consent of the woman or, in the case of a minor, her parent or guardian. The amend ment further would provide that abortions could only be performed in a hospital or clinic approved by the State Health Department. ¶Amendments were intro duced by other Assemblymen to free from charges of mal practice any doctor or hospital who refused to perform an abortion because of personal convictions. ¶A separate bill was intro duced in the Senate by the most vocal opponent of reform in that chamber, Senator James H. Donovan, Oneida County Republican. Mr. Donovan's bill would forbid the expenditure of any public funds for abor tions. At least one of the amend ments—the one relieving doc tors and hospitals of any re quirement forcing them to per form abortions—is expected to come to a vote next week and has substantial support in both houses. Support for the other measures has yet to solidify, and both amendments could be lost in the final week's rush toward adjournment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VIRGINIA ADOPTS ABORTION REFORM,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/12/archives/virginia-adopts-abortion-reform-mental-or-physical-health-of-mother.html,"RICHMOND, April 11 —Ef fective June 26, Virginia will hay e a new and Liberalized abortion law, approved by this year's session of the state's Legislature and signed this week by Gov. Lynwood Holton. The new law, the latest in a series of abortion reforms thtroughout the nation, will allow therapeutic abortions if continuation of pregnancy “is likely to result in the death of the woman or substantially impair the mental or physical health of the woman.” It also permits abortions if pregnancy resulted from rape or incest. The law replaces a 123‐year‐ old law that allowed abortion only if the life of the mother was endangered by continued pregnancy. A Three‐Doctor Panel To have an abortion per formed, a woman must swear under the new law that she has been a resident of Virginia for 120 days. The original bill pro vided for six months' residen cy. An amendment reduced the residency requirement to 30 days, and the 120‐day compro mise was recahed before final passage. Another requirement is that abortions must be performed in a certified hospital. A gyne cologist or obstetrician must be a member of the three‐doctor Ipaned that will decide whether a request for an abortion will be granted. The abortion re lquest can be granted by a ma jority vote of the three‐doctor board. A doctor will have the right to refuse to serve on an abor tion board. Likewise, hospitals may refuse to have abortions performed within their facilites. At testimony preceding pas sage of the bill, it was estimated that 20,000 illegal abortions were performed each year in Virginia. Dr. H. Hudnall Ware Jr., of the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond, urged adoption of the revised law to reduce that estimated number of illegal abortions. The Virginia Society for the Preservation of Human Life, Roman Catholic‐oriented or ganization, argued during hear ings against adoption of the liberalized bill. Other states where abortion liberalization has been ap proved by some governmental body recently include Hawaii, where the new law is already in effect; Maryland, Wisconsin and New York.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Flaws in Abortion Reform Found in an 8‐State Study,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/13/archives/flaws-in-abortion-reform-found-in-an-8state-study-flaws-in-abortion.html,"Serious shortcomings are be coming apparent in many of the liberalized state abortion laws, despite a clear nation wide trend toward abortion re form.  The debate over the applica tion and effectiveness of the revised laws is growing as a result, and pressure for the re peal of all restrictions on abor tions is being generated in some states, particularly those in which some reforms have already been passed. Interviews with legislators, physicians and hospital offi cials last week in eight states where some reforms have been passed indicated the following ¶Despite reforms, the laws are not reaching the poor, who cannot afford the abortions or the psychiatric consultations that are often necessary to get them. ¶While the number of legal abortions has risen sharply where reforms have been insti tuted, thousands of illegal abor tions are still performed, in part because of remaining legal restrictions, red tape and the reluctance of some doctors and hospitals to participate. ¶Many doctors in the af fected states are still uncertain of their liabilities under the new laws. ¶Where reforms have been passed, the debate over the moral issues of abortion ap pears to be fading, and con troversy over the complexities and shortcomings of the new laws is increasing. Since 1967, when Colorado became the first state to pass abortion reforms, 13 states have liberalized their abortion laws, and courts in several states have held abortion statutes un constitutional. Hawaii and New York have passed the most liberal ver sions. Hawaii's went into effect last month, and New York's, signed into law Saturday by Governor Rockefeller, becomes effective on July 1. The latter permits abortions for any rea son within 24 weeks of concep tion. Eleven states — Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Kansas, Maryland, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon and South Carolina— have reform statutes similar to a model code proposed by the American Law Institute. Their laws generally permit abortions to protect the physi cal or mental health of the woman, in pregnancies caused by rape or incest and when there is a possibility of de formity or mental defects in the child. Most of the states have time limits for legal abor tions, and some have residence requirements. In an interview, the chief sponsor of Colorado's reform law, State Representative Rich ard Lamm, appeared to sum marize the feelings of many critics. ‘Isn't Good Enough’ The Colorado abortion reform law “just isn't good enough,” he said. “We tried to change a cruel, outmoded, inhuman law —and what we got was a cruel, outmoded, inhuman law,” he said. “We still force women either to have a baby or to have an illegal abortion.” Mr. Lamm estimated that 19 out of every 20 women who seek a legal abortion in Colo rado are refused because they do not meet the legislated cri teria covering the health of the woman or child and cases of rape or incest. Legal abortions in Colorado rose from 497 in 1968, the first full year of the law's operation, to 946 last year. In two‐thirds of the cases, the reason for the abortion was that the woman's mental helath was threatened. Dr. William Goddard, a Den ver obstetrician and gynecolo gist who has filed a suit asking that Colorado's abortion law be declared unconstitutional, said that the present statute was hard, if not impossible, to ad minister. In most states where reforms have been passed, critics of the new laws say that they dis criminate against the poor. The cost of a legal abortion is more than $500 in Colorado, averages $600 in California and is as high as $1,100 at one Cali fornia hospital. It costs $400 to $500 in Ore gon, with a $250 deposit re quired by many hospitals. “It is obvious that poor people can not get an abortion in Oregon,” said Dr. Robert I. Daugherty, a member of the State Board of Health. The number of legal abor tions has risen sharply instates with reformed laws, but illegal abortion operations continue to flourish. In California, where reform laws have been in ef fect for nearly three years, about 80,000 illegal abortions are performed annually. There were only 14,000 legal abortions in California last year. In New Mexico, where a reform bill went into effect last June, women seeking abortions still go to Juarez, Mexico, just across the border, to get them. A reform law passed by the Georgia Legislature last year has had little practical effect, according to officials and doc tors, who say that there has been no significant increase in legal abortions, largely because of the statute's complexities. Those complexities have made many doctors cautious about performing abortions, particu larly because of uncertainties over their own liabilities. Dr. J. Oppie McCall Jr., a past medical director of Planned Parenthood in Portland, Ore., says that only 25 per cent of Portland's 80 gynecologists will perform abortions and that four of the city's 18 hospitals refuse to allow them. Hospitals in a number of states, whose officials have ex pressed fears of becoming “abortion mills” besieged by out‐of‐state women, have set up abortion quotas and other limitations. A Denver gynecolo gist, who favors repeal of all abortion laws, said: “It is quite possible that to day it is more difficult in some instances to obtain a legal abortion than it was before the inception of the new law.” While public debate over the morality of abortions has all but vanished in states where reforms have been passed, many Catholic hospitals and doctors continue to refuse to perform them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Trudeau Beset by Old Problems,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/13/archives/trudeau-beset-by-old-problems.html,"OTTAWA, April 12 — Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau has reached the midpoint of his term of office still shaping a “Just Society” that he has not yet unveiled to public view. After 24 months the man whom a majority of the voters chose as the leader best quali fied to move Canada to new so cial frontiers finds himself grappling with problems of the old order. No sweeping reforms have emerged and Mr. Trudeau is be ing viewed here less as a vi sionary than as a disciplinarian teacher who became principal of the school. Some Ottawans speculate now on how radical Mr. Tru deau might have proved had Canada been confronted by some crisis—an economic de pression, a collapsed dollar, a war or a rebellion in French speaking Quebec. None of those emergencies developed, and ac cording to some of his aides, Mr. Trudeau has had time to think and plan. His four‐year schedule is on time, an associ ate said last week. At present the odd combina tion of inflation and rising un employment requires much of the Prime Minister's time and energy. To the surprise of many Mr. Trudeau, who has demon strated that he can be an origi nal and unorthodox thinker, is fighting inflation with such tried and, some say, worn weapons as tight money, high taxation and severe economies in government. In other areas of contention, he has advanced the cause of English‐French bilingualism, but in doing so he has neither pleased the English‐speaking West nor gratified French speaking Quebec. A generally cooling economy, coupled with the austerity pro gram, has delayed the develop ment of bold programs to blot out pockets of poverty, to build needed housing and to finance attractive public works. Overtures of friendship to Communist China have gone unheard. A glut of wheat on the prairies has produced only the unimaginative response long decried by Canadians—Ameri can‐style Government pay ments to farmers who promise not to grow more. Mr. Trudeau, a political late comer, became leader of the Liberal party two years ago in a remarkable tour de force and then on April 20, 1968, succeed ed Lester B. Pearson as Prime Minister. He called an election to overcome the minority han dicap in Parliament that had plagued Mr. Pearson's five‐year term. He campaigned with few promises but aroused public ex pectations with exciting phrases about the Just Society and “participatory democracy.” Behind him the Liberals won 154 seats, leaving only 100 to be split among four Opposition parties. Looking back, the fears ex pressed at the time seem odd: that Mr. Trudeau, the wealthy bachelor who fancies sports cars and the company of young actresses and who advocaved liberalizing the laws on abortion and homosexuality, would introduce radical social and economic reforms that tradi tionally conservative Canadians could not accept. He has spent two years put ting the government house in order and setting up good man agement. He has balanced the federal budget and gone on to build up a surplus of $500‐mil lion this year. Now he has at least two years to unfold blue prints for the new Canada. “The goodies,” as Marc La londe, the Prime Minister's pol icy adviser, explained to a cor respondent recently, will come by 1972. Mr. Trudeau's critics are less chagrined than his supporters. When Parliament returned from its Easter recess last week, Da vid Lewis, a long‐time spokes man of the leftish New Demo cratic party, said the time had come for the Prime Minister “to show what he has.” “He's had two years in of ice, he's at his midterm now, and we've had little but white papers,” Mr. Lewis told a re porter. The Prime Minister is widely congratulated for having achieved effective reform in the governmental process. He has tightened the operation of the Cabinet, making ministers strictly accountable for their departments and giving Cabinet committees power commensu rate wih responsibility. Long office hours are part of Mr. Trudeau's style but he does not try to shoulder all the bur den. Having decided on Good Friday on a new plan to resolve the wage dispute with postal truck drivers in Montreal, he went on a five‐day skiing holi day in British Columbia, having turned the negotiations over to a Cabinet minister. After a long debate last fall Commons bowed to proposed reforms in Parliament pro cedures. Now some Opposition leaders, while protesting what they term Mr. Trudeau's grab for power, concede that the rules have sped the legislative process. A deeper controversy turns on allegations that Mr. Tru deau's allocation of powers to task forces and to Liberal‐domi nated Commons committees erodes the parliamentary sys tem and moves Canada toward a republic in the American style. Furthermore, the Opposition asserts that Mr. Trudeau has more than doubled his own staff, while paring expenditures elsewhere. Since becoming Prime Minister he has increased his office force from fewer than 30 to 80, including 49 personal aides or other non‐civil service appointees. However, the Prime Minister has also been praised for devel oping a professional staff of in dependent advisers. Many politicians believe that the Government is vulnerable because the public cannot dis cern the reforms that have been the Prime Minister's principal work. Instead the voters see wheat and potash piling up un sold on the prairies and the economy lagging—even in in dustrially rich Ontario — with unemployment well above 6 per cent in some areas. The cost of living continues to rise while many men are laid off. Except for Mr. Trudeau's val iant efforts to prune the budg et—knocking out projects with the slightest taint of the pork barrel—his anti‐inflation fight strikes many as weak. He has obtained grudging agreements from individual businesses to delay price increases but he is openly defied by the labor unions. If Mr. Trudeau can somehow contain inflation through 1970, if he can keep employment from falling below present lev els and if the federal treasury holds onto its surpluses, then, many observers believe, he should be in a strong position to move ahead with the Just Society well ahead of the elec tion deadline (a Government's term is five years, but to wait for it to expire is often taken as a sign of weakness). The “ifs” are big, and when they are surmounted, the Prime Minister faces controversy in Parliament over the direction the reforms should take.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EGEBERG FAVORS AID FOR ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/13/archives/egeberg-favors-aid-for-abortion-would-use-public-funds-to-help.html,"The chief medical officer of the Department of Health, Edu cation and Welfare said yester day that he would be in favor of using public funds for as sisting indigent patients in ob taining abortions in states where they are legal.  Dr. Roger O. Egeberg, Assist ant Secretary for Health and Scientific Affairs, spoke in an swer to a question at a news conference before the opening of the sixth World Congress of Gynecology and Obstetrics at the Americana Hotel. He also said that recent Sen ate hearings on the dangers of the birth control pill “did more harm than good” by emphasiz ing what he said were the exag gerated dangers of the pill. On the subject of abortions, Dr. Egeberg said: “We have voted the right of health care to all people. They should have the same rights whether they can afford it or not. It becomes a health measure in many in stances.” Dr. Egeberg, who endorsed abortions several months ago as a “back‐up measure to birth control,” reaffirmed his support of abortion reform legislation such as the new New York State law. “I see abortion as a back‐up for when contraception; fails,” Dr. Egeberg told re porters. New York's abortion statute, signed into law last Saturday by Governor Rockefeller, per mits women over 21 to have abortions for any reason within 24 weeks of conception with the advice of their doctor. The law takes effect July 1. As for Federal or local gov ernment financing of abortions for the indigent, he said that he had not yet taken any steps along this line and that he would have to “do a lot of seri ous thinking” before proposing any particular measures. There is no provision in Federal health care statutes for finan cial assistance for abortions. Speaking on the Senate hear ings on the pill, Dr. Egeberg said he was disturbed that they emphasized the dangers of the pill without emphasizing the aangers of the alternatives. “The chances of death by clotting during pregnancy are six times as great as if you took the pill,” Dr. Egeberg said. “The chances of dying in child birth are seven times as great as if you took the pill.” Most Urgent Problems He said he would urge that a sentence be appended to a warning being placed in every package of birth control pills It would say: “If you intend to use the pill, you should know that if you do not use it and get pregnant that the chances of something happening to you are 13 times as great as if you used the pill.” In a speech delivered as the opening address before the Congress last night, Dr. Ege berg said that the “most urgent health problems in this coun try concern the delivery of health care.” “I cannot say with any cer tainty how many Americans are not receiving adequate health care,” he said. “Yet available data indicate that these poor Americans receive less health care than their more affluent neighbors.” He said that the health status of nonwhite Americans did not compare favorably with that of white Americans. While noting a considerable drop in the death rate at birth in the last 50 years, he said: “The fact remains that the wide discrepancy in this and other indicators of health and the delivery of health care show that the United States is a long way from providing what might be called adequate health care for the people of this country.” Although he declined to make any particular recom mendations for solutions, Dr. Egeberg concluded that “it is certain that changes will have to be made in the ways health care is delivered in this coun try.” As many as 6,000 doctors, in cluding 2,000 foreign physicians and medical specialists from 65 countries, are expected to at tend the World Congress, which will continue through Saturday.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ABORTION GUIDELINES URGED IN MARYLAND,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/15/archives/abortion-guidelines-urged-in-maryland.html,"BALTIMORE, April 14— The Medical and Chirurgical Facul ty, Maryland's equivalent of a medical society, is preparing to establish guidelines that would restrict legal abortions to the first 20 weeks of a woman's pregnancy. Before approving the regula tion, the faculty is waiting to see if Gov. Marvin Mandel signs a bill repealing Mary land's two‐year‐old abortion law. The repealer would per mit a woman and her physician to decide when and whether a pregnancy should be term inated.

BIRTH DEFECT CLUE SOUGHT IN FETUSES,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/15/archives/birth-defect-clue-sought-in-fetuses-canadians-studying-tissue-after.html,"ATLANTIC CITY, April 14 — A geneticist said today that he and other doctors in Canada were seeking to detect from the tissue of naturally aborted fetuses the cause of some con genital abnormalities, or birth defects.  The geneticist, Dr. David H. Carr of McMaster Univer sity in Hamilton, Ont., spoke at a symposium of the Federa tion of American Societies for Experimental Biology here. Doctors know that nature spontaneously aborts many fetuses with congenital abnor malities. Doctors recognize that, for unknown reasons, congenital abnormalities vary in incidence from region to region. For ex ample? Dr. Carr said in an interview that anencephaly, or lack of a brain, is a common congenital defect in North Ire land, South Wales and Egypt. The defect islethal. Mothers may carry such anencephalic children to term, or they may spontaneously abort these ab normal fetuses at any time during pregnancy. From studies done in hos pitals, doctors also know that fetuses of about 20 per cent of spontaneous abortions have a chromosomal abnormality. Chromosomes are bundles of hereditary information. Chromo somal abnormalities are known to be associated with certain diseases, one of which is Mongolism, or Down's syndrome. Scientists do not know how such chromosomal abnormali ties cause these defects. Not all congenital defects, however, are caused by chrom osomal abnormalities. Pathoingists examine the tis sues of abortions in hospitals. Generally, these doctors pre serve these fetuses, as they do other tissues, for varying pe riods of time. The study that Dr. Carr de scribed here uses such patho logic information to correlate the incidence of particular de fects with factors in the par ents' environment. Such a study, Dr. Carr said, has two purposes. One purpose is to deterrmine how such de fects correlate with the results of succeeding pregnancies in the same woman. Such studies, Dr. Carr said, have not pre viously been conducted. The other purpose is to gain clues about possible causes of birth defects by correlating in formation of factors such as age, cigarette smoking habits, occupation, use of medications and recent infections in both parents. Collecting such information from individuals retrospectively can be unreliable because they may forget what medicine or mild infection they used or ex perienced several weeks earlier. Accordingly, Dr. Carr said he hoped to use information from the Canadian Food and Drug Directorate on the local sale of medications and from health officials on the incidence of viral diseases. If, for example, three to five months after sales of a drug in creased or an outbreak of a viral disease occurred, the number of abortions from one type of congenital defect rose, then the doctors would further examine this clue by looking for evidence of the same rela tionship elsewhere. At McMaster, Dr. Carr said he could study just 200 fetuses each year and that it would take many years before this type of inexpensive “service re search pays off.” Cooperative studies else where could demonstrate re gional differences affording ad ditional clues to birth defects, Dr. Carr said. Doctors at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Dr. Carr said, are conducting a similar study.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 3 Nations With Legal Abortion, Debate Goes On",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/15/archives/in-3-nations-with-legal-abortion-debate-goes-on.html,"Liberal abortion laws in Ja pan, Sweden and Britain are working well in the opinion of their supporters — and much too well in the opinion of their critics. In all three countries debate over the long‐term effects of legalized abortions continues to preoccupy doctors, legis lators and public health offi cials, according to reports from correspondents of The New York Times in Tokyo, Stockholm and London. An, examination of the for eign laws, following the adop tion of sweeping abortion re form legislation by New York State last weekend, indicates that in each of the three coun tries the controversy has tak en a different turn. In Japan, abortions were le galized more than 20 years ago when overpopulation was an ominous threat. Today, with one of the world's lowest birth rates, Japan has a labor short age, and critics contend that legalized abortions are partly to blame. Moral Issue in Sweden Sweden's five‐year‐old abor tion reform law has generated debate primarily on ethical and moral questions raised by re ligious institutions — debate similar to that heard in State Legislatures in the United States where rigid abortion statutes have been challenged. In Britain, the influx of wom en from other countries seek ing abortions — estimated at 4,000 annually — has been at issue since Parliament passed a relaxed law two years ago. Some critics, who had charged that Britain was becoming the “abortion center” of the West, were thus encouraged by pass age of the New York reforms, which Governor Rockefeller signed into law Saturday. The New York law, which goes into effect next July 1, makes an abortion a matter be tween a woman and her doctor up to the 24th week of preg nancy. It is more liberal than the laws in Britain or Sweden, which allow an abortion only after two doctors certify that, a continued pregnancy would endanger the life, or physical or mental health of a woman. Japan's statute is the most liberal, permitting an abortion not only for the preservation of a woman's physical or mental health, but also by certifica tion that a family cannot afford to raise a child. Exclusion of Poor A major criticism of reforms passed in the United States has been the effective exclusion of the poor, with no provisions for Government subsidies or limitations on the high costs of abortions. In Japan, the cost of a legal abortion ranges from $30 to $50; in Sweden, abortions are performed for $1.20 by Govern ment‐employed doctors, and in Britain, they are performed for $500 for those who can afford it and free under the National Health Service. The growth of private health clinics for abortions has stirred the most recent controversy in Britain. The highly profitable clinics accounted for 20,863 of the 54,013 legal abortions re corded in Britain last year. The critics contend that the clinics amount to “abortion mills,” in which medical care is secondary to profit, and they are calling for legislation to tighten standards. “This is something New York had better watch out for.” said one opponent of abortion reform in London. “The med ical racketeers will probably blossom there just as they have in this country.” Experts on the British law say that, after two years, it is still too early to determine the impact of legalized abortions on family life or sexual mores. In Japan, however, critics say that 20 years of legalized abortions have contributed to an increasingly permissive sex ual climate and the erosion of the old family structure. These accusations are vigorously de nied by supporters of the law. “This decline in morality is a tendency that is found throughout the world, since World War II,” said Dr. Hideo Tsuboi, of Japan's Doctors As sociation for the Protection of Maternal Health. Dr. Tsuboi also disputed the claim that legal abortions have seriously contributed to the de clining number of young work ers entering Japan's labor force. Birth Rate Declines Japan's legal abortions— which numbered more than a million a year from 1955 to 1962 and remain at about 700, 000 a year now—and the in creased use of contraceptive drugs and devices have cut the Japanese birth rate today to 18.4 per 1,000 persons, one of the world's lowest rates. Family planning advocates dispute the claim that popula tion control programs have gone too far in Japan, but a growing number of economists are expressing concern over the low birth rate. Last year, Premier Eisaku Sato said his Government would encourage the reversal of Japan's declining birth rate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CHURCH‐PUPIL AID VOTED IN ALBANY,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/18/archives/churchpupil-aid-voted-in-albany-28million-is-appropriated-governor.html,"ALBANY, April 17 — The State Legislature approved state aid of $28‐million for non public schools today, with pro ponents hailing it as a major, but small step, toward saving the troubled private system. Opponents or the measure warned that the aid was being extended to these schools at the expense of public schools. But the counterargument was that if the private and parochial schools closed for lack of funds, the public system would be left with chaotic crowding. “It's the small step forward that keeps the schools viable,” Senate Majority Leader Earl W. Brydges said shortly before his chamber voted approval by 46 to 9. The measure was ap proved earlier in the Assembly, 125 to 21. Governor Rockefeller has en dorsed the concept of aid to non‐public schools and is ex pected to sign the measure. Opponents contended that the bill would violate the con stitutional ban against direct aid to nonpublic schools. But supporters said the measure was carefully worded to meet the permissible standard of aid for “examination and inspec tion” expenses. That is the language con tained in Article II, Section 3 of the State Constitution. The article, known as the Blaine Amendment, would be repealed under a proposed constitutional amendment approved this ses sion by the Legislature. If the repeal is approved by next year's legislature and the voters in a referendum, broader forms of aid would be permitted. ‘Nothing Unique’ The debate today was rela tively free of emotion, in com parison with earlier issues such as abortion reform. And while opponents of the school aid argued that it would encourage divisiveness in society, propo nents said that more than $40‐ million in state aid already is paid to sectarian schools for such items as textbooks and transportation. “This is nothing unique,” Al fred D. Lerner, Republican of Queens, told the chamber. “It's not a giant step for dismember ment.” But Albert H. Blumenthal, Democrat of Manhattan, dis puted this, arguing that the bill goes beyond the issue of church‐operated schools and would encourage a flight from public schools and even the establishment of new nonpublic systems — “hundreds of little hegemonies of separate and, perhaps, equal schools.” Another supporter, Raymond Skuse, Republican of Albany, said that the size of the aid was so small that no one would rush out to start a costly school system. Guy R. Brewer, Democrat of Queens, expressed concern that the bill could be used to sub sidize all‐white schools. Mr. Skuse replied that while the measure did not specifically prohibit this, “all children are admitted” to the sectarian schools. The $28‐million in aid would go to 850,000 students, 85 per cent of whom are in parochial schools, mainly the Roman Catholic Church's. The bill pro vides the aid for “examination and inspection” data‐keeping, and disclaims “the making of any payment under this act for religious worship or instruc tion.” The measure was endorsed today by the Board of Regents iri a 10‐to‐4 vote. At the same time, it was opposed as a drain on education funds needed by the public schools in state ments issued by the United Federation of Teachers, which is the city's teachers union, and by the Committee for Public Education and Religious Liber ty, a coalition of groups which said a lawsuit was under con sideration. In a statement this evening, the Most Rev. Francis J. Mugavero, Roman Catholic Bishop of Brooklyn, said he was disappointed that the Legislature was approving “a token response to a very real crisis,” in which parochial school costs and tuition had risen sharply.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Liberalized Abortion Vetoed in Alaska,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/19/archives/liberalized-abortion-vetoed-in-alaska.html,"JUNEAU, Alaska, April 18 (AP) — Gov. Keith Miller, de claring his decision a matter of “the Tight to life,” has vetoed legislation that would have given Alaska an abortion law almost without restrictions. State Senator John Rader, the Anchorage Democrat who sponsored the bill, said Gover nor Miller's decision showed “a lack of sensitivity and under standing of the bisic issues in volved.” He added that the leg islature could be one vote away from overturning the veto. Governor Miller, a Methodist, made three points in explain ing his veto. The central issue is the right to life,” the Republican Gover nor said. “If we can reason that we must leave no stone unturned to protect the inno cence of a person indicted for a crime or the rights of a con victed criminal, how then can we remove the protection of the law from the most innocent and defenseless form of human life?” He said he disagreed with those who said he should not allow his personal conviction to sway his decision. “Any man who does not follow his per sonal convictions in conducting state business is not worthy of the office of Governor,” he said. Third Objection He based his third objection on what he said were serious legal deficiencies in the bill. The act, passed last week by both houses of the legislature, would have allowed abortions to be a matter between the mother and her doctor while the fetus was incapable of sus taining life independent of the mother. This generally is con sidered to be until the 26th week of pregnancy. Governor Miller said that if the measure became law, no Alaska statute would make it a criminal offense to abort a viable or independent fetus. Mr. Rader noted that the bill had obtained 37 votes in the legislature. It would take two‐ thirds of the legislators — 40 votes—to override the veto. Mr. Rader said he thought two members of the legislature who were absent during the voting favored the measure. If he is right and the other supporters stand firm, one vote would de termine the bill's fate. The Senate's President, Brad Phillips, an Anchorage Repub lican, sent a message to the House immediately after the veto announcement suggesting that the 40‐seat Senate meet in joint session Wednesday to con sider the veto.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Old Political Game,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/21/archives/the-old-political-game-electionyear-concerns-said-to-sway-decisions.html,"ALBANY, April 20—It is fact as old as elective politics that the voices of individual voters and pressure groups are never heard so clearly as they are in an election year. The 1970 session of the New York State Legislature reconfirmed that fact and proved that if there is a “new politics” functioning in this state, it is strangely like the old. The session took some surpris ing twists and turns, and the gen eral conclusion here is that no one could have predicted, when it convened in January, the character of legislation it would enact, But, looking back on the session, many observers here can see that the upcoming elec tion, in which both the Gov ernor's job and continued Re publican control of the Legisla ture are at issue, determined the final vote on many major issues. News Analysis Legislative control, now hang ing by a delicate six‐vote margin in the Assembly, is es pecially important this year be cause the next elected Legisla ture will reapportion election districts throughout the state on the basis of the 1970 Census. This will determine the political tint of the state for a decade to come. Spending Without Taxes From opening day, when the Governor announced his pro gram to the Legislature, politi cal considerations appeared to move to the fore. Resting on the fiscal cushion fashioned from cuts in the rate of state spending for education, welfare and health in 1969 (a nonelec tion year), the Governor could announce increased statespend ing “without any new taxes.” In the end he raised spending $800‐million over last year's total in a $7.2‐billion budget that provided $388‐million more in state aid to education than would have been possible under the cutbacks voted in 1969. The intense bitterness of the education lobby in 1969 was muted. To many here for the entire session, there was only one, fleeting moment when it seemed that an impolitic move was under consideration. That was the move to reform the abor tion laws. But on closer exami nation, a number of legislators agree, everything was done to make the move one Of definite political advantage that caused real problems only for liberal Democrats. Liberals Feel the Pinch This magic was worked by a major compromise that some legislators say was real, even though it was never coldly negotiated as a compromise. The arch enemy of abortion re form has been the Catholic Church, but, these legislators say, it fought repeal with a vigor diluted by the fact that the Legislature was considering at the same time two other matters striking close to the roots of the church's organi zation: direct state financial aid to nonpublic schools, to the tune of $28‐million this year, and a first step toward repeal of the constitutional amend ment that bars state aid for such directly. In the end, only liberals, who by conviction were forced to vote both for abortion reform and against state aid to non public schools, say that they were deeply wounded politi cally. The majority Republi can party and the Governor could win support for their efforts both from femininists and Catholics. The majority party had also taken care to see that this year's successful abortion bill was sponsored by a Republi can, though for the proceeding four years of pioneering work, Albert M. Blumenthall a lonely Democrat, had carried the bill and paved the way to final passage. As in restoration of funds for education, the session was in many ways a repeal of 1969. Welfare payments were in creased by 10 per cent, which generally restored them to lev els attained before the 1969 cutbacks. New issues and constituen cies were also addressed when the Republican‐controlled Leg islature put itself on record as favoring voting by 18‐year olds and the development of an en vironmental program. The Democrats complained throughout the session that they were being forced to vote on bills that provided “some relief” or made laws “better than they are now,” but that fell short of hoped‐for improve ments. Time after time, a Dem ocrat would rise to denounce a bill, only to cast a vote in favor because it would have been po litical suicide to do otherwise. Half‐a‐Loaf Measures In this category were the fol lowing: consumer affairs bills to establish a board to super vise such matters (Democrats, wanted an independent agen cy); tax reform that established a minimum income tax to reach the very wealthy (not nearly enough, said the Democrats); and a narcotics program (which though it promised $65‐million, could, because of the language of the bill, provide nothing this year). To many, however, the crowning blow came at the end. With the leadership of Mayor Lindsay and the lobby of May ors from across the state, the Democrats thought they could make an election‐year issue out of what they termed state neg lect of urban problems. But, in a display of the kind of flexibility that has kept Governor Rockefeller in office for more than a decade, a last minute program was devised that established an entirely new pattern of state‐local rela tions in money matters. Earlier the Governor had been ada mant in insisting that such programs could not be devised. Revenue sharing, keyed to the state income tax, which could be a major breakthrough in local government fiscal mat ters, moved from concept to law in a matter of weeks. Off track betting, a major revision of the lottery to allow com petition with illegal numbers games, and local taxing powers were poured into New York City in a way that made some say that the spigot of state control appeared to have lost its washer. Political Issues Vanish “It's really something,” said one Democratic Senator who had just taken heart when his party nominated Arthur J. Goldberg to lead its ticket in November. “He [the Governor] has wiped out every issue we had.” Still numb from the shock, the Democrats here find little encouragement in the record. However, some think that other issues will present themselves after reflection. Already there are rumblings that legislation conceived un der such pressure and passed in such haste will prove to be faulty, that what was promised may never be realized. And the Democrats, charging that Mr. Rockefeller's iron‐clad control over his party and the lawmak ing process had made hollow the cries of “bossims” that his party aims at the opposition, plan to lay every flaw at the feet of the Governor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"‘I Don't Advocate Big Families for Everyone,’ Says Mother of 13",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/21/archives/i-dont-advocate-big-families-for-everyone-says-mother-of-13.html,"MRS. JOSEPH CLAIR of Northvale, N. J., is preg nant again. Nobody in her family was very surprised, even though it will be the 14th blessed event in the Clair household. “They're all happy,” the 41‐year‐old brown‐haired (“I cover the gray”) housewife said the other day. “If I don't announce that I'm pregnant every few months, they ask me if I'm broken.” At a time when abortion reform is spreading across the country and population experts are urging two‐child families, Rose Mary Clair is one of those women who grin and bear more children. They feel that the size of their families is nobody's business. The Clairs (he's a life in surance salesman in New York) are one of the larger families of Leading Families of America, Inc., of Fairfield, Conn., an organization for families who have four or more children. Founded in 1965 The group, founded in Nor walk, Conn., in 1965, now claims to have a mailing list of 160,000 large families in 50 states. A large percentage of the families are Roman Catholic, but Protestants and Jews may also join. Until recently, the group's name was Large Families of America, Inc., but the name was changed, according to John Henry Norton, the group's national secretary, “because large families are under tremendous attack.” “It just seemed to be the wise course of action,” added Mr. Norton, who is an attor ney in Fairfield, where he lives in a roomy, 300‐year‐old house with his wife and eight of their 10 children. According to research done by L.F.A., the country's 6 million large famiiles (4 chil dren or more) are an important force in the United States because: ¶They raise 65 per cent of America's children. ¶They lead in the number of sons and daughters who serve in the armed forces. ¶They are the leading con suming families in the United States and also influence the consuming habits of many other families. ¶They lead in providing priests, nuns, ministers, rab bis, and other spiritual lead ers. But L.F.A. does not exist only to make its members feel less guilty about their prolificacy. The group also has three political goals: Raising income tax deductions to $1,000 for each dependent; establishing a National Fam ily Day on the Friday after Thanksgiving; and a housing program whereby city resi dents would be allowed to buy their public housing units or privately owned apart ments on a condominium basis. “The thing that everybody throws up to us,” said Mrs. Clair, “is how we're going to educate all our kids. Well, I don't even worry about it. Our two oldest boys go to Xavier, a Jesuit military school in Manhattan, and they pay their own way [$1,000 a year] by caddying at a golf course. Today there are so many means at your disposal, like scholarships and student loans. I always feel, where there's a will, there's a way.” There is also the problem of space. The Clairs simply don't have enough. So they recently put their six‐bed room, three‐bathroom house up for sale, and are looking for the impossible dream: One with 12 bedrooms and eight bathrooms. “Frankly, I don”t advocate big families for everyone,” Mrs. Clair said. “It”s all right for us because I happen to be healthy, and I think my hus band”s a saint, and we have no glaring discipline prob lems.” She said there were not as many problems as one might think when it comes to buying shoes (“You stag ger it”), clothes (“We use lot of hand‐me‐downs or clothes from neighbors”), and food, which costs between $400 and $500 a month. Mrs. Clair shops for groceries daily (whole sides of beef are a frequent purchase), and she takes them home in the family station wagon. The parents share the barbering chores. Mrs. Clair, a Roman Cath olic, is violently opposed to legalized abortion. “I think it's murder,” she said. “My husband calls it legalized homicide.” One of the couples who be long to L.F.A. are Rabbi and Mrs. Henry Okolica, of New Britain, Conn., who have only four children. “I thought my joining would give the organization a little bit of encouragement,” said the 57‐year‐old rabbi, who is the spiritual leader of Con gregation Tephereth Israel in New Britain. “They are large families, and they often have problems, so I thought I could give them some spirit ual advice.” ‘Fiber of the Nation’ Rabbi Okolica views the family as “the fiber of the nation,” and he thinks that society might have more problems if it were composed mainly of childless persons. “We might have more gamblers, more drunkards, and more lazy and immoral people,” he said firmly. The Andy Robustellis (he's the former star defensive end of the New York Giants) solved the eating problem in their Stamford, Conn., house hold by dividing their nine children into two shifts. “The younger children eat first,” said Mrs. Robustelli, a 43‐year‐old brunette who was her husband's high school sweetheart, “and the older ones get to eat with their parents.” The Robustellis have never had to face a problem that some large families encoun ter: Snide remarks about their number of children. “People really don't say too much, because Andy would have a good answer for them,” she said. Mr. Ro bustelli, now president of Na tional Professional Athletes, Inc., is 6‐feet‐l‐inch and weighs 225 pounds. Kenneth Turcott, 37, of Tenafly, N. J., is a pilot for American Airlines — and an only child. During his 10 days off a month, he “moon lights” as a baby sitter for his eight children while his wife, Carol, works as a reg istered nurse. “It isn't that she has to work,” the former Air Force pilot said recently. “She likes to get out of the house.” Mrs. Turcott, 36, said she saved money by “scouting” stores for good buys in food and clothing. And she thinks nothing of walking out with out buying anything, right past the icy stares of sales clerks, if she doesn't feel the price is right. Mr. Norton, 45, the na tional secretary of L.F.A., be lieves that manual labor is good for his children. (“It keeps their feet on the ground.”) So every Saturday he puts the eight who are still living at home to work keeping up the 13 rolling acres that surround his 13‐ room home. The youngsters also have certain duties during the week. They are listed on a “Responsibility Schedule” that is taped to the milk ma chine in the Nortons' kitchen, which is the size of many restaurant kitchens. The children (one of them, Sue Ming, 9, a former Hong Kong orphan, is adopted) re ceive no allowances, but are given money as they need it. They also buy all of their own clothes on this basis. “They really don't want much but the basics,” said Mrs. Norton, who is 46. “And they work much more than they spend.” Mr. Norton, an affable man who was senior judge of the Fairfield Municipal Court for four years, believes that large families have fewer discipline problems than smaller ones. “Nobody's on anybody's back too much of the time,” he said. “Instead of running them to dancing school or trying to make a virtuoso out of every one of them, the kids can go their own way and do their own thing.” But Mr. Norton, who leads his family in prayer at bed time every night, has not shortchanged his children when it comes to giving them the niceties of life. They have two tennis courts, two horses, and a trampoline. “They're worth going all out for,” Mr. Norton said. “Raising a family is the most important thing in life.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Summary of Measures Passed and Killed by Albany Legislature During '70 Session,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/22/archives/summary-of-measures-passed-and-killed-by-albany-legislature-during.html,"ALBANY, April 21—Follow ing are the major actions taken by the Legislature during the regular 1970 session that ended last night: Budget and Pay PASSED Budget of $7.14‐billion, or $117‐million less than the Gov ernor's request, for the fiscal year that began April 1. Signed by Governor Rockefeller. Supplemental budget of $65.2‐million, restoring some budget cuts. Deficiency budget of almost $83‐million, bringing total spending for the 1969–70 fiscal year to $6.3‐billion. Signed by the Governor. A $112‐million package of wage increases for 125,000 state employes negotiated with the Civil Service Employes As sociation. The package provides for a 7.5 per cent increase in the first year, retroactive to April 1, and 6 per cent next year. Increases will be paid in three stages. The first comes after executive approval; the second comes in October, a month before the election; and the last is to come next April 1, the beginning of the new fiscal year. The state's top administra tors were also voted pay in creases. For the chancellor of the State University and the Commissioner of Education, for example, this means an increase from their old salaries of $45, 000 to $48,125 effective last April 1, to $48,375 in October and to $51,275 next April. Ex cluding the Governor, they are the highest paid men on the state payroll.

The following resolutions must be acted upon by the 1971 Legis lature. PASSED Reduction of the voting age from 21 to 18. Repeal of Article XI, Section 3 of the State Constitution, popularly known as the Blaine Amendment, which prohibits direct or indirect aid to paro chial schools, and replacing it with the less restrictive word ing of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.

Appropriation of a cost of living rise for welfare recipi ents that, in effect, restored much of last year's $128‐million in welfare cutbacks. Bill stripping welfare depart ments of their power to with hold rents from landlords whose buildings prove “danger ous and hazardous” to relief families. Bill designed to accommo date United States Supreme Court rejection of last year's welfare cuts. It permits the State Commissioner of Social Services to pay less than the determined standard of welfare need when the Legislature de clines to appropriate enough funds. KILLED Governor's proposal for a plan of universal health insur ance in the state. Bill prohibiting construction of pollution‐control plants with in 3,500 feet of residential areas in New York City. Education PASSED Appropriation of $28‐million in state aid to nonpublic schools in the form of assist ance for examination and in spection expenses. The sum of $19.7‐million in state funds for three programs aimed at providing college edu cations for youths from slums. A total of $15.7‐million was earmarked for the SEEK pro gram, an acronym for Search for Education, Elevation and Knowledge. Of that amount, $6.7‐million was allotted for the State University system and the remaining $9‐million was set aside for the City Uni versity of New York. The bill requires the city to provide an additional $7‐million. The re maining $4‐million will go for the Higher Education Opportu nity Program, which applies Dnly to private institutions that have programs for educat ing youths from slums. Aid up to $4.2‐million for nonpublic medical schools by granting them a state stipend of $1,500 for each enrolled medical student.

Bill repealing a 1969 law that barred the use of busing in districts with appointed school boards to eliminate racial imbalance.

Environment PASSED Reorganized state's conserva tion efforts by consolidating all antipollution agencies, now in three departments, into a new Department of Environmental Conservation. State parks and other facilities were placed under a new Office of Parks and Recreation in the Gover nor's office. The Commissioner of Environmental Conservation is given the right to set mini mum acceptable pollution levels after consultation with a new, 15‐member State Environmental Board. Takes effect July 1. Measure that would empower the Public Service Commission to decide where to place power and gas transmission lines, overruling local ‐ordinances if they are “unreasonably restric tive.” Also sets up a state com mission to study the impact on the environment of public util ity facilities. Liberalized existing civil law procedures to make class ac tions against polluters easier. A stronger measure that would have permitted an individual or group to seek court orders to stop environmental abuses was killed. Restricted permission for drilling gas or oil wells in Lake Erie and other offshore areas. Restricted the use of persist ent pesticides such as DDT, but did not outlaw them entirely. KILLED Defeated an attempt to allow the use of chemical toilets that discharge treated sewage from boats, beginning enforcement of a 1967 ban on dumping sew age or garbage from any vessel. Transportation PASSED A transfer of the Public Serv ice Commission's jurisdiction over railroads, trucks and buses to the Department of Trans portation. A reorganization of the P.S.C. also gave its chair man full executive responsibil ity for the commission, made the commission bipartisan and shortened members' terms from 10 to six years. An emergency loan of $30.7‐ million to improve maintenance on the New York City subways and commuter railroads in the metropolitan area. Upstate bus lines also benefited. Approval of the Metropoli tan Transportation Authority's lease of the Harlem and Hud son Divisions of the Penn Cen tral and authorization of a $65‐ million modernization of the two commuter lines in West chester County. The bill, which awaits the Governor's signa ture, would give the M.T.A. control over almost all com muter service in the metropoli tan area. It now operates the Long Island Rail Road, the New Haven Division of the Penn Central and the city transit sys tem. A $162,500 appropriation, in cluded in the supplemental budget, for a transit study of the proposed bridge linking Rye and Oyster Bay, L.I. and other bridges spanning the Long Island Sound. The Governor ordered the Transportation De partment to stop any initial preparations for construction of the Rye‐Oyster Bay Bridge pending completion of the study. KILLED A bill that would have fi nanced the construction of a spur on the Long Island Rail Road to Kennedy International airport by authorizing the Port Authority to guarantee Metro polian Transportation Author ity bonds. (William J. Ronan, chairman of the M.T.A., said in New York today that defeat of the bill was “definitely a setback” in the plan to construct a high speed rail service linking mid town and the airport. He added that other means of financing the $150‐million project wouid be pursued.) Motor Vehicles PASSED Made it a facie violation for a driver to operate a motor ve hicle if the alcoholic content of his blood exceeds 0.15 per cent. For an average 170‐pound man, this would amount to 11 one‐ounce shots within two hours after dinner or eight shots without dinner. Required the licensing of snowmobiles and barred them from the public highways. Also required licensing of motorized minibikes. New York City PASSED A package of new revenue and tax measures, including new levies on commercial rent, hotel room charges, state collec tion of a $10‐a‐year auto use tax and the city income tax, ex tension of the 6 per cent sales tax to parking lots and garages, water charges on tax‐exempt property and new penalties on scofflaws.

Change in school decentral ization law to permit Manhattan to have six districts. Anticrime measure to fight pilferage at Kennedy, La Guar dia and Newark Airports. Spe cial police force would be sal up and run by the Waterfront Commission. Local Aid PASSED A revenue‐sharing measure that keys the amount of per capita aid distributed to the lo calities to 21 per cent of state income tax collections. The bill means an increase of $158‐mil lion in state aid for New York City in its upcoming fiscal year. Because of an overlap in fiscal years—the fourth quarter of the cities' fiscal year is the first quarter of the state's—the first revenue sharing distribution will come out of the state budget not this year but next. The city and the state's 62 counties will also get a one‐ third share in the proceeds of a revised lottery, while cities of 125,000 or more can at their option participate in an off track betting scheme (see Gam bling). Elections PASSED Reapportioned the state's 41 Congressional District. The bill was signed by the Governor. Even though the work of re apportionment was finished, the Joint Legislative Commission on reapportionment was continued with a budget of $175,000. Placed the names of incum bents first on the ballot in the June 23 primary election in New York City. Placement previous ly was by lot. The bill was lim ited to the city and is appli cable only this year. KILLED Expansion of the number of seats on the New York City Council from 37 to 4. Civil Rights PASSED Prohibited persons or com panies from making lie‐detector tests a condition of employ ment.

Guarantee working women the same rights as men in re ceiving wages while performing jury service. Made confidential communi cations between certified public accountants and their clients privileged information. KILLED Exemption of New York serv icemen from duty in any war that has not been declared by Congress as required by the Constitution. The bill, directed against the war in Vietnam, is similar to one passed this year in Massachusetts. Forbidding public reading of the names of servicemen killed in Vietnam without permission of the families. Prohibiting use of buildings financed in whole or part by the state by groups judged sub versive by the House Internal Security Committee or the De partment of Justice. Local Government PASSED Permitted local governmental units to appoint rather than elect tax assessors and set up standards for tax assessment. Barred municipal officers from accepting gifts worth more than $25 or from repre senting a client for compensa tion before the municipality of which he is an officer. Also required every county, city, town, village and school dis trict to adopt a code of ethics. Permitted paid city firemen who reside in communities having volunteer fire depart ments to join the volunteer companies. Consumers PASSED Two bills aimed at regulating the issuance of credit cards. One would prohibit the mailing of credit cards to people unless they were requested specifical ly in writing. The other would require issuers of unsolicited credit cards to enclose refusal forms with them which a con sumer would have to return to the Issuer. Exempion of the first $85 of a person's weekly salary from garnishee procedings. The limit previously was $30. Permission for stores open on Sunday to sell Christmas toys, trees and decorations. Measure creating a Consumer Affairs Division in the Execu tive Department. Prohibition, as of Sept. 1, of the sale of the skins of leop ards, tigers, cheetahs, alliga tors, crocodiles, polar bears and other endangered species. KILLED A meat packaging standard requiring transparent wrap pings on only one side that would have superseded New York City's law requiring all sides to be transparent. Public Authorities KILLED Bill permitting the State Con troller and city and county controllers to at any time in spect the books and accounts of the Metropolitan Transporta tion Authority or any of its sub sidiaries. Gambling PASSED An offtrack betting bill, that permits cities of 125,000 popu lation or more (or portions of a county containing 125,000 or more), after approval at a referendum, to participate through local option in an off track betting program super vised by a newly, established state commission. The city was authorized to set up its own offtrack system, with its revenues to come out of a 17 per cent charge on har ness track bets and a 16 per cent charge on thoroughbred track bets, split 80 per cent for the city and 20 per cent for the state. That same ratio holds for all local offtrack establishments, except that the split goes to 50‐50 if the city's revenues go over $200‐million. A revised lottery designed to stimulate sales, which permits the state to hold more frequent drawings, increase the prize pool, scale down ticket prices to as low as 25 cents, sell tick ets through vending machines, and sell tickets in bars and liquor stores. The bill also gives the city and the 62 counties a one‐third share, based on the number of tickets sold within their bound aries, in all lottery revenues over $26‐million. Authorized pari‐mutuel rac ing with quarter‐horses. Such horses, a cross between a mustang and a thoroughbred, have long been fixtures at county fairs, where they race on the quarter‐mile tracks. Courts and Crime PASSED An extensive revision of the state's Code of Criminal Pro cedure that sets forth how the system of criminal justice is to be administered. Amendment to the divorce law to eliminate the concept of the ‘guilty party’' and to reduce the minimum separation, time before divorce from two years to one.

The package would attempt to end present separate operations of the state and localities, com bining them through a Depart ment of Correctional Services. An increase in the jail term for making a telephone bomb threat from the present one year to up to four years. Creation of an organized crime task force in the Attor ney General's office that would be empowered to hold hearings and prosecute everywhere in the state. Measure prohibiting assistant district attorneys in Queens, Manhattan, Bronx and Brook lyn from holding outside jobs. KILLED Judicial reform bill that would have required the screening of State Supreme Court candidates by independ ent panels. A measure that would have permitted judges to order pre trial preventive detention for criminal suspects considered a “danger to society.” Narcotics PASSED Inauguration of $65‐million in programs directed at curbing addiction among the young. Treatment centers would be constructed with a $200‐million bond issue. The operating funds are offered to local govern ments on a 50 per cent match ing basis.

Permission for private pro prietary nursing homes to form business corporations. Increase in maximum unem ployment benefits from the present $65 a week to $75. Bill permitting members of the same profession, including physicians, lawyers and ac countants, to form corporations and obtain Federal tax advan tages. Recodification of laws gov erning professions. Banking and Insurance PASSED Mandatory arbitration on automobile accident claims in volving $3,000 or less. The pro gram calls for the establishment of arbitration panels consisting of three lawyers who will hear accident cases and settle them. KILLED A “no‐fault” system of auto mobile insurance that would have done away with the con cept of liability and made pay ments for injuries much in the way that workmen's compen sation does. Revision of bank district laws that would have permitted banks to open branches all over the state. Under current law banks (with certain exceptions for New York City institutions) are forbidden to open branches outside their home districts. Housing and Rent PASSED Creation of the State Mort gage Authority to sell $750‐ million in tax‐free bonds and reinvest this in purchasing old, low‐yield home mortgage loans from lending institutions. Antiblockbusting bill, which authorizes the City Commission on Human Rights to declare neighborhoods off‐limits to so licitation by real estate agents if there is evidence of panic selling based on racial fears. Bill authorizing limited, un secured loans to owners of multiple dwellings to clear up minor violations without dis placing tenants Bill permitting the city to make 100 per cent loans to sponsors of nonprofit housing. The present requirement of at least 5 per cent equity has proved inadequate in Model Cities areas. Bill permitting the city to begin proceedings to take over multiple dwellings quickly in the case of unpaid taxes and abandonment. The present waiting time of four years is generally reduced to two so that units might be saved be fore decay is irreversible.

Productive Session,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/22/archives/productive-session.html,"The highly partisan, terribly hectic, election‐year session of the New York State Legislature which just ended turned out, nonetheless, to be a distinctly pro ductive one. Governor Rockefeller's leadership proved firm and, especially at the end, progressive. The Legislature reformed the state's inhumane abor tion law which for more than a century had con demned women to unwanted pregnancies or to illicit abortions by dangerous abortion rings. A first step was taken toward amendment of the State Constitu tion to permit 18‐year‐olds to vote. A far‐reaching revenue‐sharing scheme, dramatically introduced late in the session and rammed through by the Governor, promises significantly increased state aid for finan cially parched urban areas. Cities will receive about one‐fifth of state income tax revenues, a more gen erous percentage than the mayors of the state's largest cities (banding together for the first time in a Big Six lobbying group) had even dared propose. New York City fared well in still other ways. Its request that the state legalize off‐track betting, so it could be taxed, proved a winner. The city will also receive a share of the state's lottery receipts. The increased aid from the state, coupled with new revenues that the state will allow the city itself to generate, all but closes the projected gap in Mayor Lindsay's budget, and assures continuation of essen tial services. The session was not without its disappointments, however. The Blaine amendment barring public tax aid to parochial schools now seems headed for repeal; and funds have already been appropriated in apparent contravention of the amendment. Instead of reforming the primary law, the Legislature enacted a bill to require listing of incumbents' names first on the primary ballot, an action apparently aimed at Reform Democrats planning to challenge incumbent Regular Democrats. Unfinished business usually creates campaign issues in an election year; this year, miraculously, a surpris ing amount was finished.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Punishing Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/23/archives/punishing-politics.html,"The Cayuga County Democratic Committeemen can and did refuse renomination to Assemblyman George M. Michaels—who cast the deciding vote in favor of the abortion reform bill—just as he predicted they would. He voted his conscience; they voted their politics of punishment. It is simple to say that this is the way politics are played in Auburn or elsewhere; getting elected is all that counts. The same reasoning and safe voting pre vented a humane abortion bill from being passed New York for a century. But the obvious retaliation by the Cayuga Democrats against a respected attorney and Assemblyman is a horror show of machine politics at its worst. Supporters are urging Assemblyman Michaels make a primary fight against the committeemen's choice, John Rossi, another Auburn attorney. Mr. Michaels should run so that the voters instead of the politicians can have their say about the attempted abortion of his legislative career.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bishops, Ending Parley, Pledge $50‐Million to Combat Poverty",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/24/archives/bishops-ending-parley-pledge-50million-to-combat-poverty.html,"SAN FRANCISCO, April 23— The American Bishops of the Roman Catholic Church ended a three‐day meeting today by narrowly defeating a motion to open portions of future sessions to the press and other observ ers.  Among other actions taken during their semiannual meet ing, the 216 Bishops did the following things: ¶Approved the taking of a new collection at Thanksgiving to finance a $50‐million domes tic antipoverty drive that the hierarchy hopes to start: ¶Reaffirmed their opposition to the liberalization or elmina tion of state laws against abor tion. ¶Expressed agreement with traditional church law discour aging priests from running for political office. Protests Missing The meeting was held in pri vate at the Fairmont Hotel atop Nob Hill. Several organized groups of laymen and priests had representatives in attend ance and met with a liaison committee of Bishops to pre sent requests, but there were none of the demonstrations and confrontations of the sort that have marked most recent church conventions. The only sign of protest came when a group of 11 Catholic and non‐Catholic women marched in a circle on the sidewalk out side the hotel carrying signs favoring abortion reform. They chanted, “Women control their own bodies; male Bishops won't.” The motion to open some de liberative sessions to the public was suggested by the depart ment of communications of the United States Catholic Confer ence, the administrative arm of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. It was defeated by one vote after a decision was made to require a two‐thirds majority rather than the usual simple majority. Because of the close ness of the balloting, however, a committee was appointed to study the issue, and some Bish ops expressed belief that the closed‐door policy would be somewhat modified at the next meeting in November. The National Federation of Priests' Councils, the National Association of Laymen and other reformist groups in the church have sought open meet ings. They have argued in part that Bishops should be more accountable in their actions to other segments of the church. John Cardinal Dearden, pres ident of the National Confer ence of Catholic Bishops, as serted that the Bishops had “no desire to operate in secrecy” and that their action today re sulted from an effort to bal ance the values of openness with “possibility for candid discussion.” Approved in Principle The Thanksgiving collection will be established to finance a program approved in !principle last November to combat domestic poverty. The Bishops pledged to “raise a fund of $50‐million over the next several years.” Accord ing to Bishop Francis J. Mugavero of Brooklyn, the chairman of the program, n details have yet been worked out on how the funds would be spent. Some staff members have expressed doubt over whether funds of such magnitude could be raised, especially in the face of a pattern of declining contributions to most national religious organizations at a proposal to merge the program with the Easter collection for overseas relief work was rejected. The abortion resolution ex pressed alarm at the national trend toward softening statte laws against abortion. It de clared: “Our opposition to abortion derives from our con viction that whatever is op posed to life is a violation of man's inherent rights, a posi tion that has a strong basis in the history of American law.” The conference adopted an other resolution urging Ameri can Bishops “to discourage” priests under their jurisdiction from seeking political office. The resolution cited docu ments from the Second Vatican Council on the responsibilities of laymen in the secular sphere.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Methodists Vote $4‐Million for Aid to Minorities,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/25/archives/methodists-vote-4million-for-aid-to-minorities.html,"ST. LOUIS, April 24 — The United Methodist Church com mitted itself today to give $2‐ million in 1971 and $2‐million more in 1972 to its Commission on Religion and Race to be used “in the service of minori ty peoples.”  The funds, authorized here by the 1,000 general confer ence delegates, would be dis tributed by the commission with authorization to seek the “advice and counsel” of black or minority caucuses. Efforts to limit the admin istration of the grants to Meth odist agencies only or to ex clude militant groups as bene ficiaries were defeated. The $4‐million represents roughly 10 per cent of the budget of the 11‐million‐mem ber church over the next two years. It will be raised through a reduction of regularly budg eted items such as home and foreign missions, education, health and welfare ministries. In addition, $4‐million is to be raised in a special fund campaign in each of the two years to strengthen the ?? black colleges supported by the church. Out of reserves, $500,000 will be earmarked in 1971 and 1972 for scholarships for mi nority group students. The conference also author ized the establishment of a permanent revolving loan fund of $10‐million to provide student higher‐education loans for mi nority groups. The loan fund will be ad ministered by the church's Gen eral Board of Education and will be obtained from money borrowed from other boards and agencies of the church. The Rev. Dr. Harold A. Bos ley, minister of Christ Church, Methodist, in New York and one of the architects of the proposals, said: “We endorse with utmost emphasis the need for a reor dering of priorities in our church for support of the prin ciple of self‐determination for minority groups and for the immediate development of a substantial increase in funds allocated to the Commission on Religion and Race for use in the service of minority peo ples.” Last Monday, the Black Methodists for Church Renewal asked the church to give blacks not less than $10‐million a year for higher education and not less than $5.5‐million annually to “undergird the concept of self‐determination.” The blacks put no two‐year limit on their requests. In addition, a flat sum of $5‐million was demanded, ear marked for economic develop ment in “poverty pockets.” A $1‐million scholarship and loan fund for minority group high school seniors was also re quested. Abortion Laws Opposed In a resolution approved late last night, the church called on state legislatures to repeal their abortion laws. The church said that the practice should be re garded strictly as a matter be tween a woman and her doctor, and not as a criminal act. The Methodist action fol lowed by only a few hours a statement on abortion issued by the Roman Catholic Bishops of the nation meeting in San Fran cisco. The Catholic prelates af firmed their opposition to the liberalization or elimination of abortion laws and expressed alarm at what they described as a trend to soften present state statutes. The Methodist resolution also called for the removal of re maining legal and administra tion restrictions on voluntary sterilization. Individuals ac cording to the resolution, should be given the right to decide after counseling whether they want to be sterilized. “The quality of our lives is increasingly threatened as the exploding population growth places staggering burdens upon societies unable to solve even their present growth problems,” the resolution said. In placing heavy stress on the moral implications of the population crisis and its threat to the future of mankind, the resolution urged action by the church, the government and in dividuals. It called on the church to underscore the Moral necessity of adopting the small family norm “as an essential principle for establishing the size of population and thus protecting the quality of life.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"DENIED PARTY AID, MICHAELS TO RUN",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/27/archives/denied-party-aid-michaels-to-run-assemblyman-who-backed-abortion.html,"AUBURN, N. Y., April 26— Assemblyman George M. Mi chaels, the Democrat of this city who was denied party endorsement for re‐election because of his decisive last minute vote for the abortion reform bill in the Legislature, announced tonight that he would seek renomination in the June 23 primary election. Mr. Michaels, who represents the Cortland and Cayuga coun ties' 122d District, said in an nouncing his decision that he believed that “this is not a single‐issue campaign, and this is not a single‐issue age.” The 59‐year‐old legislator was unable last week to gain the endorsement of the Cayuga County Democratic Committee as the party's candidate in the November election. He mustered 53 committee votes to 72 votes for John Rossi, 31, also an Au burn lawyer. Last‐Minute Switch on Bill When the abortion‐reform bill came to a vote in the Assembly on April 9, Mr. Michaels, who had previously voted against reform, changed his vote at the last minute, sobbing as he said, “I realize, Mr. Speaker, that I am terminating my political career, but I cannot in good conscience sit here and allow my vote to be the one that de feats this bill—I ask that my vote be changed from ‘no’ to ‘yes’.” The Assemblyman quoted Richard Cardinal Cushing as saying that “a good Catholic doesn't need a law to follow the tenets of his faith,” and added that “the abortion‐reform bill will not in any way re strict the beliefs of those who do not favor abortion.” He stressed that, “I want you to know that I harbor no bit terness against the party or the leadership.” He added that there had been intense pressure from his fam ily to change his vote: “I can't go back to my family on the Passover seder and tell them that George Michaels defeated this bill.” Mr. Michaels's district, which he has carried in previous elec tions since 1960 by narrow margins, is generally conserva tive and heavily Roman Catho lic. “I wish it could go without saying that I do not consider the abortion‐reform bill a reli gious issue,” he said in the statement prepared for delivery tonight. “I would hope that no one would.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Abortion Law Seen Burdening State,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/27/archives/abortion-law-seen-burdening-state.html,"The possibility that pregnant women from all over the coun try might inundate New York hospitals with requests for abortions has created an im mense organizational and fi nancial problem, two specialists in community medicine said here yesterday.  Referring to confusion and tension that they said had erupted within the medical world since the new liberalized abortion law was passed two weeks ago, both men empha sized that a number of serious logistical decisions would have to be made before the law went into effect on July 1. The law, which is one of the more liberal abortion statutes in the nation, allows the ques tion of abortion to be decided solely by a woman and her doctor. Dr. John Holloman Jr., who is chairman of the Physician's Forum and widely kown for his efforts to bring medicine into the civil rights movement, said that the cost of handling the expected influx of women would be so great that the Federal Government should share part of it. ‘Unfair’ Burden Seen Urging that Congress pass a national abortion law, he said, “It is unfair for some states to have to bear the entire bur den of the need for abortions, while other states have no law [to] take care of their popula tions.” Although he did not specify what the financial burden to the state might be, Dr. Hollo man said: “The problem will be a real one and it would be unfair to people to turn them away. And yet it would be un fair to New York City and to New York State to expect them to pay for it.” Dr. Holloman expressed his views on WNBC‐TV's “Open Circuit.” On “Man in Office,” on the same station, the city's health services administrator, Gordon Chase, was interviewed. Dr. Holloman and Mr. Chase emphasized that the chief con cern underlying all the logisti cal question that would have to be determined was the accessi bility of abortions to the poor. A large city task force is try ing to calculate how many women might request abortions during the first year, Mr. Chase said, so that the 18 municipal hospital could begin to prepare for them. Because projections range from 20,000 to 100,000 women who might seek abortions in municipal hospitals, “we have an awful lot of work to do be tween now and July 1,” Mr. Chase continued, to prepare for the new service. One way to cope with the great demand for abortions may lie, safely and pragmatically, in more flexible, less‐formal set tings than those associated with the traditional hospital, both men said. Referring to special clinics, the use of paramedical per sonnel and numerous other measures of dealing with the problem, Dr. Holloman said that his expectation of how the new law would be implemented were good. “Now I think we have a more rational and sane approach to this problem,” he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
High Court to Hear Abortion Law Plea,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/28/archives/high-court-to-hear-abortion-law-plea-court-to-hear-plea-on-law.html,"WASHINGTON, April 27— The Supreme Court agreed to day to consider the constitu tionality of the District of Co lumbia's antiabortion statute, which Is similar to the abortion laws, in effect in most states. By granting the Federal Gov ernment's request for a hear ing, the Court entered the grow ing national controversy over whether abortion should be solely a matter between a woman and her physician. The local statute, like the laws of most states, makes it a crime for a physician to per form an abortion except for therapeutic purposes that are narrowly restricted. Under the district's statute, doctors could perform abortions only when “necessary for the preservation of the mother's life or health.” Last November the law was declared unconstitutional by Federal District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell, who held that it was so vague that physicians could not be certain that they would not be prosecuted if they de cided in good faith that an abortion was justified. Indictment Thrown Out Judge Gesell, the son of the late pediatrician and author, Dr.. Arnold Gesell, ruled that to prosecute a doctor under such a law for exercising “his pro fessional judgment made in faith” would deny the physician due process of law. He threw out an indictment that had been filed against Dr. Milan Vuitch, a 54‐year‐old physician from Chevy Chase, Md., who had been accused of performing an abortion in the District of Columbia. Judge Gesell said that his ruling did not affect the law as it applied to nonohysicians. He refused to throw out an indictment against Dr. Vuitch's nurse, Shirley A. Boyd, 29. In appealing the ruling to the Supreme Court, Solicitor General Erwin N. Griswold said that as a result of it, “any licensed physician in the Dis trict of Columbia may perform an abortion on a pregnant woman who desires it, for any reason whatsoever.” He argued that the law should not have been declared unconstitutional for all situa tions involving licensed physi cians because he said frequent ly there is no ambiguity as to whether an abortion is neces sary to preserve a woman's health. As a result of a wave of abor tion reform in recent months, the legislatures of Hawaii, New York and Maryland have acted to abolish their criminal laws against abortions performed by physicians—at least when they are performed in the early months of pregnancy. Hawaii's law is now in effect. New York's law will become effective July 1. Maryland's Governor, Marvin Mandel, has not yet disclosed whether he will sign his state's new measure. Thirty‐six states have laws similar in wording to the Dis trict of Columbia's. In most of the remaining states the basic provisions are much the same, but some have been liberalized slightly by permitting abortions when rape, incest and possible deformity of the fetus are in volved. Other Challenges Seen If the Supreme Court should uphold Judge Gesell's ruling it would cast doubt on most of these laws and would probably precipitte a series of court challenges against antiabortion statutes. However, the District of Columbia is different from most in that it places the burden of proof on the physician to show that his operation was justified, and thus adds to the risk that a doctor takes when he decides to perform one. In agreeing to hear the case today, the Supreme Court noted that it could put off a ruling on the merits if it holds after the arguments that the appeal should have gone first to the Court of Appeals for the Dis trict of Columbia. The Justices will hear the case during the court term that begins in October. The Court also agreed today to decide next term if the Fed eral Government can constitu tionally require its employes to take an oath that they will not strike against the Govern ment and if it can deny em ployment to those who refuse. Last October a three‐judge Federal District court declared unconstitutional a United States law that bars persons from Federal employment who assert ahe right to strike. The suit was brought by the National Association of Letter Carriers, who also complained about the no‐strike pledge that Post Of fice employes are required to take. The District Court also struck that down. The rulings affected only the employes' rights in regard to the oaths and not the Federal law that forbids strike by United States employes. The Court announced that it will hold re‐arguments on four appeals next term, when it presumably will have its full complement of nine Justices. Three ofthe appeals concern the impact of the bill of rights on hearsay evidence rules, dou ble jeopardy rules and guilty pleas in capital cases. The fourth involves Congress's power to remove United States citizenship from persons who were born abroad of one United States parent, unless the child comes to live in this country for five years before reaching age 26.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
News Summary and Index,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/28/archives/news-summary-and-index-the-major-events-of-the-day-international.html,"TUESDAY, APRIL 28, 1970 Almost unanimous bipartisan opposition has developed in the Senate Foreign Rela tions Committee against giving military aid to the new Cambodian leaders. Secretary of State Rogers told the committee yester day that the Nixon Administration has made no decision on the Cambodian request for extensive military aid, but he suggested that the‐President has authority to send at least limited amounts of military aid without Con gressional approval. [Page I, Column 8.] The deposed former Cambodian Chief of State, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, and leftist leaders of North Vietnam, South Vietnam and Laos have pledged mutual support in their fight against the Linited States and its allies in Indochina. The meeting, accord ing to reports by the Hanoi radio, also called for stepped‐up fighting. 11:7–8.] Prospects for convening an international conference to deal with the crisis in Cam bodia were dealt a blow by the Soviet Union. Both Pravda, the Communist party newspaper, and Izvestia, the Government paper, attacked an Indonesian proposal for such a conference, and hinted that Soviet policy toward Cambodia would remain al lied to that of Hanoi. [3:5–6.] South Vietnam, through a visiting official, has asked Cambodia to take all measures necessary to prevent further action against her ethnic Vietnamese minority. The Cam bodians pledged to do so. 13:1–3.1 After years of warnings by Soviet scien tists on the dangers of pollution, the Soviet Union announced plans for a comprehensive law to conserve and protect the nation's waters. It invokes severe penalties and for bids the discharge of anything but treated sewage into waterways. [16:2–8.] President Nixon warned Republican Con gressional leaders that there would be no incentive for the Soviet Union to negotiate arms limitation if the United States under takes a “unilateral moratorium” on expan sion of the antimissile system or the multi ple warhead program. Mr. Nixon also cau tioned the Congressmen that the U.S. was in danger of becoming militarily inferior to the Soviet Union. [1:5.] In what may develop to have far‐reaching consequence the Suprem? Court decided to consider the constitutionality of a District of Columbia antiabortion law which has a clause declaring that doctors can perform abortions only when “necessary for the pres ervation of the mother's life or health.” The law is similar to the abortion laws in effect in most states. [1:2.] In direct conflict with the school deseg regation policies of the Nixon Administra tion, the United States Commissioner of Education, James E. Allen Jr., declared that he would continue to work to end segrega tion whether it was de facto or de jure. Last March President Nixon pledged to seek to end only de jure segregation. [1:7.] A new element in the family that includes vanadium, niobium and tantalum has been synthesized by a team of California physi cists. The scientists propose that the ex tremely short‐lived element, which would be No. 105 in the periodic table of elements, be named hahnium in honor of the late German physicist Otto Hahn. [32:1–4.] The Patrolmen's Benevolent Association announced that starting at 12:01 A.M. to morrow four‐fifths of the policemen on the force will call in sick and refuse to re port for duty. P.B.A. President Edward J Kiernan asserted that the stoppage was be ing taken because the city had violated its contract by giving sergeants a raise without giving one to patrolmen. [1:1.] Mayor Lindsay's special five‐member com mittee on police corruption held its first meeting behind closed doors. After the meet ing, City Corporation Counsel J. Lee Rankin said that he had rejected a proposal that a special state committee be set up to look into police corruption in the city. [1:2.] Thirteen persons were arrested at Hun ter College during a clay of disturbances. The college's president, Mrs. Jacqueline G. Wexler, announced earlier in the day that seven students had been suspended and vowed, that she would no longer tolerate “violence, force and bully tactics.” [1:2–3.] Yale University Law School students voted against suspending classes now while the campus is engulfed in debate over the trial of the Black Panthers.

Supreme Court's Actions,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/28/archives/supreme-courts-actions.html,"WASHINGTON, April 27—The Supreme Court took the following actions today: ABORTION Agreed to consider the con sider the constitutionality of the District of Columbia's anti‐abortion law, which is similar to the anti‐abortion statutes of most states (No. 1155, United States v. Vuitch). CRIMINAL LAW Agreed to rule on the le gality of an arrest warrant obtained on the basis of an officer's sworn charge that the defendant was guilty of burglary, without disclosing what information the officer had to establish probable cause to arrest the defendant (No. 1468 Misc., Whiteley v. Warden). INDIANS Held, 4 to 3, that land is now Oklahoma that was ceded by the United States to three Indian tribes in the early 19th century included the river bed of the lower Arkansas River, together with the oil and mineral re sources beneath it (No. 41, the Choctaw Nation and the Chickasaw Nation v. Okla homa; No. 59, Cherokee Na tion v. Oklahoma). Ruled, 7 to 1, that the Sec retary of the Interior's statu tory power to review Indians' wills dispersing land under the Interior Department's jurisdiction does not give him the authority to invali date an Indian's will because he finds it imprudent or in equitable (No. 300, Tooahnip pah v.

Administration sources declined to say just how many Americans would be involved, but some sources said that it would be only a few hundred and stressed the limited na ture of the decision. [Page 1, Columns 5‐8.] The Defense Department announcement followed by a few hours the launching of a massive South Vietnamese attack into Cambodia. The operation involves thousands of troops, accompanied by American advis ers, and is backed by United States planes and heavy artillery. [1:6‐7.] Congress, led by Senate Foreign Relations Committee members, reacted bitterly to the Administration's decision. A move quickly developed to cut off any funds for American military activities in Cambodia. A constitu tional debate over whether the President has the right to embark on military action with out Congressional consent seemed inevita ble after the decision. [1:5.] President Nixon ordered an “immediate and full” evaluation of intelligence reports that the Soviet Union has substantially in creased its role in the defense of Egypt. Administration sources said that the Soviet action had probably upset the balance of power in the Middle East and could lead to a reconsideration of the decision not to sell jets to Israel for the time being. [1:4.] The Roman Catholic Bishops in Rhodesia have intensified their defiance of the Gov ernment. The Bishops threatened to close all the church's schools, hospitals, orphan ages and other social welfare institutions the Government did not retreat from a law that forbids interracial worship. [1:7.] National The transcript of the secret inquest into the death of Mary Jo Kopechne was released by the Massachusetts Superior Court. The transcript revealed that Judge James A. Boyle, who presided, could not accept as true certain portions of the testimony of Senator Edward M. Kennedy. The judge con cluded that the Senator had been driving negligently and therefore was liable to fur ther prosecution. [1:1‐3.] In Washington, Senator Kennedy said he had spoken truthfully at the inquest and rejected Judge Boyle's report that he had contributed to the death of Miss Kopechne. Mr. Kennedy said that the judge's findings were not justified. [1:3.] The Senate Judiciary Committee concluded hearings in one day on the nomination of Judge Harry A. Blackmun to the Supreme Court. The session was friendly, producing praise from both liberals and conservatives and no opposition. [1:4‐5.] At the opening session of Senate hear ings on President Nixon's welfare reform proposals, liberals and, conservatives united to attack the plan, but for different reasons. Conservatives felt that the bill would en courage persons to go on welfare rather than seek a job, and liberals attacked because it did not provide enough assistance for the poor. [22:1‐6.] Metropolitan City hospital officials issued a statement pledging to perform medically sound abor tions on all New York City women who want them and promised to make the avail ability of abortions widely known. The city, however, has not yet decided how it will deal with women from outside the state who come to the city for an abortion. [1:1‐2.] Michael J. Maye, president of the fire man's union, said that if the city police re ceived the pay raise they were demanding, his members would expect an increase also. Mr. Maye also said that if the National Guard were brought into the city to break a police work stoppage, it would have to fight fires as well. [1:3.] New Jersey's Division of Civil Rights said it was drawing up a regulation that would require the landlords of apartment houses with 25 or more units to file annual lists designating the race of their tenants. The lists would be used by the state as legal evidence if they showed systematic patterns of discrimination. [1:1.] Yale students, who have been on striko for a week in support of the Black Panthers, joined ranks behind the school's president, Kingman Brewster Jr., whose ouster was proposed by Vice President Agnew.

City Hospitals to Perform Abortions for All Who Ask,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/30/archives/city-hospitals-to-perform-abortions-for-all-who-ask-city-hospitals.html,"City hospital officials pledged every effort yesterday perform medically sound abortions on all New York City women who requested the operation after the new reform law became effective on July 1. The official statement went beyond mere compliance with the state's new abortion reform law. It promised to “make the availability of this service wide ly known among the women of New York City.” The city has not determined, however, how it will deal with pregnant women from outside the state who come here to take advantage of New York's lib eralized abortion procedures. The new law does not require that women establish residence for any period before seeking abortions. Yesterday's declaration was issued by the 15‐member board of the quasi‐independent corpo ration that will assume control of the city's 18 public hospitals on July 1, taking over the func tions of the present Department of Hospitals. Before issuing the statement, members of the new board— along with officials of the Health and Hospitals Depart merits—conferred with officers of the Greater New York ‘Hos pital Association, which coordi nates programs of nonprofit hospitals and nursing homes; and municipal hospitals. Abortion reform advocates have encountered more resist ance than they had expected, among obstetricians and gyne cologists in the private hospitals. Many specialists agree in principle that women should receive obortions on request but they do not wish to become involved personally in what they regard as a monotonous assembly‐line procedure. Estimates of the number of women who will seek abortions in New York City range from 20,000 to 100,000 a year. The higher figure comes from Dr. Alan Guttmacher of the Planned Parenthood organiza tion, a proponent of clinics that could perform large num bers of abortions. Yesterday's statement noted that no medical standards have been established for abortions. Dr. Guttmacher has said that clinics could be established in abandoned stores and ware houses. Most professionals insist, however, that abortions should be performed in or near a hos pital. As a minimum, they say, have the appropriate laboratory tests before the operation, an obstetrician and anesthetist should be nearby and blood transfusions should be quickly accessible. A study into proper medical standards for abortions is be ing undertaken by an advisory committee to the city's Health Department. This committee is headd by Dr. Saul Greenbarg, chief of obstetrics and gyne cology at Mount Sinai Hospital and chairman of the same de partment at the Mount Sinai Medical School. Within the Health and Hos pitals Departments, studies are also being made to determine what new facilities and person nel will be needed to meet the demand for abortions, and how private physicians and hospitals can be persuaded to help. Yesterday's statement made no mention of costs. Women now eligible for free medical care in municipal hospitals would, if their city‐paid physi cians agreed, get abortions without charge. Private hospitals and phy sicians would set their own fee schedules, as they do now for other operations.

BRITISH EASE RULE ON STERILIZATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/01/archives/british-ease-rule-on-sterilization-more-vasectomies-expected-under.html,"LONDON, April 30 — The Government announced today that male sterilization opera tions could be performed free and with comparative ease un der the National Health Service. In a decision that simplifies problems of family planning, Richard Crossman, Secretary of Social Services, said the opera tion would be performed in the interests of the health of either husband or wife. The consent of both would be required. Previously, doctors have per formed the operation under the Health Service only when it was in the medical interest of the man concerned. The decision was welcomed by groups promoting the wider use of sterilization in family planning. Dr. L. N. Jackson, honorary director of the Simon Popula tion Trust's voluntary steriliza, tion project in Devon, said in a telephone interview that about 12,000 such operations had been performed in four years. He predicted a sharp increase. The cost of the operation, known as a vasectomy, under private medical care varies from about $150 if performed by a private physician in Lon don to about $24 if performed at a provincial clinic. The operation is performed in 10 or 15 minutes under a local anesthetic, normally with no reaction after 48 hours. Dr. Jackson said his investigation of 1,000 cases had shown no effect on sexual potency or per formance. Mr. Crossman extended the National Health facilities into the family‐planning area in line with his expressed beliefs that family planning offered a bet ter solution to social problems than abortion. An announcement making birth‐control pills and other contraceptives available under the National Health Plan had been awaited. Questions of costs apparently intervened. The British Medical Associa tion said that unless additional money and facilities were made available by the Government to the hospital authorities to help meet the expected additional demand, the performance of vasectomies would interfere with more important work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"NOW's New President Sees Men Helped, Too",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/02/archives/nows-new-president-sees-men-helped-too.html,"THE new president of the National Organization for Women (NOW) is tall, slen der, well‐educated, divorced, glib, 44 years old, a fervent feminist, and heads her own industrial consulting firm in San Francisco. And—perhaps most signi ficant for a group that is thought to have concentrated on liberating white middle class women—she is black. “Black women are very much a part of NOW,” Mrs. Eileen C. Hernandez said yesterday in an interview. “In the past,” she went on, “many of them thought some of the issues—such as com bining marriage with a ca reer—were a bit passe. Black women had been doing that for years because it takes both the husband and wife to make a living in a black fam ily. “But now I feel NOW's is sues are very much related to black concern. I think both the black struggle and our struggle are part of the same revolution—the human revo lution.” Mrs. Hernandez, a native of Brooklyn, was elected pres ident of NOW last March at the group's annual confer ence in Des Plaines, Ill. She replaced Betty Friedan, who founded the organization in October, 1966. ‘Major Issues’ NOW's major issues, Mrs. Hernandez said, are repeal of abortion laws, free day care centers where mothers who want to work can leave their children, equal employment opportunities for women, passage of the Equal Rights Amendment, which was first proposed in 1923, and getting a woman on the Supreme Court. She said she thought the abortion reform bills that have been passed by several state legislatures will not cause a decline of interest in NOW. “We're still for total re peal,” she emphasized. “I think that all the new abor tion laws are an indication of the success of our move ment.” Mrs. Hernandez was in New York for business ap pointments and to see the women's liberation play, “Mod Donna.” This weekend she will attend a NOW board meeting in Washington to work out strategy for a “day of observance” on Aug. 26— the 50th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the vote. Dramatic Emphasis “Some women may strike” she said. “Others will use other forms to dramatically emphasize the oppression of women.” Mrs. Hernandez, dressed in a coral and white wool en semble with a matching scarf in her hair, was very definite when asked what she thought was NOW's greatest accom plishment. “The media no longer look at our movement with such great humor,” she said firmly. “We used to get asked, ‘Do you mean you want men to become Playboy bunnies?’ Nobody asks things like that anymore.” Even though she considers NOW to be “very radical,” she said she thought the group could accomplish some of its objectives within the system. She added that at least 10 NOW candidates were running for political of fice across the country, “ranging from local office to Federal office.” At present, NOW has about 62 chapters in the United States with about 3,000 mem hers‐10 per cent of them men. ‘Common Victims’ “We do not see men as the enemy,” Mrs. Hernandez said. “We see them as common victims. The liberation of wo men will be the liberation of mem as well, because it will help break down some of the stereotypes that hang up men, like the notions that they are supposed to be ag gressive, competitive, and have a lot of sexual con quests.” Mrs. Hernandez has B.A. degree in political sci ence from Howard University and an M.A. in government from California State Col lege. In 1965 she was ap pointed to the Equal Employ ment Opportunity Commis sion, but resigned after 18 months because she felt the commission was “not effec tive.” She was married to a gar ment cutter for four years in San Francisco, but divorced him in 1961, “long before NOW was formed.” The dia mond ring on her left finger is not her old engagement ring, she said, “but a gift from a friend.” “I like men — the ones that are liberated,” she said. “But I'm not terribly committed to marriage. I think that any in stitution that is premised on a subordinate‐dependent rela tionship is an anachronism.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Insurers Raise Costs To Doctors,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/03/archives/insurers-raise-costs-to-doctors.html,"In San Francisco not too long ago, a woman filed a $1‐million lawsuit against a doctor on charges that he performed a legal abortion on her but that she gave birth to a baby anyway.  The case may seem some what out of the ordinary but it is fairly typical of the sit uation in California and in creasingly typical of the situation almost anywhere in the country. Patients have begun to sue doctors with a vengeance. As a result, doctors are discov ering that rates for malprac tice insurance are going sky high. In New York, for example, rates for doctors who per form no surgery have climbed from $247 just two years ago to $466 today. Rates for this same doctor in Los Angeles —a particularly troublesome area—jumped from $295 to $831 today. Rates for surgeons and for 1 other specialists are much higher. For example, a car diac surgeon in New York now pays $2,331 a year against $989 in 1968. This same man in Los Angeles now pays $4,203 a year against $1,178 in 1968. A plastic surgeon—whose rates are among the highest —pays $3,030 in New York and $5,254 in Los Angeles against $1,236 and 1,473 a year, respectively, two years ago. Rates Are Advisory For these prices, the doctor gets coverage up to $100,000 for injuries paid to one pa tient and a total of $300,000 in payments a year for more than one suit. Of course, if a doctor is successfully sued —and many are—he can re instate his original policy limits by paying additional premiums. On top of that, these rates, which are published by the Insurance Rating Board of New York, are only advisory. Insurance companies rarely charge less than these rates and many often charge con siderably more than them, particularly if their experi ence with a particular class of doctor, say, an eye, ear, nose and throat man, has been unfavorable. There are many specialist surgeons in California, for example, who pay as much as $8,000 to $10,000 a year for malpractice insurance. One reason is that Califor nia does not require a patient to appear in court with a medical doctor as his expert. Many other states, including New York, insist that an M.D. testify for the patient—often a difficult thing for a patient to accomplish. Charles Kramer, of the New York law firm of Kramer & Dillof, nationally recognized as a defender of patients against doctors and hospitals, explained in an interview re cently that in California the courts accept the doctrine of “res ipsa loquitor,” (the thing speaks for itself). Thus no doctor is needed by the pa tient to prove wrongdoing by another doctor. Must Inform Patient Massachusetts and Nevada courts permit patients to use recognized textbooks in the absence of an expert to dem onstrate that a particular medical procedure was bad practice. Florida, Mr. Kramer said, was one of the first states to recognize what lawyers call the “informed consent” doc trine. New York, California and several others now also recognize this concept. What it means is that a doctor, to avoid a malprac tice suit under this doctrine, must inform his patient of any hazard or risk in certain surgery or diagnosis. For example, Mr. Kramer noted, shock therapy may re sult in the fracture of legs and arms and a patient should be informed of this risk. Trend Expanding Then the doctor could not be sued under the “informed consent” concept. But he /night still be sued for other cause if negligence could be proved. “Doctors often ask patients to sign that they've been informed of the risk,” Mr. Kramer said. “The American Medical Association even has a form book for doctors.” Despite the sharply rising incidence of malpractice suits, lawyers often feel strongly that insurance companies are uncooperative. The American Trial Law yers Association not too long ago denounced what it called “a great conspiracy of si lence” between doctors and insurance companies on making the medical records of patients available to lawyers in malpractice suits. Patients, according to the Erie County Bar Association upstate, are growing militant for good cause: Their rela tionship with their doctor is becoming more and more im personal, with patients now looking on their doctor in many cases as a commercial technician. As a result, this bar association contends, pa tients have no qualms about suing their doctor. Henry W. Otis, president of Marsh & McLennan, the world's largest insurance bro ker, has even found a trend for malpractice insurance in professions other than medi cine, dentistry and law. “More and more educators and law enforcement offi cers, for example, are seek ing liability insurance related to their occupations,” he said. Moreover, he contended, the list of professions re quiring malpractice insurance protection “will certainly ex pand” in the next five years. But doctors continue to en joy some sort of record for malpractice suits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Easier Abortions Will Bring Problems,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/03/archives/easier-abortions-will-bring-problems.html,"Though New York's legal prohibition against abortions will end July 1, major practi cal problems remain unre solved. Leading advocates of reform, such as Dr. Alan Guttmacher, fear the medical establishment Will find itself woefully unready to help tens of thousands of women desperately seeking to end their pregnancies. In New York City alone, Dr. Gutt macher expects a demand for 50,000 to 100,000 abor tions a year. Despite the uncertainties, the city's health authorities last week boldly declared their intention to provide medically sound abortions to all city women who seek them. Further, the announce ment said, the city will “make the availability of this service widely known.” ‘Heavy Toll’ The statement, Issued by the directors of the semi autonomous corporation that will take over the city's 18 public hospitals on July 1, declared: “We believe that this legislation was intended to end the heavy toll on in dividuals, society and the health services structure of New York City exacted by the medically unsound abor tion techniques resorted to in the past by large numbers of women.” Under the new law, one of the most liberal in the country, the question of abortion may be decided solely by a woman and her physician — up to the 24th week of pregnancy. After that, the operation may be performed only to save the mother's life. The city's policy statement, bold as it was, raised many questions and answered none. Among them are these: What medical standards should govern abortions? What additional facilities and personnel will be needed? How can private hospitals and physicians help meet the demand? How should re quests by nonresidents be handled? The statement made no mention of the question most frequently asked by the pub lic: What will it cost? Physicians performing ille gal abortions typically charge between $400 and $800, though many extort consider ably more. Therapeutic abor tions performed legally un der the present law generally cost $200 to $300 in a private hospital. In public hospitals, poor women are charged little or nothing. Dr. Guttmacher proposes the creation of community abortion clinics. He believes that these, nonprofit facili ties could break even by charging $100 to $150 for women who can afford it, and no fee for financial hardship cases. The Standards Most obstetricians believe clinics of this sort should be in or near hospitals. At a minimum, they say, there should be appropriate lab oratory tests prior to the op eration, a trained anesthetist on the scene, and ready ac cess to a blood bank. Dr. Gordon Douglas, chief of obstetrics at Bellevue, is considering a program in which, for routine abortions, pregnant women would not formally be admitted to the hospital at all. They would arrive in the morning for the operation and—if all went well — leave late the same day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
News Summary and Index,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/04/archives/news-summary-and-index-the-major-events-of-the-day.html,"MONDAY, MAY 4, 1970 The Major Events of the Day International American and South Vietnamese troops entered their third day yesterday, of the massive sweep of the fishhook area of Cam bodia, but they have found neither signifi cant numbers of enemy troops nor the underground headquarters that intelligence analysts believed housed the Communists' central office for South Vietnam. The troops uncovered only caches of medical supplies and large quantities of rice and ammuni tion. [Page 1, Column 8.] Enemy forces conducted the heaviest at tacks in a month in South Vietnam this weekend. The United States command in Saigon said that the upsurge in enemy activ ity included 77 mortar and rocket attacks and a half dozen ground assaults during a 24‐hour period. United States casualties numbered 15 killed and 79 wounded. [1:7–8.] Vice President Agnew and Secretary of State William P. Rogers described the large United States bombing raid in North Viet nam as only a continuation of a long‐stand ing policy of self‐defense for American forces in Southeast Asia. [1:7.] More than 2,000 well‐equipped ethnic Cambodian soldiers in American‐run units in South Vietnam have been flown to Pnom penh, the capital of Cambodia, as reinforce ments for the Cambodian Army. The troops will fight under control of the Cambodian Army while in the country. [1:6.] From Sweden to Italy, the Western Euro pean worker is staging wildcat strikes. The new rnilitance of the workers underlines growing dissatisfaction with their traditonal union establishments. Most of the walkouts are led by employes in the pits and factories and not by their union leaders. [1:2–3.] National A movement for a nationwide student strike protesting American military involve ment in Southeast Asia appeared to be gain ing momentum. The editors of 11 Eastern col lege papers drafted an editorial calling for “the entire academic community of this country to engage in a strike.” [1:2–3.] “People felt ecology would unite the coun try. It will prove more divisive than black power, even more divisive than the war in Vietnam,” says Luther P. Gerlach, an an thropologist who has studied the ecology movement for the last two years. Some environment experts agree with him and predict there will be a backlash against the ecology movement as soon as the specifics of ecology are discussed. [1:4–5.] A number of prominent antiwar spokes men were among the 75 persons arrested for protesting the Vietnam war and United States involvement in Cambodia. The pro testers, who were holding a prayer service in a park across the street from the White House, included Dr. Benjamin Spock, the noted pediatrician. [9:1.] Senator Ralph W. Yarborough, liberal Texas Democrat, felt that his loss in the Texas primary was primarily due to his vote against a proposal by the late Senator Everett Mckinley Dirksen to allow prayers in public schools. [27:2–8.] Interviews with sources close to Judge James A. Boyle and District Attorney Edmund S. Dinis, and with Leslie H. Leland, foreman of the grand jury that looked into the case last month, indicate that no addi tional legal action was taken against Sena tor Edward M. Kennedy because officials were apparently convinced there was no evidence or witness to substantiate a new charge against the Senator. [30:3–5.] Metropolitan As 3,000 members of the National Guard left New Haven, there was a general relaxa tion of fear in the city, which had seen peaceful weekend rally in support of the Black Panther party. Kingman Brewster Jr., the president of Yale, spoke out against proposed nationwide student boycott of classes, planned in opposition to the war in Southeast Asia. [1:1.] A proposal requiring women who want abortions in New York City to have lived here for seven months has been introduced in the City Council. The residency require ment was proposed by Councilman Bertram R. Gelfand, a Bronx Democrat, who said he did not want the city to become “the nation's abortion capital.” [1:3–4.] Justices Harold A.

"But in Elmira, 21,000 of 25,000 Rate CATV a Necessity",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/04/archives/but-in-elmira-21000-of-25000-rate-catv-a-necessity-in-elmira-21000.html,"ELMIRA, N.Y.—Cable tele vision is as familiar to this city as the clang of church bells on Sunday. Of a pos sible 25,000 household cus tomers, 21,000 pay $4.50 month to be “on the cable.”  Subscribers to cable tele vision, which came here in 1955, have a choice of 12 channels. During the foot ball season they can daily among four professional games. On Saturdays they can dip into as many as 20 movies. But without cable television in this hill‐sur rounded city, TV is limiteu to a couple of snow‐flecked, ghost‐congested pictures. The result is that the fin ger‐wide cable has become the common cultural denom inator. It binds rickety homes of the East Side with grandi ose mansions of Strathmont Park. It stretches among telephone poles in posh sub urbia and squalid areas marked for urban renewal. “I'm sure,” says Thelma King, director of the central library, “that cable television, by bringing in so many television stations, has en larged the horizons of many of us here. I know, for in stance, that any time some old movie based on a novel is shown, we get requests for the book for perhaps the first time in years. Still, when my grandchildren be gan singing commercials in stead of reciting poetry, I found it painful.” One of the major argu ments in favor of cable tele vision has been that its mul tiplicity of channels stimu lates original programming on local issues and on edu cational matters that are noncommercial. How has this worked in Elmira, where the cable tele vision company, Elmira Video, has a profitable operation? So far Elmira Video, owned by Teleprompter, which has a franchise in New York City, has limited its pro gramming to giving the time, weather and stack market reports and an occasional blurb for important charity drives. The manager of the company, Donald D. Schil ling, says it will probably be originating programs in the fall, when it plans to move to new quarters. Community Programs, Too Indirectly, however, the cable has made television more community ‐ conscious. The size of the local audi ence led to the establishment of WENY‐TV, an American Broadcasting Company affili ate, one of whose programs —from 11:30 P.M. to mid night on Sundays—has at tracted considerable atten tion. Known as FOCUS (For Our Christian Understand ing), it is put on by the Rev. Francis W. Park 3d of the First Presbyterian Church and the Rev. Robert Lester of the Park Congregational Church. With invited guests, and an audience throwing ques tions by phone, the program has dealt with such subjects as abortion, narcotics, the news media, pollution, the Vietnam war and racial ten sions. It is unsponsored. The result has been that WSYE, the National Broad casting Company outlet, which was here first, has in creased its own community coverage. Recently it did a show on pollution of the Che mung River, which runs through this city. Programs for Classrooms Another important televi sion by‐product of the cable has been the video programs beamed into the classrooms by the city's Audio Visual TV. Ironically the director of these programs, J. Gerald Loughlin, a former junior high school principal here, who gives courses in tele vision at Elmira College, is a bit miffed at Elmira Video. “It bothers us,” he say: “that cable television keeps using us as an example of what they are doing for the community. We do the work. And what's more, the city pays Elmira Video $5,000 a year for equipment that is far from the best,” Dr. Charles E. Davis. Su perintendent of Schools here, says: “There is no question that these programs are a terrific aid to instruction, if the teacher is properly moti vated and ties them in with the teaching.” In a classroom at the Edge worth public school, 23 sec ond‐graders were being pre pared one morning for one of these television programs, called “Animals That Fly.” Their teacher, Margaret Bourke, asked them to recall the birds they had seen and talked about in a previous session. The children were eager and attentive as they spilled out information about sparrows, pigeons, humming birds, bluebirds, robins, eagles. Then, during the 20‐min ute television program— available to homes, too— they were quite as they lis tened to a teacher on the screen and looked at models of birds and films of birds migrating. Later, in the school's in formation center—it has variety of audio‐visual aids as well as books—a few doz en older children chatted to ward the end of lunch hour. A cluster of half a dozen sixth‐grade boys was asked about the school television program on books. None had read the books discussed on television, and only one said he ever read for pleasure. All agreed they enjoyed the lessons on television. One said: “It's better than read ing books.” The average Elmira view er can see more than video addicts in New York City do. He gets programs of the ma jor networks; offerings of the local outlets for N.B.C. and A.B.C.; the three independ ent stations in New York City—WPIX, WOR‐TV and WNEW‐TV. H also gets the educational programs of the nonprofit stations. WNYC in Syracuse and WSKG in Binghamton. “We probably have more tuner problems in this city than anything else,” says Tom Kelly, manager of one of the two Chemung elec tronics stores here. “The cable killed our antenna business. Once they get ‐on the cable, seems they just can't stop turning the knob.” What will happen to this dial‐turning city when Elmira Video starts originating pro grams in the fall? What will it be able to do without spon sors? Will it be able to get sponsors? Will sponsors pay enough to support original programming? When Elmira Video originates shows, will it force the outlets of N.B.C. and A.B.C. to step up their own local coverage? None of these questions can be answered yet. But meanwhile the fundamental significance of the success of cable television in this city may have been expressed most accurately by Irving Kahn, head of Teleprompter. He said: “Elmira is proof that cable television is the next best thing to a legal narcotic. Once you get on the cable, you never get off.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Letters to the Editor of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/04/archives/letters-to-the-editor-of-the-times.html,"To the Editor: The attempt by a Taiwanese revolutionary to assassinate Chiang Ching‐kuo, eldest son of President Chiang Kai‐shek, should shock Americans into taking a hard look at the Gov ernment on Taiwan which the United States has been support ing for twenty years.  American tourists visiting Taiwan are shown the usual attractions on which tourism flourishes and learn nothing about the police state which Chiang Kai‐shek imposed on the ten million Taiwanese in 1949. Congressmen who visit the island are entertained in the luxurious Grand Hotel and exposed chiefly to the appeals of the Generalissimo and Mad am Chiang for military support to harrass and take over the mainland. The indifference of Congress to the repressive rule of Chiang and his son, and the State Department's position on “non interference in the internal af fairs of the Taiwanese Gov ernment,” indirectly help to perpetuate political crimes far greater than those against which our revolutionary fore fathers rebelled. Paid informers are stationed in schools, hotels, restaurants, etc., to spy on people and re port anything that may be con strued as subversive. Civilians are arrested, held incommuni cado, secretly tried and sen tenced by military courts. The island has been under martial law since 1949. Criminal Code When Chiang Kai‐shek fled to Taiwan he brought with him the criminal code enacted in 1935 to deal with his Commun ist enemies on the mainland. In Taiwan the code has been modified, making it easier to convict political offenders and to mete out severer penalties. The shot fired at Chiang Ching‐kuo at the Hotel Plaza, while not to be condoned, ex presses the frustration and des peration of young Taiwanese patriots whose desire for free dom resembles that of the men who fought at Lexington and Concord. Because of U.S. pol icy toward Taiwan, Americans cannot completely dissociate themselves from the guilt of the would‐be‐assasin and his accomplice. It is to be hoped they will not he deported to Taiwan, to torture and death. As the 200th anniversary of the founding of our nation ap proaches, what could he more fitting than to end the policy of supporting police state gov ernments around the world, like that on Taiwan, and take our stand on the principles and values which motivated the writing of the Declaration of Independence and the Consti tution of the United States. [Editorial April 25.1 J. STUART INNERST La Jolla, Cal., April 26, 1970 • Michaels' Vote To the Editor: Your April 23 editorial at tempted to ennoble the motive of Assemblyman George Mi chaels when he voted in favor of the abortion reform bill. It is clear that Assemblyman Michaels had previously de cided to vote against the bill and changed his mind, not as a matter of conscience, but (by his own admission) to keep peace in his family. This may be an expedient reason for Mr. Michaels, but it was hardly worthy reason for his vote as a representative of his constit uents on this important bill. The exercise of “conscience” in his vote escapes me and many others who witnessed Mr. Michael's statement on tele vision. ROBERT M. BARRY Larchmont, N. Y., April 23, 1970 • Abuse of Legal Process To the Editor: As a lawyer, I was shocked that a South Carolina court has sentenced three persons to six‐ year terms for operating G.I. coffeehouse. Though the charge was public nuisance, the judge made it plain that the harsh sentences were a result of his “fear for what is in store for this country.” The very trial of these indi viduals represents a gross mis use of the criminal law. The punishment, which hardly fits the “crime,” is an abuse of judicial discretion. Violence is not only Students for a Democratic Society mem bers interrupting a college lec ture. It is also the state using criminal prosecution and im prisonment to silence unpopu lar voices. In this last form, it is particularly insidious and poses the greatest threat to a democracy. It will not be enough to re verse the convictions. This event provides an excellent op portunity to understand the way the criminal process is used to attain extralegal ends. STEPHEN GILLERS New York, April 29, 1970 • Lead in Gasoline To the Editor: Awareness and indignation regarding the high concentra tion of lead in urban air is growing. Since virtually all air borne lead derives from auto motive exhaust, consideration is now being given to the complete removal of lead from gasoline. Lead raises the octane rat ing. Today's gasoline contains about four grams a gallon, and results in an annual emission of approximately 300,000 tons of lead. To preserve current octane ratings (95–100) in the absence of lead, most commer cial gasolines will require extensive reformulation. The octane‐preserving modification favored by oil companies in volves increasing the propor tion of aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene derivatives) in gaso line. Enhanced aromatic content will inevitably produce higher levels of aromatic hydrocarbons in the atmosphere. However, recent studies have shown that such compounds are precursors of potent eye irritants under photochemical smog‐forming conditions. Thus contemplated gasoline changes could promote eye irritations. Lead removal is desirable. But full consideration must be given to the consequences of proposed alternatives. Public welfare rather than corporate economics should determine the direction of change. PETER SCHEINER Assoc. Professor, Chemistry York College Flushing, N. Y., April 28, 1970 • Advocacy of Rebellion To the Editor: Your April 17 editorial on the efforts to impeach Justice Douglas is as usual very apt. You call them “reprehensible” and you are right. There is, however, a point about these impeachment efforts which is of the greatest importance. What is at stake in the defense and support of Justice Douglas is the principle: is philosophical revolutionary thinking permis sible in our society? You say in your editorial that the Justice does not advocate rebellion but reform. This is to vaporize the important point in the whole matter. Let us as sume that it is rebellion that the Justice advocates for cer tain circumstances; is this al lowable? If this is not the crux of the matter, then the whole dispute is misinterpreted. But it is the crux of the matter. And to fight for its defense is to declare it as a fundamental principle of the American tradition. To fight for its defense is to claim that the impeachment efforts are a travesty upon a fundamental of American political life.

Residency Rule Asked for Hospital Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/04/archives/residency-rule-asked-for-hospital-abortions-bill-proposes-a.html,"A residency requirement de signed to keep New York City from becoming “the nation's abortion capital” has been in troduced in the City Council.  Under the proposal, to be eligible for an abortion in any hospital supported by city money, a woman would have to show that she had lived in the city for seven months. The measure, introduced by Councilman Bertram R. Gel fand, a Bronx Democrat, will be referred to committee at the Council meeting tomorrow. Council sources said the chances for passage were uncertain at this point. The local law would take ef fect July 1, the date that the newly relaxed state abortion law becomes effective. Liberal Abortion Law The new abortion law will give New York State the most liberal one in the nation, leav ing to a pregnant woman and her doctor the decision wheth er she should have an abortion. The present statute permits abortions only if a mother's life is in danger. “The State Legislature has spoken on the subject of abor tion and the debate is closed,” Mr. Gelfand said in a statement issued yesterday by the Coun cil's information office. “But the City Council does have a responsibility to make sure our municipal hospitals and our splendid voluntary hospitals, which city funds help support, are operated for the benefit of the residents of New York City.” A residency requirement is needed, Mr. Gelfand said, to prevent out‐of‐city women from overtaxing New York hospitals to take advantage of the state's relaxed law. “Even today,” he said, “many patients are being turned down for lack of beds and physicians are being told to delay non emergency operations as long as two or three months.” The Councilman added: “The staggering burden of caring for the residents of this city grows worse every year. It is unfair to ask our people to subsidize a hospital system which may be devoted to mak ing New York City the nation's abortion capital.” The only exception his bill would permit to the seven‐ month residency rule would be a case in which “the life, health or welfare of the patient is en dangered and this fact is at tested to by at least two duly licensed physicians on the staff of the hospital.” All 18 municipal hospitals would be affected, and the bill would provide for enforcement in voluntary hospitals that re ceive city funds by requiring the Controller to withhold city money from any private hospi tals that broke the seven‐month rule. There are more than 50 voluntary hospitals in the city, and all of them get some amount of municipal money. Mr. Gelfand said there had been estimates that New York City hospitals might be asked to perform anywhere between 20.000 and 100,000 abortions in the first year after the new state rules take effect. A spokesman for the city's Health Services Administration noted that such a law would produce “enormous administra tive problems,” but he said that the department would want to explore all the ramifications of the bill before taking an official position on it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Study of LSD Spurs Suspicions Of Drug's Link to Birth Defects,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/05/archives/study-of-lsd-spurs-suspicions-of-drugs-link-to-birth-defects-lsd.html,"The first extensive, long‐term study comparing the incidence of birth defects with parental use of LSD has concluded that the drug “must be seriously considered as a possible muta gen”—an agent that produces genetic changes In cells. “Although we cannot rush in and say we have unequivocal evidence at this time that LSD use causes birth defects, we are on firmer ground, more suspi cious, than ever before,” said Dr. Cheston M. Berlin, a prin cipal investigator in the study. Dr. Berlin, a pediatrician at George Washington University School of Medicine, where the study was conducted, presented his findings at two recen scientific meetings. He elaborated on the results in an interview yesterday. The issue of whether LSD (shorthand for lysergic acid diethylamide) is a mutagenic agent has not yet been resolved, Dr. Berlin said. Such agents, or changers, act in some way to alter the nor mal configuration of the genetic material within the cells of an organism, often causing the organism to reproduce itself abornmally, producing birth defects. If LSD is a mutagenic agent. Dr. Berlin said, evidence of its cellular interference might turn up under the microscope. But studies based on microscope investigations of chromosomal damage are thus far conflicting. The score now stands at four studies showing that LSD does break chromosomes and five showing that the drug does not. All previous studies on birth defects in living children of LSD users were retrospective stud ies, Dr. Berlin said. That is, the mothers, fathers and children were not interviewed or exam ined until some time after the birth of the children. Dr. Berlin's study, on the other hand, was prospective. The mothers and fathers were followed from conception of the child, or as soon afterward as possible, through delivery, her said. Offspring have since been followed for two years. The researchers found that the rate of birth defects in chil dren of LSD users, meaning either the mother or father or both, was 18 times as high as that of the general population. The investigation involved 112 women, whose average age was 19, from various hippie commune groups in the Wash ington area. The women were referred to Dr. Berlin and his team of physicians and social workers by clergymen, physi cians, adoption agencies, underground newspaper ads and other drug users. The girls were offered free gynecological and obstetric care for their par ticipation in the study. All volunteers had a history of LSD ingestion before or dur ing pregnancy. In total, 127 pregnancies were followed in the 112 women, although not all were carried to term. The spontaneous abortion rate in the general population is 20 to 25 per cent, Dr. Berlin said. Among the drug users it was 43 per cent. One very tough problem in ascertaining the role of LSD in congenital defects, Dr. Berlin said, lies in sorting out LSD from a wide range of other pos sibly mutagenic agents used by the pregnant women. These include caffeine drinks, cyclamates, cigarettes, expo sure to X‐rays, poor maternal nutrition, purity of LSD used, other drugs used and history of previous illness, including hepa titis and venereal disease. All of the subjects in Dr. Berlin's study had a history of using such multiple agents. “We can say that this group of young people is a high risk as far as obstetrics is con cerned,” Dr. Berlin said. “It ap pears that the common de nominator is LSD, but so many other factors are involved that it is hard to say it is just LSD. We have to be extremely cau tious about the conclusions we draw.” The evidence, however, is incriminating. Out of the 127 pregnancies, 62 children were born. Of these, 56 were normal and 6 were abnormal. Abnor malities included damage to the central nervous system, brain damage and congenital emputations. Such abnormalities in the general population occur at rate of 6 in 1,000, Dr. Berlin said. Among drug users it oc curred in 6 in 62, about 18 times as high as might be expected. At least one of the mothers continued taking LSD right through her pregnancy. The one case, only the father had taken LSD around the time of conception. All the other pregnancies ended in abortion, either spon taneous abortion or in hospital abortions. Nearly half of the embryos that the doctors were able to recover and analyze were deformed. In addition, Dr. Berlin said, problems arose later when some of the women tried to have more children or to get pregnant again. Twelve girls returned to the clinic express ing the wish to get pregnant. Of these, eight have not been able to do so, suggesting they may be sterile, Dr. Berlin said. Six other women did get pregnant a second or third time after having had normal babies after their first pregnancies. Four of their eight pregnancies were defective. Dr. Berlin said that the mechanism by which LSD might interfere with reproduction was not known. But there is some suspicion that the structure of the LSD molecule, which is similar to the structure of nucleic acid found in all cells may he binding to molecules of nucleic acid, thus interfering with the normal replication of cells. Dr. Berlin, who collaborated in the study with Dr. Cecil B. Jacobson, said that funds for any continued survey of the volunteers had run dry. The Department of Justice paid for the study over the last two years but has not renewed its contract. “These young people repre sent a unique and rapidly grow ing population requiring a sys tem of medical care,” Dr. Berlin said, adding that few of them were receiving any care what soever. Their backgrounds reflect middle or upper class upbring ing, history of drug abuse among their parents, high di vorce rates among their par ents and a rather high education level among the young people. More than half tried drugs befor they were 18 years old, Dr. Berlin said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EGEBERG EXPECTS AWARE PATIENTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/06/archives/egeberg-expects-aware-patients-says-doctors-must-provide-more.html,"WASHINGTON, May 6— The nation's ranking health of ficer said today that the medi cal profession was entering an era in which doctors must pro vide their patients with more information, allowing those pa tients to use their own judg ment on many things related to health and medical care. This will probably happen ""whether we like it or not,” Dr. Roger O. Egeberg, Assist ant Secretary for Health and Scientific Affairs in the Depart ment of Health, Education and Welfare, told an American Med ical Society meeting here. The classic medical position was once one of telling the patient as little as possible. A trend of the last few decades has been toward telling some what more in the interest of getting more informed cooper ation from the patient. Dr. Ege berg, who said he was trained in the latter, more liberal view, predicted the new era would take matters even fur ther. Relative Danger List He said it would be neces sary to provide the public with some kind of relative danger list. For example, it would be a hoax, he said, to tell Ameri cans that there would be three deaths among every 100,000 women taking birth control pills, without also telling them the risks of some other, much more ordinary, things. “Probably 10 times as many people have been killed by eating salt as will ever be killed by the pill,” he said. There are dangers in antibi otics and even in aspirin that, he said, cause about seven of every 100 cases of hemorrhage in the digestive tract. The doctor addressed a meeting on the population prob lem of the association's Con gress on Environmental Health here. He asked the association to help set up guidelines on such matters as abortion and voluntary sterilization of men for birth control purposes. Dr. Egeberg said it was time for the nation to discuss, deep ?? and at all levels, the over all problem of population. He expressed confidence that, if Americans discussed the mat ter and faced it honestly, they would come to a leveling of population. Present projections are that the nation will add about 100 million people with in the next 30 years. Report on Contraception In a report on new develop ments in contraception, Dr. Sheldon J. Segal said that an unprecedented number of new approaches to birth control had reached the stage of early trial with patients. Over and above the many ideas still in the lab oratory stage, he said, at least nine different modes of contra ceptive action are being tried now with patients. In contrast, the research of the last decade concentrated almost entirely on modifica tions of the hormone method embodied in the pill and in new designs for intrauterine devices. Dr. Segal is director of the biomedical division of the Population Council. One of the new methods, he said involves a pill unrelated to the birth control hormones currently in use. Its effect is to induce menstruation. It is being tried on women in Sweden, Dr. Segal said. The drug induces menstrua tion whether the woman has been fertilized during the prior fertile period or not. Thus, the doctor said, there would be two ways of using it for birth control purposes. It could be used to produce a period at a regular and predictable time every month, or it could be used whenever a woman thought she was missing a period. In the latter case, the woman might need to use it only a few times a year and would never know whether she had conceived or was simply late. The effect of the pill would be to halt development of an em bryo at an extremely early stage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Topics: Women as Chattels, Men as Chumps",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/09/archives/topics-women-as-chattels-men-as-chumps.html,"My cup of tea has never been poured from a vessel of wrath, and the brew currently being served up by the group known colloquially as “Fern Lib” is strong enough to float a crow bar or to dye white curtains the color of Mississippi mud and to give a body the pip bad enough to call the doctor.  In this heyday of odious neo logism, the belligerents have fetched up with what may be the most teratoid coinage so far: “sexism.” It is difficult to get a purchase on the exact meaning of the word, but it is pejorative, make no mistake, and among the many manifes tations of the activity it defines is wolf‐whistling: karate is rec ommended for dealing with mashers (or, if you can believe it, “sexists”) who go in for this sort of effrontery. The fustian and the hollering, the deification of Simone de Beauvoir and Betty Friedan, the strident jokelessness at tendant on the movement are woefully unpropitious because they obfuscate a good many justified grievances. There is no question that the same quantity of work should earn the same amount of money, nor is there any question that great num bers of women receive appre ciably lower salaries than men doing the same job. Unequal Opportunity In the Roman Catholic canon, one of the four sins crying to heaven for vengeance is that of defrauding laborers of their wage, and women, for centuries defrauded, are fully warranted in protesting this immorality. Nor is there equal opportunity for men and women; young women with credentials identi cal to those of coeval young men are rarely given the chance to prove their mettle—they cannot compete because they are not allowed to get as far as the starting gate. Moreover, women have a considerably slighter assurance of promotion for the same term and the same quality of service. I am most ardently in favor of reform in all of these partic ulars. I am also in favor of legal abortion, and I applaud the establishment of day care centers for the children of working mothers. On the other hand, it seems to me that if, in a good many ways, women have been treated as chattels, in a good many others, men have been treated as chumps. I have not, for example, seen any mention in the Fern Lib screeds suggesting a revision of alimony laws; if women are to have equal privilege, they should assume equal responsi bility and men should not be penalized for their half of a mistaken collaboration; they should continue to contribute to the support of their children but they should not be obliged to pay a retainer fee for offices no longer in existence. What the most hysterical and the most puritanical of these scolds seem to elide is that there is a difference between men and women, and no amount of legislation is going to alter that. To be different is not to be superior or inferior; it is not bad luck that women bear and nurse the children. Just as youth is not a virtue (despite maudlin arguments to the contrary) but is a condi tion, so gender is neither an advantage nor an affliction but is a fact. A Certain Anatomy Youth does, of course, merci fully pass, but anatomy is as certain as death and taxes. Rape, according to one report I have read, is regarded by the embattled women as a political crime. This proposition can be en tertained only if one accepts the premise that women are a social class, but the premise is too fragile to serve as a casus belli: it is wanting in history but, more, it is wanting in logic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LSD Trips May Injure Offspring,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/10/archives/lsd-trips-day-injure-offspring.html,"The doctors' case against LSD gained new ammunition last week when the results of a two‐ year study on birth defects in relation to parental use of LSD were announced.  It was the first long‐term study of its kind, involving 112 women followed through 127 pregnancies from conception, or as close to it as possible, through birth or other termination of pregnancy. Past studies on the question of LSD and congenital defects have all been retrospec tive, meaning that parents were not interviewed until after the birth of their children. In this study, all the subjects were pregnant and all had used LSD prior to, during or after con ception. As a group, these young women experienced 18 times the rate of serious birth defects in their offspring as does the gen eral population. The rate of spontaneous abortion–,‐nature's way of saying something is wrong—was nearly double that of the general population. Higher Risks It can be stated with cer tainty, said Dr. Cheston M. Ber lin, that mothers with a history of LSD ingestion run a much higher obstetric risk than wom en who have never taken the drug. Dr. Berlin, who is a pedia trician, directed the study in cooperation with Dr. Cecil B. Jacobson, an obstetrician, both of George Washington Univer sity's School of Medicine. But it cannot be stated em phatically that LSD was the pri mary villain that caused the higher incidence of congenital defects, Dr. Berlin said. The reason lies in the life styles, habits and medical histories of the women who participated in the study. LSD—shorthand for lysergic acid diethylamide—was only one element in a combina tion of things that might have contributed to the higher rate of abnormal pregnancies and births, Dr. Berlin said. These included the frequent use of caf feine drinks, cigarette smoking, poor maternal nutrition, previ ous history of diseases such as hepatitis, widespread use of other drugs and the question of the purity of the LSD. Any one or a combination of these factors could be consid ered a potential mutagenic agent, Dr. Berlin said. A mutagenic agent alters a cell's genetic makeup. That is, it interferes with the way in which the cell would normally reproduce it self. The mutagen, or changer, can be a chemical (like LSD) or an energy source (like radio active fallout). When mutations occur within reproductive cells, it is quite possible that offspring will be defective.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Paterson's Candidacy for State Office Troubling Some Democrats,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/10/archives/patersons-candidacy-for-state-office-troubling-some-democrats.html,"The Democratic State Com mittee's designation of a black man as its candidate for the nomination for Lieutenant Gov ernor has raised problems for some Democratic leaders who fear that, if he wins the prim ary, the selection will cost them the votes of many whites.  But the black candidate him self, State Senator Basil A. Pat erson of Harlem, considers the party move both logical and “about time.” Building a team of profes sional and volunteer campaign workers, the 44‐year‐old Mr. Paterson is waging a fight across the state — “hitting white and black areas, dealing with both upstate and urban issues,” he said. The question of race has al ready come up in the cam paign. Private Prejudices While some of his fellow Democratic legislators recently greeted Mr. Paterson with war handshakes and congratulations on his designation, others are privately confiding that “a ticket headed by a Jew [Ar thur J. Goldberg] and a nigger will kill the party.” Some conservative Demo crats in the Buffalo area are circulating the rumor that black militants would assassinate M Goldberg, should the Democrat win, in order to make Mr. Pat erson the state's top executive. Mr. Paterson has clashed ver bally with Jerome A. Ambro, who is also seeking the Demo cratic nomination for Lieutenan Governor, over the issue of race in the campaign. The Supervisor of the Town of Huntington, Mr. Ambro has said he would reject any sup port offered to him “merely be cause I am white and added that “bigots” should “stay home” on primary day. A few days later Ur. Pater son said he thought Mr. Ambro “protesteth a little too much.” “Every time he made a state ment he raised the issue of race even when he asked bigots to stay home,” he added. Earlier, the Harlem State Sen ator has said, in an interview that “there are people in the Democratic party — important people—who still believe that the voters of this state are es sentially bigoted, backward and alienated — I don't believe this.” Mr. Paterson's selection by Democratic delegates in early April came during a tumultu ous meeting at Grossinger's in upstate New York and followed organized pressure moves by black delegates in his behalf. The Harlem lawyer‐politician then called for “an open prim ary,” and Mr. Ambro won a place on the primary ballot by getting 25 per cent of the dele gate votes. Mr. Paterson began his cam paign at once. During a speech to the Vil lage Independent Democrats in Manhattan, he said he wanted to show state officials now in power that, “the illiterate, the addicted, the inadequately housed and fed and those who are crammed and humiliated in the inadequate facilities that pass for public transportation in this state are not just num bers — they are people.” “It's time,” he added, “that some of the fat cats in Albany were forced to come face to face with what it really means to shake the corn flakes box in the morning to be sure that all the roaches are out.” Story‐Book Candidate “The most overlooked part of being a legislator is the re quirement to lead,” Mr. Pater son added, in the interview “You must help to mold public opinion by giving more and ac curate facts. You must read discuss, listen and stay in formed.” For him, staying informed means attending several com munity meetings a week, main taming an office for his Harler constituents on West 116th Street, and teaching two cour ses — history and political sci ence — at the State Universi ty's New Paltz branch. To his admirers, Mr Paterson — the Harlem‐born son of an eltcro‐plater who emigrated to the United States from Grena dtain, the West Indies — is almost a story‐book candidate: handsome, articulate, well‐read in current affairs, poetry and religion. Mr. Paterson also has some political enemies, but foes ques tioned recently sounded quite like his friends. “We disagree on many things,” one Harlem activist said. “He has a faith in the law, in the system and in whites —I don't. I think he's honest however, and I respect that.” Another admitted enemy, a politician, sighed deeply to em phasize his perlexity and de clared: “What can I tell you? He works harder than most of us, so he does more. He's sort of spartan, you know — doesn't drink or smoke — and I sup pose he shouldn't be running for Lieutenant Governor—may be Governor.” Asked for his own self‐evalu ation, Mr. Paterson reflected for a few seconds, and with a wide grin, said: “I'm sly, devious, oily and slick. I dress like a pimp and developed a good memory by hustling numbers in Harlem.” Until recently, Mr. Paterson had only the loosest of con nections with established politi cal clubs and leaders in Har lem. His route to the State Senate — he was elected in 1965 — stemmed primarily from his work as a lawyer activist in the Harlem branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Mr. Paterson was elected and also directed two major president of the branch in 1962 voter registration drives in the Harlem area. Tension in Alliance Mr. Paterson was vocal in favor of a civilian review board for the New York Police De partment, he opposed Colum bia University's plan to build a gymnasium in Morningside Park and he supported abortion reform. When black legislators pro posed a man last year to run for Mayor of New York City, they chose Senator Paterson. Likewise, they backed him as a candidate for Lietenant Gov ernor. Talking to a black, assembly man, Paterson recently urged him to work closely with a white political leader although the two had not always been friendly. “You can work with him, can't you?” Mr. Paterson asked. Then, seeing the doubt in the Assemblyman's face, the State Senator went on, evenly: “Well you can work with him through June, can't you?” (The primary election is June 23.) Douglas Pugh, a former pro gram advisor on urban affairs for the Ford Foundation, is Mr. Paterson's campaign manager. He heads a racially mixed team of workers in the Gold berg‐Paterson headquarters at 200 East 41st Streeet. Eric Swaby, who has worked in the candidate's election cam paigns since he won the N.A.A.C.P. office, travels with the Senator and coordinates his speaking engagements. According to Mr. Pugh, the plans are to conduct a joint campaign with the Goldberg workers. While some funds are expected from the Democratic party, he said, additional fund raising drives will be conducted for Mr. Paterson in both the white and black communities. Mr. Paterson shrugs off inti mations that he might not ex pect to win in the primary and then in the general elec tion, or that he might have a greater interest in the celebrity of bring the first black man to win a major party's nomina tion for statewide office in New York. “I'm serious,” he told a friend. “I'm not playing games — I'm no sacrificial lamb. I'm out to win.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Advertising:,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/10/archives/advertising-lifelook-battle-ends-but-war-goes-on.html,"The big numbers war be tween Life and Look is over. The winner? At the moment no one knows. If circulation figures mean victory then it's Life with a big, fat 8.5 million. But if it's advertising pages, then in the long run Look, which is retreating from 7.75 million to a prepared position of 6.5 million and pulling its ad rates down to match, might well come out ahead. It was quite a war while it lasted and once included the late Saturday Evening Post among the combatants. As peace comes, however, there is increasing talk about the future of mass general audience magazines faced by the onslaught of TV and the specialty magazines with their select audiences. There are a couple of bright lights for the big books and one is the recently announced landmark study done by General Foods, Life', Look and the Reader's Digest that showed magazines can provide “an effective selling vehicle, one that is generally comparable with television.” Television is the real enemy. • “The Look‐Life confronta tion has been overplayed,” said J. Garry Valk, Life's publisher. “The real fight is with television. We both have substantial hunks of the magazine pot and what we have to do is make inroads into television expenditures.” “Look cannot prosper and make a living feeding off Life business,” said Thomas R. Shepard Jr., the publisher of Look. Don't be fooled by those conciliatory tones—they're a pair of scrappers. But it is television, that unintentionally provides the other bright light for mass magazines. Because now as never before advertisers are grumbling about the costs, “clutter” and programing on TV. A very dark cloud hangs on the horizon though, and it is one for all publishers— a possible massive postal in crease that would add mil lions of dollars to the esca lating costs of the big boys, most of whose circulations are by mailed subscription. It isn't a cost that can readily be passed to the reader because of long‐term contracts. But let's get back to that circulation war, a war that really got hot after World War II. In 1949, Life, with a circu lation of more than five million had already pulled ahead of The Post, once the country's leading national advertising medium, which was still ahead of Look—4 million to 3 million. And those are the one‐two‐three positions they held for at least a decade. There was an important development in 1953–54 and that was the publication by Alfred Politz, an independ ent researcher, of a major study of magazine audiences. Suddenly a new demension was added to the war—not just how many copies are sold, but how many people see each copy. By today, the costs of reaching that total audience, or at least every thousand of that audience, is the way advertising buys are rated. In an audience battle Life, the weekly news picture magazine, could easily run rings around the weekly Post, with its long stories and articles. Audience de pends on a magazines' pass along, and Look, which has always been a bi‐weekly, had an extra week's life to get passed around in. So editorial content can affect circulation figures, but it can affect audience even more. Speaking to professional editors these days, one finds that the general feeling is that Look has the most edi torial direction. “Life is so confused and erratic it can't be pinned down,” said one, who added, “Look is for the audience they are trying to sell— slicker, younger and pseudo liberal.” “Look has been better for some time,” said another. “It deals better with the prob lem of giving people what they can't get anyplace else, analysis, prediction and ex planation of what it all means.” “We know where we are going.” said William B. Arthur, Look's editor, who noted that for some time now the magazine has been directing itself toward city readers. He added: “We speak to one reader at a time. He is better edu cated and concerned about the world and his community and wants to do something about it, so reasonable al ternatives are put before him so he can choose a course of action.” • Ralph Graves, managing editor of Life, was out of town last week but he's already stated his position in speeches. He's for more pic tures and less text and he wants to go after subjects that are in the front of people's minds (though not necessarily on front pages) such as ecology, the Black Panthers, abortion and in flation. He calls it the “news that's in the air.” He wants more on the current Ameri can scene and he wants to report on achievements and accomplishments rather than just on troubles. And troubles for Life in the circulation war came in 1963, when Look, which had passed The Post in 1961, moved into the number one spot. The figures were 7.49 million to 7.17 million. And, oh, how Look rubbed it in. It ran ads with head lines such as, “Look Is Bigger Than Life” and to at least one publisher — ob server they seemed to throw a lot of promotional weight into the Greenwich, Conn., area where not only a lot men, but also a lot of top Time, Inc., executives live. • It was this sort of goading, several publishers thought, that led Life into taking what they consider a major tactical misstep—the pur chase of 1.3‐million sub scribers in 1968 from the fast‐failing Post. “Life got tired of having its face pushed into it,” one said. “It was a matter of corporate ego,” another de clared, while a third said, “Life underestimated the costliness of the buy. They failed to properly evaluate what the advertising fra ternity was looking for. Bigness wasn't the answer.” So Life now has a circu lation of almost 8.6 million and an estimated audience of 37 million, which few TV shows can match, and al though its cost per thousand can be compared with TV, advertisers have seemed to balk at a price tag of $64,200 for a print page even in color. Working for it, how ever, is the fact that as news‐oriented weekly it has a much later advertising deadline than monthly mag azines, which makes it ideal for mass marketers who have a sudden change of marketing or advertising strategy. Look's circulation cut, ef fective next October, is aimed at concentrating 80 per cent of its circulation into the country's top 60 markets. A few weeks before the an nouncement, Cowles Commu nications, publisher of the magazine, announced it was cutting the activity of the door‐to‐door salesmen who were selling subscriptions, because of Washington pres sure. That might have hastened the move, Mr. Shepard said, but it was long in the works. The major markets are where most advertisers want to be and that's where the magazine wants to be. Both Look and Life have been slipping in a very im portant sales area for some time. That's the sales from newsstands. It's a figure that many advertising agency me dia men use to judge the vi tality and real reader inter est in a magazine. In 1949 when Life's total circulation was just over 5.3 million, over 1.9 million of those cop ies were sold at the cover price. For Look it was 1.29 million out of just over 3 million. Last year, however, of Life's 8.59 million only 275, 296 were sold from the stands and 302,000 of Look's 7.8‐million. • Life's cover price is 40 cents and Look's 50, but there are introductory sub scription offers that can pull the per copy cost to a dime or less. Of the 2.582.754 to tal subscriptions sold by Look during the six month's ending last Dec. 31, just over half were sold at re duced prices. During the pre vious six months Life sold total of 2,780,938 with 2, 304,434 going for reduced prices. Despite sagging ad‐page figures, one finds these days a general optimism among the major publishers. They think that print advertising is being rediscovered. If the publishers of the mass‐circulation magazines have problems, and there are those that say they have really serious problems, may be time will help solve them. Money helpts, too. Ime, Inc., had 1969 revenues of $618, 489,000 and a net income of $23,916.000, while Cowles had revenues of $171,176, 000 with a net loss after ex traordinary items of $1,853, 000. “Life has all the money in the world, Look hasn't,” said one publisher. “Life has the time to solve the prob lem.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
‘I Didn't Burn My Bra’,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/10/archives/i-didnt-burn-my-bra-i-didnt-burn-my-bra.html,"OPEN letter to: Eve, Cle opatra, Helen of Troy, Salome, Juliet, Mme. DuBarry, Mata Hari, Scarlett O'Hara, Lorelei Lee, Amber, Candy, Camille, Mar guerite from “Faust,” Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. Girls, you're out. You're sexists, and you won't do. Those silly feminine wiles you've practiced over the centuries are old hat, not with it, gone with the wind. You Aunt Tabbies simply haven't got what it takes to be women today — catch you at consciousness‐raising, bra burning, socking men on the street when they whistle. But then, none of you have had the advantage of “Mod Don na,” the new Women's Lib eration musical, to point out to you the errors of your feather‐brained ways. Let me fill you in. “Mod Donna” is all about Penis Power, a subject you girls have dealt with plenty, in your submissive style. But nowadays, who'd cough her life away, drink a deadly po tion, or fall on an asp for a man? We fight. We push for abortion reform, equal pay, better divorce laws, the right to get served at Sardi's bar without a male escort. Don't mistake me, girls. “Mod Donna” is certainly no handbook of women's lib ways. It wouldn't tell you, Eve, what you need to know about co‐immunity property rights; nor you, Candy and Amber, about the virtues of the pill. No, “Mod Donna's” theme is more basic. It deals with exploitation — the way men exploit women by mak ing them sexual objects; the way women learn to exploit back by the technique of cas tration. It concerns, in the words of Joe Papp. “Donna's” heroic producer, “the use of sex as the ultimate weapon.” The plot is, announcedly, soap opera, acted out by four main characters—Chris & Jeff & Donna & Charlie. There's also a Greek‐type chorus flinging itself about in pants and no bras as it com ments on the action like a witchy sisterhood. And there's what to comment on. Jeff and Chris, a rich couple, decide to play threesies with Donna, a luscious—but more gifted—Barbie doll. Though married to Charlie, one of Jeff's employes, Donna gives —at the office, at home, at the beach—because, as she puts it, “I can't bear to say no when they ask me so po litely.” Jeff and Chris lure her into their bed and board and, eventually, into having the baby (courtesy Jeff) that Chris wants but can't be bothered birthing. The denouement occurs when Chris and Jeff, bored with the game, decide to make tracks for Europe. They try to buy Donna off with a check, a sojourn in their house and the use of their gynecologist. But, great with child, the victim is no longer a loser, and she refuses. Just as she is about to pronounce her emancipation from the P.P.S. (Penis Power Struc ture), Charlie kills her in a fit of sexual rage. * “Donna” has its funny mo ments. One occurs when Charlie arrives, early on in the game, to fetch Donna home. They fight, and Char lie pins her down. Flushed with sexual triumph, he crouches over her and Donna asks, “Do you want some coffee, Charlie? English muf fins? American cheese?” And the overworked chorus, busy as a clutch of sorority cheer leaders on Homecoming weekend (but looking like the boys from “Oliver”) bursts into “Food is Love,” one of the show's few amusing songs. The chorus, in fact, com ments not only on the action, but on other exploitations— war, air pollution, Madison Avenue, TV commercials: They dwell a little, too, on the unnatural sex practices men subject them to, none of which they like. As a mat ter of fact, they don't seem to care much for natural sex practices — which you girls, if you'd spent less time in bed and more on the couch, might learn to question, too. The one great scene—and if the rest of the play could only live up to it!—occurs when the chorus deploys it self like odalisques in a se raglio, to chant a sardonic tale of a maiden's defloration by Arab princelings. Out of Bocaccio by Olympia Press, it deservedly brought down the house. But most of the material is atrociously amateur, the acting boringly crude. Every one's a victim in “Mod Don na”—including the audience. Its worst fault—if you'll ex cuse me, girls—is that it yaks it up so strenuously. In its grandiose ambitions, it achieves the depth—and con fusion—of a woman's hand bag. In fact, I'm left with an uneasy feeling that it will do the Women's Lib movement— which I wholeheartedly sup port—more harm than good. In the manner of a cheap, topical Broadway musical, it exploits women by exploiting the theme of their exploita tion. I congratulate Myrna Lamb, the author, however, and Susan Hulsman Bingham, the composer, for getting this material off their — well, chests, and for getting a man to produce it. It didn't make me want to burn my bra— but it did send me back to those early women's libbers who said it all so much bet ter: Ibsen and Shaw.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Looking Beyond The Pill,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/10/archives/looking-beyond-the-pill.html,"WASHINGTON—The era of chemical birth control is about to enter its second decade with the prospect that it will be as far differ ent from the first as that span was from all the ages that went before. The first decade may be dated from July, 1960, when the Food and Drug Admin istration first authorized a drug to be sold for contra ceptive purposes. The drug acted by suppressing ovula tion and all of the many birth control pills on the market today act the same way. Now many alternatives to that approach to birth con trol are already in the ad vanced stage of study called clinical research — the stage at which they are tried in human beings. It would be a reasonable guess that at least some will become available for generar use within the next few years. Scientists and public health experts see a great need for alternatives. Some have raised doubts about the safety of the current hor mone pills when used by mil lions of women for long pe riods of time with little med ical supervision. Moreover, many specialists see a need for methods of birth con trol as effective as the pills, but simpler, cheaper and with less general effects on the user's body. At a medical meeting here last week, a nationally known expert listed nine fun damental approaches to birth control that are already in the advanced research stage. “That's not just a list of some scientist's daydream of what might be possible, but a list of things that have actually reached the stage of clinical investigation,” said Dr. Sheldon J. Segal, direc tor of the biomedical division of the Population Council. Some of the new methods are based on chemistry, some on mechanical means, some on a combination of the two. Several of the new alterna tives focus the birth control effort on the male, often neg lected in previous research. For example, one method being tested extensively in Korea is related to the sim ple operation commonly used to sterilize men permanent ly. But the new method ap pears to be simpler and has one other great advantage. It is not permanent. The con ventional operation is to cut the bas aeferens, the tube that carries sperm from the organ where they are made to the gland where they are stored. In the new method, a short thread of some material such as silk is inserted in the tube. Why it works is not entirely clear, but the sperm that get by this minor ob stacle often end up without their heads, or otherwise damaged so that they can no longer fertilize the fe male egg. The thread is an chored from the outside and can be removed simply. Study so far shows that it does not harm the tube. One of the new methods being tested in women in volves a drug, but its action suggests that the women might have to take it only a few times a year. The drug is unrelated to the birth con trol hormones currently in use. Dr. Segal said its effect is to induce menstruation whether or not the woman has been fertilized during the prior period of fertility. Thus there could be two ways of using it for birth control purposes. It could be used to produce a period at a reg ular and predictable time ev ery month; or it could be used only in those months when the woman thought she period. A woman who chose the latter method might have to take the drug only a few times a year and would nev er know whether she had conceived or was simply late. The effect of the drug would halt development of an embryo at an extremely early stage. Altogether, the nine new modes of contraceptive ac tion include three that in volve the male and are aimed at preventing sperm from be coming effective or at pre venting delivery of the sperm. The six that involve the woman include a method of sterilization that could be done chemically without sur gery; chemical methods of causing abortion as late as 22 weeks after conception in one method, and several new approaches to contra ception, some of which would be used continually or inter mittently while others would be used only after inter course. Some of the methods for both men and women involve Implanting capsules contain ing a contraceptive drug un der the skin so that small amounts would diffuse grad ually into the circulation. In one method of this type. Dr. Segal said, a woman could get a year's worth of contraception with one visit to her doctor. If she were to take the same type of drug by mouth it would re quire a pill a day all year. A new version of the in trauterine device, also under clinical study, appears to work by a combination of chemical and mechanical ef fects. It contains copper, which is believed to prevent pregnancy by preventing the fertilized egg from becoming implanted in the lining of the womb. Because the de vice is smaller and differ ent in design from conven tional models, it appears to be better tolerated and less easily ejected, the doctor said. Dr. Segal told the Ameri can Medical Association's meeting on the population problem that several of the new methods may reduce medical anxieties concern ing the potential ill‐effects of the current hormone birth control pills. Variations in ways of using the nine basic concepts raise the total of new ideas that are under advanced study to at least 15. While advanced research during the past decade was limited almost exclusively to varia tions on the hormone drugs currently on the market and on new designs for intra uterine devices, the new ideas are going much further. “The important fact is that both the scientific communi ty and industry have passed the phase of testing repeti tive variations on the same theihe,” Dr. Segal told the assembly of doctors. “Truly innovative ideas are now be ing tested.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Campaign to End Legal Restrictions on Abortions in Canada Begun by Women's Liberation Movement,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/10/archives/campaign-to-end-legal-restrictions-on-abortions-in-canada-begun-by.html,"TORONTO, May 9—A nation wide campaign to make abor tion completely legal in Cana da has been begun by the wom en's Liberation Movement.  The movement is a loosely knit coalition of local women's organizations, some devoted primarily to women's rights, some to left‐wing political goals. Most of the women are in their teens and twenties. An abortion is only permitted now if a panel of three doctors finds that the pregnancy jeo pardizes the mother's health. Before this change was made last year, abortions were only allowed when there was a dan ger to the mother's life. The criminal penalties for performing an illegal abortion that the Liberation Movement wants ended provide for a maximum of life imprisonment, although a federal law enforce ment officer said the usual sen tence was one to two years. The Liberation Moveent contends that the present sys tem is inherently biased against abortion and that the grounds are interpreted narrowly. The campaign of the Libera tion Movement has been high lighted by a cross country mo tor caravan of about 50 young women from Vancouver who have been holding rallies along the way. Together with women from Toronto and other parts of Canada, they converged on Ottawa today for a Mother's Day weekend of rallies. So far the campaign has re ceived a cool response from of ficials in Ottawa, the press, television and the public. One reason may be the mili tant tone, Three Cabinet of ficers were informed some weeks ago that there would be a rally on Parliament Hill and their presence was wanted, John H. Turner, the Minister of Justice, refused to attend, giv ing no reason. An aide to Mr. Turner said the Minister had received an “ultimatum,” not an invitation. Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau said he would not go because he would be too busy preparing to leave on a trip to the Far East. The third Minister is away. Moreover, having broadened the grounds for legal abortion only last year, the Government has no desire to reopen the controversial question so soon. Well placed sources added that the new campaign has so far failed to generate public pres sure on Ottawa.. Among the reasons may be that the Liberation Movement speakers express strongly left wing views on political and economic issues. These state ments deter some women who are sympathetic to such pro abortion slogans as “Women should have control over their own bodies” and “Every child a wanted child.” At a panel discussion in Tor onto this week, one speaker, Mrs. Alma E. Marks, a 27‐year‐ old library assistant castigated “this entire capitalistic society” as “geared in every way to the profit for the few at the ex pense of the rest of us.” Other speakers made similar remarks. To judge from the turnouts at two public meetings in Tor onto, the campaigners find themselves preaching to the al ready converted. Promotion of the rallies was haphazard and amateurish, partly because of a lack of experience, partly be cause of a lack of funds. The campaign spokesmen have made virtually no refer ence to New York State's new, liberal abortion law, although it is essentially what they want. There are no exact figures on the number of illegal abortions performed in Canada. The Lib eration Movement says there are 200,000 a year, with 1.000 or more resulting deaths. These figures, cited to dramatize the urgency of the problem, are not fully documented and may be high. The Dominion Bureau of Statistics has estimated that about 20,000 women go to hos pitals each year for problems associated with spontaenous, therapeutic and illegal abor tions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ABORTION GUIDES OFFERED BY STATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/13/archives/abortion-guides-offered-by-state-hospitals-or-clinics-only-urged.html,"Guidelines for abortions, set yesterday by the State Health Department, recommend that the operation be performed only in a hospital or a hospital affiliated clinic. Dr. Hollis S. Ingraham, the State Health Commissioner, said a physician's office or a patient's home would not qual ify as “a suitably equipped and staffed facility” under the guidelines. Beginning July 1, a woman's decision to have an abortion, in the state may be made sole ly by her and her physician. The guidelines established yes terday are recommendations only and have no legal force. They could become impor tant, however, In a malpractice suit against a physician who chose to ignor them, a situa tion in which “accepted medi cal practice” becomes critical. Other highlights of the state guidelines are these: ¶No physician should be re quired to perform an abortion. But if he chooses not to, either because of conscience or medi cal judgment, he should refer the woman to another physi cian. ¶A blood bank and operat ing room should be quickly available in case complications develop. ¶Up to the 12th week of pregnancy, it is accceptable to perform abortions on an out patient basis in a licensed hos pital or clinic. In later stages the law permits abortions up to the 24th week) they should be permitted on an inpatient basis only. ¶Abortions should not be performed in hospital emer gency rooms unless they are genuine emergencies. ¶A licensed anestesiologist should be in attendance. ¶An abortion should be per formed after the 12th week of pregnancy only after consulta tion concerning the patient's health and welfare. Consent forms should be “duly signed” in advance. In the case of minors, he said, the consent o fa parent is a legal question, not a medical one. ¶Appropriate preoperative evaluation should be made, and recorded on the patient's chart. City Works on Guidelines The guidelines were adopted by the Public Health Council, a 14‐member unit of the Health Department headed by Dr. Nor man S. Moore of Ithaca. Early drafs, revised very little by the council, had been proposed jointly by the Health Depart ment staff and by committees of the State Medical Society. The city Health Department is currently working on its own set of abortion guidelines. An advisory committee headed by Dr. Saul Gusberg, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Mount Sinai Hospital, has pro posed a draft, but it has not been made public. Earlier this month, the di rectors of the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation pledged “every effort to provide medi cally sound abortions to those seeking them, and to make the availability of this service wide ly known among the women of New York City.” The corporation, a semi‐au tonomous agency, will assume control of the city's 18 muni cipal hospitals on July 1, the day the new abortion law takes effect. Two private organizations, meanwhile, have made pro posals of their own that go be yond the purely medical con sideration of yesterday's guide lines. Planned Parenthood of New York Cit, estimating that 65, 200 women in the city alone will request abortions each year, announced plans to se up a low‐cost outpatient clinic to he affiliated with an accredited hospital. Planned Parenthood opposed the establishment of residency requirements for abortions, though it called on public agen cies to give preference to city residents. Should the demand become overwhelming, the or ganization said, preference should be given to young peo ple, too poor women and to those with large families. The National Association for Repeal of Abortion Laws ex pressed fear that the new law would bring a “proliferation of private clinics operated by profiteers charging exorbitant prices.” The association urged “that abortions for the poor be com pletely free, that no abortion at any facility be priced above $300, and that public and pri vate agencies strive to keep the price below $200.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Are We in the Middle Of the ‘Second American Revolution’?,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/17/archives/are-we-in-the-middle-of-the-second-american-revolution-the-most.html,"ARE we in the beginning of a Second Ameri can Revolution? Yes and no. Paradox: revo lutions can occur only after they have occurred. Marx's call for revolution in 1848 was based on the revolutionary changes that had already occurred—the emergence of the proletariat. Revolution as we usually use the word means the violent effort to create new institutions to help share power among new social forces. In Eng land and in the Scandinavian countries, the creation of democratic political parties (a debt we owe the Marxists), trade unions and coopera tives all served to distribute political power to the proletariat without a violent convulsion. In Russia, the revolution occurred less because of the proletariat—a small group in 1917—than be cause of the inflexibility of Russian institutions combined with the disaster of the war. When the Czar stumbled from power in April, 1917, it was a surprise to everyone, including Lenin. (Which suggests that while we may talk about revolutions, we cannot predict them.) Revolutions do not occur because of revolu tionaries but because of massive social tensions that demand change, combined with a political establishment unwilling or unable to make those changes. That situation exists today in America. Nixon has made the fatal mistake of declaring war on our youth (through his noisome little mouthpiece, Spiro Agnew) and of seeking the allegiance of Southern whites rather than the Field secretary of the War Resisters League; author of a forthcoming collection of essays, “We Have Been Invaded by the 21st Century.” confidence of American blacks and American youth. In the short run, it is a successful strat egy. In the long run, it will prove a disaster. Blacks, Chicanos, Puerto Ricans, and youth do not constitute a majority, but they are a massive force of social energy and they are un able to feel respect for—or any sense of shared power in—the present white Establishment, made up of the military, the corporations, the conservative A.F.L.‐C.I.O. The Chicago trial, the search and destroy missions the police carry out against the Black Panthers, the nomination of Carswell, the absolutely unconstitutional ex pansion of the war into Cambodia, the failure of the Government to check inflation or to wage a meaningful war on poverty—all of these provoke a loss of confidence in the legitimacy of the Establishment. (The hypocrisy of the “respecta ble Establishment” is demonstrated by New York Times editorials demanding immediate criminal prosecution of the handful of terror bombers in our nation, while failing to demand similar criminal prosecution of Nixon and all officers of the Government who have conspired in the massive bombing of Vietnam and the waging of a war in which more than a million have died and an entire nation has been ravaged.) The Pentagon is a greater threat to Ameri can institutions than the Weathermen. Spiro Agnew is the real organizer for the violent fringe—every speech he makes drives a few more deeply concerned youths into the tragic tactic of armed resistance. The most “revolu tionary agent” of the moment is simply the war itself, which daily persuades more Americans of the criminal nature of the central Government. WHEN is a revolution justified? Is America in such a bad state that a revolution is justi fied now? Revolutions are like earthquakes. They are tragic, they cannot be predicted, they do not require justification, they cannot really be organized. Revolutions occur when they occur. They are not caused by conspiracies but, as the Russian theologian Nicholas Berdyaev pointed out, by the indifference and inhumanity and in flexibility of existing institutions. America is in a bad state now and it would be in a bad state after a violent revolution. What is the aim, beyond destroying the system, of present‐day revolutionaries? Revolu tions, from our own of 1776 through the Rus sian, Chinese and Cuban, share a common set of values: freedom, justice, wider distribution of power to previously powerless and oppressed elements of the society. Few revolutions have a blueprint of what they will actually do, and those blueprints are usually scrapped as un usable once the revolution has occurred. For myself, I favor wider distribution of power away from the central Government directly to com munities. And I favor the unilateral dismantling of our military machine, so that it cannot op press us or anyone else. (I would fear a revolu tionary military machine as much as I fear the present one.) Such an act would more likely revolutionize the world as a whole, including the Soviet Union, than lead to our facing an invasion. The large corporations need to be broken into smaller units with ownership and control vested in communities and regions. Centralization of economic or political power is dangerous to a free society. WHAT chances of success do the revolu tionaries have? On our own, very little. The central Government still commands the support of the vast majority of citizens, though discus sion of revolution helps to remind people that revolution is a very American process. Terror bombings do more to build support for a police state than for revolution, and I suspect that Government agents are involved in some of the bombings. It is possible there will be no revolu tion but that America, the most advanced power in the world, will prove unable to govern itself in any way and sink into chaos. Youths need to read less Lenin and Mao and more about Amer ica. Chants of “Ho, Ho, Ho Chi Minh” are not revolutionary. Ho didn't win power in Vietnam by chanting about Russia or China, but by deal ing with Vietnamese problems. The breakfast program of the Panthers is far shrewder than their earlier display of guns. The nonviolence of Cesar Chavez and the nonviolence of the draft‐resistance movement suggest that the com passionate tradition of American radicalism, the tradition of Eugene Debs and Martin Luther King, is not yet played out. Is the revolution here? Something is hap pening, Mr. Jones, but I'm not sure what it is. The bombings. The campus unrest. Hundreds jailed for resisting the draft, thousands jailed on drug charges, tens of thousands fleeing into Canada, black leaders shot to death in their beds by Chicago cops. Listen to rock music. Observe the culture heroes of the youth. Popular as Nixon and Agnew may be with a frightened middle America, they lack the charisma needed to sustain the kind of police state the Attorney General is trying so hard to fashion. I won't try to predict the future—just urge those of us who believe in democracy and nonviolence to keep struggling. The editor of Crawdaddy, a leading “rock culture” paper, put the thing perfectly when he said: “Agnew, Nixon and Mitchell have set to sea in a sieve.” Sink they will—nothing in today's politics is more certain. The question is whether America will sink with them. P.S. Just as I prepared to turn this in, I learned troops opened fire on students at Kent The United States is at the beginning of its “Second Revolution,” spokesmen for the New Left have taken to saying. Is it true? Is America today in such a state that a revolution—i.e., the overthrow of the present system, by force if necessary— is justified? With what would the revolutionaries replace the present system? What chances of success do they have? The New York Times Magazine put these questions to a group of commentators representing a broad spectrum of political views. Here are their replies. State in Ohio, killing four and wounding others. The military junta that rules us is in the open. The chances for a nonviolent and democratic solution—such as Congressional impeachment of Nixon and Agnew—fade hour by hour. “We must assume that there is hope” By RICHARD H. ROVERE Author of the “Letter from Washington” column in the New Yorker. SO many things are out of joint in this coun try that if they were all, or nearly all, set right, or nearly right, the changes, by what ever means accomplished, would constitute A revolution of great magnitude. None of us can know, at this point in our history, how much in the way of change is within the realm of the possible—a realm in which time is now a crucial dimension. If we go by the form sheets—election returns, opinion polls—we have to see ourselves as a conserva tive people, and getting more so from month to month. Yet the conservative powers‐that‐be are capable of at least some innovation—e.g., family‐assistance programs. And some kinds of change seem to commend themselves on an almost wholly non‐ideological basis—e.g., pro tection of the environment, abortion reform. But this seems to me about to exhaust the cate gories. Most of the rest involve struggle. Power has to change hands. Wealth has to be redis tributed. Institutions have to be junked or reshaped. Most social and political change is brought about through social and political conflict. Conflict can and usually does take many forms, one of which is violence. For my own part, I see little point in discussing violence as a means toward revolutionary ends in this coun try in this part of this century. I think I would oppose it under almost any circumstances be cause I find it abhorrent and corrupting. But even if I felt otherwise and felt also that conditions in this country were so intolerable as to justify an attempt at revolution by violence, I would still oppose it on the ground that the likeliest—indeed, the certain—outcome would be to make conditions even more intoler able. There have been exceptions (fewer than are claimed, though), but this has been the gen eral history of violence, and I should suppose that anyone in possession of his wits and able to give the matter a few moments of thought would find this conclusion inescapable. This country might benefit from revolutionary change, but the overwhelming majority of its people think otherwise. Our society may be deteriorat ing, but the news hasn't reached deeply into the masses. Of those it has reached, probably a majority blame the deterioration on those who would make the revolution. In other words a revolution would be quite promptly crushed. Before that happened, a few, perhaps many, edifices would topple, and guer rillas might make life hazardous for a time. But the more bombings there were and the more guerrillas in the streets, the bloodier the retribu tion and the more repressive the repression. This is not Vietnam. The masses may be de ceived and exploited, but political education has not brought them to the point of much aware ness cm this score. Nor are they apathetic. They are overwhelmingly on the side of authority, legitimate or otherwise, and wish it were used less sparingly than it is. And although certain outbreaks of violence—particularly in the ghet toes—may have had some value as “demonstra tion effect,” the kind of concerted violence that is revolution would bring into the streets not only the police and the military but millions of self‐appointed and well‐armed vigilantes and counter‐revolutionaries. I said—or tried to say—some of this to some young revolutionaries on a television show recently and was quickly put down as a “cynic” and a “defeatist.” My analogies were all from the past—where else can one find any?—and one of them enjoined me to forget history and “study the future.” I plead not guilty to cynicism, but guilty of first‐degree defeatism when it comes to the proposition of turning this country leftward with guns and bombs. That, at least, is what my study of “the future” leads me to conclude. BEYOND this, I conclude very little. I have my visions of what I would like this country to be and do in the world, and I think they accord with at least some of those who are in the process of persuading themselves that violence is the only answer. I am not sure they are wrong in believing there is no hope in any of the other approaches. In other words, it could be that our American situation is hopeless. But I see no choice but to proceed on the assumption that there is hope. The argument, in any case, is not closed as of now. The record of democracy, where it has been practiced in some limited fashion, is often far from exhilarating, particu larly when it comes to wars and other instru ments of foreign policy. It has produced injus tices as gross as those produced in many totalitarian societies. But it has had its triumphs, and it is the only system that I know of to be worth trying to bring to something approaching perfection. It cannot be improved or perfected by revolutionary violence. But it can surely be wrecked by counterrevolutinary violence. “We're in a right‐wing counterrevolution now” By DAVID GELBER Writer for Liberation Magazine and contributor to The Village Voice. IN the first place, this symposium is a hustle. We've been asked to respond to four cosmic questions (which insinuate that the principle threat of violent revolution comes from the left) in 1,000 words. Leaving no space for a coherent, substantiated case for views which rarely make their way into the mass media, this format ef fectively reinforces the smug cliches about “simple‐minded leftist fanatics” while giving the reader the illusion that he has “heard both sides.” Schlesinger, Rovere, Rand et al may not be very convincing either, but they are very much at home in a business‐domi ‐nated system which subordi nates human development to the production of anesthetizing (and murderous) objects. We're not. They accept the capital ist/warfare state (and the dis torted human relationships which inevitably follow) as the loftiest attainable by man. We don't. But if neither side is convincing the status quo wins another round. The Times, meanwhile, does its bit by focusing on the relatively insignificant vio lence of the left instead of the massive, legalized violence of Agnew, Mitchell, Nixon and Laird, who are busily hacking away at the Constitution. If The Times called a symposium on the right‐wing counter revolution now under way, it might, God forbid, anger Spiro Agnew. In the hoary tradition of liberal spinelessness, The Times would rather fight the left while caving in to the right. IT is, of course, revolu tionary these days to talk about people controlling their own government. Just that. Black and poor white com munities have no say as to how or by whom they are policed. Polluting the air is a sacred prerogative of private industry and will remain so as long as profit is the sanc tum sanctorum of American values. Voters don't even know what wars their Gov ernment is fighting, and, as many Americans have just discovered, it wouldn't make a hell of a lot of difference if they did. So, in the context of violent counterrevolutionaries running things in Washington, you can be a revolutionary if you just take the Constitution seriously. At the same time, the U.S., which controls 60 per cent of the earth's natural resources for 6 per cent of the world's population is the chief target of a world revolution. Wash ington's attempt in Vietnam, and now Laos and Cambodia, to suppress that global revo lution has accelerated natural divisions in American society and gives some hope that forces will emerge and unite to make a second American Revolution. In heavy industry, where real wages are declin ing because of war‐induced inflation, young workers are rejecting sweetheart contracts at an unprecedented rate. Blacks, forced to fight a white man's war, have never been so disposed to use militant tactics to achieve dignity in a white‐supremacist society. Students are refusing to live out the acquisitive roles slated for them by elders whose en thusiasm for the domination of nonwhites by whites spurred on the U.S. rape of Southeast Asia. In the past decade, millions of blacks, women, soldiers, students, prisoners, homosexuals, young workers and professionals have been sensitized to the intricate patterns of domina tion and privilege on which the American system rests. Deference to our rulers (or “patriotism,” if you will) is a vanishing phenomenon, even among sectors of the popula tion too dulled to put up a fight. All this is enough to justify the assertion that a second American Revolution (inseparable from a world revolution) has at least begun. IN case you haven't noticed, we're not living in a nice, rela tively humdrum country like Denmark where the Social Democrats tinker around enough to make life in a class‐ridden society tolerable. Those who tenaciously rely on liberalism for gradual solu tions to social crises need a strong dose of history. Liberals have been knock ing around for 70 years now without giving us a positive solution to even one major social problem of modern American society. Poverty and unemployment were “solved” not by the New Deal but rather by war and, since World War II, by the produc tion of ecocidal trash. The trusts which engaged the bul ly‐boy progressives in 1900 are more powerful than ever. Eighty per cent of Americans cannot afford the cost of a major illness. The system's answer to the race problem —integration—has integrated 1 per cent of black school children in the South since Brown v. Board of Education. Reform‐administered cities are unlivable and will get worse as long as private profit de termines how money is spent in America. And two of our last three Presidents, self avowed messengers of the liberal, humanist tradition, were mass murderers. Irving Howe intoned in these pages recently that he is “sick and tired” of those who would forsake moderate reformers like Ralph Nader and Sam Brown. In fact, we've had Naderesque muckrakers around since the beginning of time begging Congress to reg ulate big business, yet con sumer products are gaudier and less reliable than ever. As for Sam Brown, less than a month after Howe's article appeared, Brown tucked in his tail and closed down the Mor atorium business, having al ready prevented it from pos sibly developing into a gen eral‐strike movement he and Gene McCarthy could not con trol. Enough of such timidity. It is a delusion to think that we can create a decent so ciety without first taking pow er away from the private in dustrialists, generals and poli ticians who set the course of this indecent society. WITH what would the left replace the present system? The question is misleading. What is positive in the American tradition is not threatened by the left; it is daily being destroyed by the right. Or what do you make of midnight raids on Black Panthers by uniformed mur derers? Of laws which make a state of mind illegal? Another misleading implication here is the supposed dividing line be tween revolution (which The Times reduces to simply a destructive event) and the postrevolutionary system of government. In a revolution worthy of the name (such as the Vietnamese), radically ad vanced social institutions and human relationships develop in the course of the revolu tionary struggle itself. An example close to home: Last year, the radical corn munity in Berkeley converted a useless piece of land into a people's park. [Governor] Rea gan and the university's Board of Regents correctly saw the park struggle as a threat to the principle of private owner ship of land. As a result, the Berkeley radicals are up against a coordinated attack spearheaded by Reagan, who declared himself in favor of a juvenicidal bloodbath, the Berkeley City Council, which is about to purchase two sur veillance helicopters, and the more liberal University of California, which prefers to destroy the radical community with a housing policy that would convert Berkeley into a well‐heeled suburb for pro fessors, obedient scholars and San Francisco executives. In self‐defense, the Berkeley people increasingly are form ing supportive community structures: free schools, food cooperatives, democratic living arrangements, rent‐strike units and free professional services. This is not the latest utopian flight from the real world. It is a self‐conscious effort to strengthen the community for a fight for survival which lies in the imminent future. It is also a partial embodiment of the vision of the revolutionary society which inspires the young left. THE prospects for revolu tionary change in American will not be enhanced if the Government is able to murder, exile and jail revolutionary leaders while scaring millions of others into depressive pas sivity. We may have to face an indefinite period during which the only permissible dissidence will be insipid hap penings like Earth Day or privatistic acts such as smok ing dope or growing sideburns. Ten years ago, however, no symposiast in his right mind would have anticipated the emergence of a left potent enough to send one President into retirement and to dis credit (in the academic world, at least) liberal imperialists like Arthur Schlesinger, who approve of global interven tionism as long as the U. S. can get away with it. Recent disturbances at state universities and working‐class community colleges suggest that the spirit of radical re sistance is seeping down the social class ladder. It is not surprising. Lower‐middle‐class kids who attend college to learn how to feed computers also share in a culture which exalts peace, good sex, gener ational solidarity and, in general, better aspirations than flooring a Mustang. The anti authoritarianism inherent in the young left is politicized by a growing resentment against the socially destructive aims and alienating work of modern industry. This may mean that, within five to ten years, the new generation of workers will be taking over plants and offices insisting (as some French workers did in 1968) on the establishment of work place democracy and popular control of investment and pro duction decisions. That would not be compatible with the continued hegemony of weal thy shareholders and a man agerial elite. For that to happen, the left (the student left, the antiwar left, the women's liberation left, the antipollution left, etc.) will have to come together far more than it has. If these forces manage to join together against a natural target, like polluter‐warmaker General Motors (which the U.A.W. will probably strike against next fall), the revolution will seem a lot nearer—and The Times will have to call another symposium. “A ‘New Left revolution’ is only fantasy” By ARTHUR SCHLESINGER Jr. Former White House aide; Albert Schweitzer Professor at the City University of New York. THE notion of a New Left revolution in the United States—in the sense of a force ful overthrow of the present system—remains a fantasy in spite of the revolutionary stimulus recently provided by President Nixon with his invasion of Cambodia and his encouragement of action against the “bums” on cam pus. The New Left has revolu tionary dreams, not revolu tionary plans. It has no pro gram for overthrowing the system and no program for imposing or constructing a new system. For the New Left, revolution is what they term in their patois a “life style”; it is not an overarching conspiracy. New Leftists, in short, are fantasts of revolution. They see politics as theater and seek to make cautionary and symbolic points against the rigidities and hypocrisies of contemporary life. By being systematically outrageous, they aim to expose and ex plode the cant that envelops them. When their fantasy maintains touch with reality— as was once the case with Tom Hayden as a reformer and may still be the case with Abbie Hoffman as a satirist— they can be effective. Many criticisms launched by the New Left are uncomfortably close to the mark. By forcing the rest of us to take a fresh look at injustices too compla cently accepted or too be nignly neglected, the New Leftists have played an un doubted role in stimulating the national consience. But saying something like this drives many New Leftists into a fury. Their obsessive anxiety is that society may absorb them as licensed rebels and professional entertainers. Some New Leftists invite such roles, of course, and display obvious relish when offered the chance to bring their act into college lecture halls or television studios. But the more angry among them are propelled by the fear of “co optation” into drastic attitudes and actions. When this hap pens, their fantasy loses touch with reality. It has carried some of them into realms of hysteria where their gospel of love becomes an injunction to hate and they seek to verify fantasy by violence. The more literally they take their revolutionary dreams, the more they jeopardize the revolution of which they dream. If, through their cult of disruption and destruction, the New Leftists should ever succeed in turning American society into a competition of unreason, hysteria and guer rilla warfare, do these play boys of insurrection really believe that Jerry, Rubin, Eldridge Cleaver and Herbert Marcuse will bring more armed men into the streets than George Wallace, Ronald Reagan and John Mitchell? Should the New Left bring down the fabric of civility in our society and make force the final court of appeal, they seal their own fate and hand the future to the right. The New Leftists can't make a revolution, but they might conceivably make a counter revolution. OBVIOUSLY there are times and places when revolution is justified. The Declaration of Independence offers a lucid explanation of the conditions that make revolution legiti mate and necessary. But, how ever deplorable the present situation of the United States, it can hardly be said that we have exhausted nonrevolution ary remedies. Still the fashion of revolutionary talk — the fact that The Times should stage this symposium—ought to convey a warning to our leaders. For, though our internal divisions are not revolution ary, they are acute and ominous. President Nixon an nounced after the election that his purpose was to “bring us together,” but his policies have only driven us further apart. Instead of trying to bring the estranged and ex cluded Americans into the national community, he has evidently decided to accept and exploit the division and side with those he considers the majority. Instead of a politics of reconciliation, he has chosen the politics of polarization and has un leashed the Vice President for this purpose. One of the few remaining institutions of reconciliation, for example, has been the Supreme Court; to this, almost alone in the panoply of Wash ington, the alienated groups felt they could look for jus tice. President Nixon's deter mination to convert the Su preme Court into one more arm of the established order can only deprive rebels against the system of a last reason to retain faith in the constitutional process. His determination to intensify and widen the Vietnam war in spite of Congressional and popular opposition can only increase disenchantment with the democratic process. Should the Administration thus continue to make our institutions more rigid and regressive, our internal divis ions will certainly deepen. As John F. Kennedy once said, “Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution in evitable.” But also, in the words of Adam Smith, there is a lot of ruin in a country. The further hardening of the Nixon policies will, I trust, lead to an overthrow of the Government, but through elec tions, not explosions. “The New Left represents an intellectual vacuum” By AYN RAND Author (“The Foun??” “Atlas Shrugged.” etc.) and editor (The Objectivist). THE New Left does not portend a revolution, as its press agents claim, but a Putsch. A revolution is the climax of a long philosophical development and expresses a nation's profound discontent; a Putsch is a minority's seizure of power. The goal of a revo lution is to overthrow tyranny; the goal of a Putsch is to establish it. Tyranny is any political system (whether absolute monarchy or fascism or com munism) that does not recog nize individual rights (which necessarily include property rights). The overthrow of a political system by force is justified only when it is di rected against tyranny: it is an act of self‐defense against those who rule by force. For example, the American Revo lution. The resort to force, not in defense, but in viola tion, of individual rights, can have no moral justification; it is not a revolution, but gang warfare. No revolution was ever spearheaded by wriggling, chanting drug addicts who are boastfully antirational, who have no program to offer, yet propose to take over a nation of 200 million, and who spend their time manufactur ing grievances, since they can not tap any authentic source of popular discontent. PHYSICALLY, America is not in a desperate state, but intellectually and culturally she is. The New Left is the product of cultural disintegra tion; it is bred not in the slums, but in the universities; it is not the vanguard of the future, but the terminal stage of the past. Intellectually, the activists of the New Left are the most docile conformists. They have accepted as dogma all the philosophical beliefs of their elders for generations: the notions that faith and feel ing are superior to reason, that material concerns are evil, that love is the solution to all problems, that the merg ing of one's self with a tribe of a community is the noblest way to live. There is not a single basic principle of to day's Establishment which they do not share. Far from being rebels, they embody the philosophic trend of the past 200 years (or longer): the mysticism ‐ altruism ‐ collectiv ism axis, which has dominated Western philosophy from Kant to Hegel to James and on down. But this philosophic tradi tion is bankrupt. It crumbled in the aftermath of World War H. Disillusioned in their col lectivist ideals, America's intellectuals gave up the in tellect. Their legacy is our present political system, which is not capitalism, but a mixed economy, a precarious mixture of freedom and controls. In justice, insecurity, confusion, the pressure‐group warfare of all against all, the amorality and futility of random, prag matist, range‐of‐the‐moment policies are the joint products of a mixed economy and of a philosophical vacuum. There is a profound discon tent, but the New Left is not its voice; there is a sense of bitterness, bewilderment and frustrated indignation, a pro found anxiety about the intel lectual‐moral state of this country, a desperate need of philosophical guidance, which the church ‐ and ‐ tradition bound conservatives were never able to provide and the liberals have given up. Without opposition, the hoodlums of the New Left are crawling from under the intel lectual wreckage. Theirs is the Anti‐Industrial Revolution, the revolt of the primordial brute—no, not against capital ism, but against capitalism's roots—against reason, prog ress, technology, achievement, reality. VITHAT are the activists after? Nothing. They are not pulled by a goal, but pushed by the panic of mindless terror. Hostility, hatred, de struction for the sake of de struction are their momentary forms of escape. They are a desperate herd looking for a Führer. They are not seeking any specific political system, since they cannot look beyond the “now.” But the sundry little Fiihrers who manipulate them as cannonfodder do have a mongrel system in mind: a statist dictatorship with com munist slogans and fascist policies. It is their last, fran tic attempt to cash in on the intellectual vacuum. Do they have a chance to succeed? No. But they might plunge the country into a blind, hopeless civil war, with nothing but some other prod uct of antirationality, such as George C. Wallace, to oppose them. Can this be averted? Yes. The most destructive influence on the nation's morale is not the young thugs, but the cyn icism of respectable publica tions that hail them as “idealists.” Irrationality is not idealistic; drug addiction is not idealistic; the bombing of public places is not idealistic. What this country needs is a philosophical revolution— a rebellion against the Kan tian tradition—in the name of the first of our Founding Fa thers: Aristotle. This means a reassertion of the su premacy of reason, with its consequences: individualism, freedom, progress, civilization, What political system would it lead to? An untried one: full, laissez‐faire capitalism. But this will take more than a beard and a guitar. “Dissolution before decay!” By PAUL COWAN Former Peace Corps member; author of “The Making of an Un‐Am",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

rican.” I'M writing this a few hours after the Ohio National Guard murdered four students at Kent State; a few days after President Nixon incited such violence by calling students “bums,” announced the in vasion of Cambodia, resumed the bombings of North Viet nam. New declarations of war on two fronts, a redeclaration of war on one. Who knows what will have happened by the time this is printed? We got rich too quickly in this country, defined our free dom as the right to exploit others, replaced our cultural and moral roots with a crazed desire to chase the big buck. We prided ourselves on an un defeated, untied, unscored upon war record, lost all per sonal feeling for what it's like to be devastated. We decided that our affluence was willed by God and immunized ourselves to the complexity and tragedy of life, the suf fering of others. I have serious doubts about presenting a fuller, reasoned argument here. Are there words that will persuade you that The New York Times, Time and Newsweek should print articles exploring the psyches of the clean‐cut gen erals who order the wanton destruction of thousands of Asians, not of radicals who respond to such provocations by fighting? That the white collar fascists in power now hope to gain total control of this country by insulting, im prisoning and even murdering young people, black people and poor people? Can you be convinced that Richard Nixon and his advisers are war crim inals who should be tried accordingly? That there are no conventional means at all by which the problems of this country can be solved? HERE are seven proposals. Some readers may have mind sets that make it hard for them to take such suggestions seriously. To me, and many people I've talked to, such ideas—not necessarily these specific ones—represent the minimum necessary for sur vival. (1) Force the United States to admit and accept defeat in Southeast Asia. (2) That means that the end of the war in Indochina—and of the war against dissenters at home— must become the absolute first priority of every American institution. Strikes can be organized like those on the campuses. Social workers can force their agencies to join clients in combating the war and its disastrous effect on poor people. Teachers and students; poverty lawyers and their clients; doctors, nurses and their patients can enter into similar sorts of alliances. People in agencies like the Peace Corps and AID can or ganize to shut down those operations. Liberal Justice De partment lawyers, if there still are any, can disrupt the func tioning of that thoroughly corrupt agency. Federal em ployes in agencies like Health, Education and Welfare and the O.E.O. can stage massive demonstrations at the Penta gon for a reversal of national priorities. Workers throughout the country can organize antiwar strikes in their unions. Such actions could in spire a nationwide general strike. (3) Also, petition the United Nations General Assembly (where the U.S. has no veto) to brand this country the ag gressor in Southeast Asia and recruit an international army to fight it in a sort of reverse Korea. (4) Impeach Nixon — then the rest of the ghostly parade of successors who have com plied with the United States' criminal policies: Agnew, John McCormack, Richard Russell, etc. (5) Force the Government, private institutions and large corporations to recognize that America's affluence is largely based on the exploitation of domestic colonies. Negotiate reparations treaties with blacks, Indians, Puerto Ricans, Mexican‐Americans. Free poli tical prisoners like Huey New ton, Bobby Seale and Martin Sostre, some of the bravest, most far‐sighted members of their communities. (6) Establish new commun ities, “liberated zones,” in cities or sections of states. There we can build the kind of humane institutions we believe in—schools, hospitals, child‐care centers, old peoples' homes, mental institutions that are dedicated to serving people. Our loyalties will not be to the piggish United States, but to people through out the world. In such com munities, we will have to learn to transcend the racism, egotism and product addition that we have developed during our lives in this culture of greed — to undergo personal revolutions that parallel the political revolution we are trying to bring about. If we can create such com munities and defend them, people throughout the coun try will relate to them enthu siastically, see them and the politics and life style they represent as vibrant alterna tives to the horrors of Nixonia. (7) Work toward the even tual dissolution of the United States into a number of small er autonomous regions. Only indispensible technological systems like communications and transportation should be continental—and those should include Canada and Mexico as equal partners with the rest of the separate North American states. In some regions, of course, people will form alliances with Europeans, Asians, Africans or Latins that are closer than their alliances with other parts of the present United States. This nation is too big for any group to govern it humanely. Few people really identify with it except in a commercial sense: they get tears in their eyes when they go overseas and hear some patriotic or popular song that reminds them of the hamburg ers or huge hunks of steak they miss. Living in smaller, self‐governing regions, Ameri cans might recover some of the roots they lost when they came to this country, recover some of the modesty. We might become decent citizens of the world. But maybe that is impos sible. Maybe our history has injected a poison into our blood stream that forces us to be violent. Then, I would rather see Kansans fight Okla homans than be part of a country where Kansans and Oklahomans are drafted into an army which forces them to drop bombs on Cambodians, Laotians, Vietnamese, their houses, schools and hospitals. My slogan is: Dissolution before decay! OF course, much of Ameri ca's ruling class will suffer if any such ideas are adopted. The Nixon Administration knows that. It is terrified by all threats to its greedy plans to turn the United States into a giant factory town and use its mechanized people to con trol this planet and space. It will try to stifle even small threats with repression at first, as it is doing now. Perhaps, when that doesn't work, there will be a military dictatorship. If that happens, the bloodshed will be ghastly. Could anything humane sur vive the wreckage that would be in store for this country? I often think that the name of the thing we are headed for is not fascism, not revolution," but national suicide. ■""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DEMOCRATS SPLIT IN PENNSYLVANIA,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/17/archives/democrats-split-in-pennsylvania-shapp-faces-casey-tuesday-in-66.html,"PHILADELPHIA, May 16 — Four years ago Milton J. Shapp, millionaire Philadelphia busi nessman, bucked the Democrat ic organization and upset its choice for Governor, Robert P. Casey, in the Pennsylvania pri mary election. He hopes to do so again Tuesday in what has been a bitter re‐run of that con test.  This time the 57‐year‐old in surgent is much more widely known. And while Mr. Casey, the 38‐vear‐old state auditor, again has the formal endorse ment of the party organization, he is having problems holding the support of party leaders. In Philadelphia, for example, Mayor James H. J. Tate has withdrawn his support of Mr. Casey and issued sample bal lots bearing the names of all endorsed candidates but him. In Pittsburgh, Mayor Peter F. Flaherty told Mr. Casey Thurs day, “I'm for an open primary.” To this, Mr. Casey replied: “‘Open primary’ is a code word for Shapp.” At a party fund‐raising din ner in Philadelphia this week, Mayor Tate prevented the read ing of a message praising Mr. Casey until Mr. Casey read it, to the crowd of 3,800 persons himself. Some Poster Problems Mr. Casey could do nothing about posters that spelled his name “Carey” or about pictur ing him third after the party's candidates for Lieutenant Gov ernor and Senator. The winner Tuesday will face Lieut. Gov. Raymond J. Brode rick, who is unopposed for the Republican nomination, in No vember. Four years ago Mr. Shapp, the first Jew to seek the Pennsylvania governorship, lost in the general election to Raymond P. Shafer. A change in the State Constitution makes Mr. Shafer the last Pennsyl vania governor to be prohib ited from seeking a second con secutive term. Mr. Shapp, who did not seek the party endorsement, has dipped liberally into his private fortune but has not spent near ly the $1.4‐million he laid out in winning the 1966 primary by 50.000 votes out of 1,150,000 cast. He has campaigned against bossism and has repeatedly noted that Mayor Tate said before an endorsement was made that Ile would back Mr. Casey “if he behaves himself.” Two months ago Mr. Casey, apparently tired of hearing this story, said that if elected “I will run the state, not Tate.” Later the same day Mayor Tate, who had been instrumen tal in gaining the endorsement for Mr. Casey, declared him self for an open primary, which Mr. Shapp had been urging. The Mayor withdrew his sup port for Mr. Casey and told party workers to shift their em phasis to other races. He issued sample ballots to them bearing the name of all endorsed candi dates except Mr. Casey. Later he praised Mr. Shapp's “understanding of the urban crisis.” Something Above Loyalty Mr. Casey, a Scranton law yer, frequently calls for party loyalty and says he is fighting “for the very survival” of the party in view of Shapp pledges to reform it. But Mr. Flaherty, who over turned the party organization to become Pittsburgh Mayor last year, says that Mr. Shapp has been “in the streets of Pittsburgh” to address himself to the issues more than has Mr. Casey. He says that is more important than party loyalty. Mayor Flaherty made his “open primary” comment to Mr. Casey at a Pittsburgh shopping mall on Thursday. Earlier in the week the Mayor ordered Pittsburgh's 6,700 employes to remain on the job all day Tuesday. Under Joseph M. Barr, national com mitteeman who preceded Mr. Flaherty as Mayor, city em ployes took Election Day off to seek votes for organization endorsed candidates. Some labor leaders who sup ported Mr. Shapp in 1966 de serted him this time because he backed Senator Eugene Mc Carthy for President over Vice President Humphrey in 1968. Others have endorsed him. So have such liberal organizations as Americans for Democratic Action and the New Democratic Coalition. In addition to his independ ence from the established party organization, Mr. Shapp has gone beyond Mr. Casey's ortho dox liberal stands on some other issues. Mr. Shapp would eliminate the state's 6 per ment sales tax and substitute a graduated in come tax as fairer to people with low and moderate incomes. Both candidates oppose the Vietnam war and deplore the sending of troops into Cam bodia. Mr. Shapp supports state legislation on the Massachu setts model to bar the sending of Pennsylvanians into unde clared wars. He also goes be yond his rival in advocating abortion reform.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dutch Women's Lib: Whistling at Men,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/20/archives/dutch-womens-lib-whistling-at-men.html,"AMSTERDAM, the Nether lands, May 18—They sit on bicycles and whistle at men. They swarm into the offices of sedate women's magazines dressed as cleaning women. They sip beer at men's bars, light cigarettes for startled customers and ask the pa trons to sit on their laps. “To succeed you must be amusing,” said 25‐year‐old Sofie LaRiviere, a trim, flaxen ‐ haired psychology student and a member of the burgeoning women's libera tion movement here. “We are amusing. We succeed.” Since its start four months ago the movement had grown into the most successful — and most endearingly mili tant — women's liberation group in Europe. Some 2,500 to 3,000 students, housewives and workers in such cities as Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Arnhem have actively joined the “Dolle Minas” or Mad Minas, named after Wil helmina (Mina) Drucker, a 19th‐century women's eman cipator in Holland. Laughter the Key “We are not against men,” Corry Ehlen, a 23‐year‐old student said in the frenetic second‐floor Dolle Mina headquarters on the Heren gracht a busy student quar ter near downtown Amster dam. “We think perhaps the groups in the United States are too serious, too angry.” “We are serious and angry also,” said Miss Ehlen, who was sitting beneath posters of Eldridge Cleaver and Che Guevara. “But this is cov ered with humor—so society will notice and our cause will grow.” “After all,” she added, smiling, “making people laugh is the best way of waking people up to the absurdity of our position in society.” Like their militant sisters in France, Britain and the United States, the Dolle Mi nas seek to destroy the image of women as depen dent, domestic figures. In Holland they press for equal job opportunities, equal pay, legal and free abortions, and the breakdown of the tradi tional roles of men and women. The first major demonstra tion in Amsterdam attracted wide attention in Europe. The militants, angry about “wolves” who stand on cor ners and whistle at girls in miniskirts, struck back. They sat on bicycles and beside bridges whistling and hoot ing at startled men. Why Not Women? “Why can't women make this kind of advance to men?” Miss Ehlen asked. “Why must it always be the other way?” In the last four months the Dolle Minas have marched into the offices of women's magazines dressed in black stockings and shab by clothes and hats. “Stop perpetuating the dependent woman image!” they shout ed, passing out leaflets to editors and secretaries. The radicals, dressed as clergymen, have invaded a synod of the Dutch Re formed Church that was dis cussing divorce. The synod members applauded and the women were handed coffee and cake while they talked about the “re‐education of men and women” so that each couple shares the cook ing, cleaning and wage‐earn ing. In recent weeks growing numbers of Dolle Minas have placed huge pink rib bons and posters around Amsterdam's public lavatories because there are none for women. They have also burned corsets beneath the statue of Wilhelmina Druck er to protest the “absurdity” of the undergarment and have handed daffodils to unwed mothers on Mother's Day and disrupted mens clubs and bars. Like most women's groups —militant or not—the young radicals have also squab bled, broken Into factions and whispered angrily about one another. One group hopes to con tinue with humorous demon strations to underscore rad ical aims. Another seeks di rect, militant action such as strikes and demonstrations. “One wants evolution— the other wants revolution,” Miss LaRiviere said as she sat in her apartment near the central station with her boy friend, Ewout van der Hoog, a 29‐year‐old gradu ate student. Mr. van der Hoog smiled. “I agree with what the rad ical women want,” he said slowly. “It is a movement for the liberation of society, not just women. You see, most of these women like men.” “They are really very fern inine,” he added, “They are really such nice girls.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Letters to the Editor of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/21/archives/letters-to-the-editor-of-the-times.html,"To the Editor: I am concerned about the suggestion of a simple causal relation between environmental contamination and population growth. This juxtaposition has been placed in the minds of the public by advertising by special interest groups, news paper editorials and magazine articles. While it is incontrovertible that the density of population is related to the potential for environmental contamination, it does not necessarily follow that the amelioration of environmen tal problems is dependent on the control of population growth. We must promptly initiate all appropriate measures to im prove the quality of our air and land without confusing this is sue with the need for popu lation planning. Of major concern to me are the overtones which appear in population programs, as well as in projects for protecting the environment, which are di rected against children. Were our people to become con vinced that children are the cause of environmental con tamination, America would face a catastrophe, for there is a danger that as a nation we would show an increasing re luctance to support programs designed for the benefit of in fants and children. Children as Resource Our children are our prime national resource. Through pub lic action our children must be protected, nourished, cherished, encouraged, and permitted to develop into adults who con tribute creatively to our so ciety, for the future of our country depends upon them. More and more one hears the ecologist equating the occa sion of an additional birth with an effect upon the welfare of adults. Such arguments pander to the “mechanistic and hedon istic” mood of our society. The concept that children are the cause of environmental con tamination is untenable. Family planning programs are essential, but the goals are to insure the integrity of the family unit, the health of the mother, the de velopment of each child to his maximum potential, and the preservation and improvement in the quality of human life. These are humanistic rather than mechanistic goals. The shocking abuse of our en vironment is hardly due to the birth of babies. The onus for the unconscionable exploitation of our planet cannot be laid at the feet of children. The economic aspects of de velopment of our resources have taken precedence over the control of waste and pollutants. It is fair now to place the em phasis on control of pollution at its source. We are in favor of family limitation as dic tated by social and economic considerations. But we cannot accept the anti‐child tones by some environmentalists and by polluters reluctant to modify their practices. CHARLES U. LOWE, M.D. Scientific Director Natl. Inst. of Child Health and Human Development Bethesda, Md., May 13, 1970 Activism at Harvard To the Editor: In response to the May 14 letter from five Harvard and Radcliffe students, we firmly support the decision of the Harvard faculty of Arts and Sciences to allow students broad latitude in the way in which they fulfill their course requirements for this semester. The academic freedom of those who chose to continue to study is entirely protected. It is our sense that the faculty decision has wide sup port in the student community. A carnival atmosphere does not exist among students: over 1,000 students and faculty have been to Washington and more are planning to go. Groups of students leave Cambridge at 5:30 A.M. to canvass factories. Canvassers are active on sub ways each morning and eve ning, and bases of student political organization are be ing formed in all fifty states. A majority of students are acting constructively and re sponsibly at a time when their conscience requires that they willingly make sacrifices in order to effect changes in Government policies. We feel that the present crisis requires that we devote full time to the problems of militarism and repression in this country. If our Harvard education has taught us any thing, it is that to realize the ideals of our society, the uni versity community must be come an active rather than a passive participant. GEORGE B. MALLORY Jr. ROBERT M. SEYFARTH Jr. Cambridge, Mass., May 15, 1970 • Call for Cease‐Fire To the Editor: If the United Nations still has a role to play, perhaps it is the forum for a call for an around‐the‐world cease‐fire. A universal cooling‐off period could provide the opportunity for negotiation and accommo dation in present areas of con flict. Even though hostile groups would be enabled to consolidate their territorial positions, the potential bene fits of such a cease‐fire should be attractive to every nation. M. P. GOLDING New York, May 1, 1970 • Pay for Hard‐Hats To the Editor: Who is compensating the construction workers for the hours without pay they're using to march up and down Broad way, to and from City Hall, raiding Pace College and attack ing students and bystanders? As I understand their con tract terms, the workers are paid strictly and only for hours on the job, even to the extent of being docked for lateness— well paid at that. TOM DRAPER New York, May 12, 1970. Abortion ‘Guidelines’ To the Editor: It seems incredible that New York State's recently‐passed abortion law, the most ad vanced in the nation and triumph of social reform through grass‐roots action, is now be ing cut to pieces by the medical hierarchy. Restrictions in the form of “guidelines,” imposed by state health officials (news story May 13) and possibly by city health officials and even in dividual hospitals in the near future, will severely restrict the number of abortions per formed and nullify the clear in tent of the law — to give all women access to abortion by a licensed physician in the first 26 weeks of pregnancy. Private Clinics These restrictions would make it extremely difficult for qualified organizations, devoted to birth control and abortion, to establish private abortion clinics charging minimal fees, which are essential if the de mand, particularly from the poor, is going to be met. The restrictions would make it equally difficult for the qualified obstetrician to per form abortion in his office within the first twelve weeks of pregnancy when his medical judgment requires it. Not only does the law make no such restrictions, but it seems gra tuitous for medical authorities to limit a physician's judgment in handling each case. Supposedly designed to pro tect a woman's health, these “guidelines” will have the op posite effect. Essentially they will drive the poor hack into the hands of unqualified abor tionists who maimed and killed them under the old law.

In‐Hospitals‐Only Rule Drafted for Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/22/archives/inhospitalsonly-rule-drafted-for-abortions.html,"City health authorities said yesterday that abortions should be performed only in hospitals when the liberalized law goes into effect on July 1. and they indicated that hospitalization would he made mandatory later. At the same time the health officials announced plans to thwart the threat of an influx of out‐of‐state women seeking to take ad vantage of the law, which permits abortions at the re quest of the woman if her doctor agrees. The statute establishes no other require ments. Formerly, an abortion could he performed only if it were needed to save the life of the woman. Gordon Chase, the city's health services administrator said he was confident that local hospitals would be ready to perform the 50,000 to 100,000 abortions that women who live in the city were expected to request each year. He said that the 18 munic ipal hospitals would be ready to handle half of that de mand, and that voluntary, nonprofit hospitals were pre paring to cope with the remainder. The suggested restriction of abortions to hospitals was the first in a series of guide lines submitted to the Health Department by a committee of gynecologists and obste tricians. The recommendation has no legal force. However, the city's health Commissioner, Dr. Mary McLaughlin, said she expected the guidelines to be incorporated into the City Health Code. That move would thwart plans already under way by a number of private opera tors to establish abortion clinics not connected with hospitals. When the Legislature re voked the state's antiabor tion statute, it did not re quire that the operation be restricted to state residents. Mr. Chase asknowledged yes terday that this presented the city with a ticklish situation. He said: “Our municipal hospitals at the present time treat only New York City residents as it is. We would expect to con tinue that policy.” Residency Rule Is Vague That belief was echoed by Joseph V. Terenzio, the Com missioner of hospitals, who said: “The city hospitals are there for the use of the resi dents of New York City only.” Both officials acknowl edged, however, that no length of residency had been established by the Legisla ture, and that it would be difficult administratively, in any case, to determine whether a woman requesting an abortion was a bona fide resident. Dr. McLaughlin, who is responsible for the enforce ment of health standards, ac knowledged that the insist ence on hospital abortions was regarded by some ex perts as needlessly strict. “Our prime consideration at the beginning is to make sure that it goes well,” she said. “We may decide later that there'll he room for clinics affiliated with hos pitals.” Under the guidelines an nounced yesterday, an abor tion could be performed on an out‐patient basis up to the twelfth week of pregnancy. The rules would mean that a woman within the first. 12‐week term could enter and leave the hospital the some day, without being formall admitted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Shirley Chisholm: Willing to Speak Out,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/22/archives/shirley-chisholm-willing-to-speak-out-mrs-shirley-chisholm-willing.html,"Mrs. Shirley Chisholm, who went to Congress as the first black woman member of the House of Representatives 16 months ago, sat forward in her office chair and suc cinctly assessed herself and her colleagues. “The difference between me and most of them,” she said, “is that I am not a poli tician, I'm a stateswoman. “I never told anybody that I came into politics for life. Therefore I have nothing to lose for speaking out against the wrongs in the system. I am basically a fearless per son, and everywhere people look to that kind of person for leadership.” In winning the seat for the 13th District, in Brooklyn, Mrs. Chisholm defeated James Farmer, former national di rector of the Congress of Racial Equality and now Undersecretary of Health, Education and Welfare. In speaking of Mr. Farmer the other day she referred to him as “the national figure”. Mrs. Chisholm not only has be come something of a national figure herself, but is also an important figure in Demo cratic state and local politics. The double role, she has learned, is a demanding one. Mrs. Chisholm, a former member of the Assembly led the recent party fight to des ignate State Senator Basil A. Paterson for Lieutenant Gov ernor. But because she is in Washington four days a week, and spends a day with her constituents in Bedford‐Stuy vesant, she said she cannot go on the road to campaign with Mr. Paterson. “Mrs. Chisholm reaches lot of people,” she said, “be cause she is in demand as a speaker, and I think Basil will get tremendous support, per haps even more than if were traveling with him be cause of the audiences reach.” She has endorsed Howard J. Samuels in preference to Arthur J. Goldberg in the Democratic primary for Gov ernor even though Mr. Gold berg is running on the same ticket with Mr. Paterson. But the argument that her sup port for Mr. Samuels sug gests a lack of enthusiasm for Mr. Paterson, who is black, “is a lot of baloney,” she said. “This is a smokescreen people are using to becloud the whole gubernatorial elec tion in New York,” she said. “The point has to be made that this year, because of new legislation, voters of this state do not have to vote for a slate in the primary, but can vote for individuals. That is why Howard Samuels can win and why Basil can win, too. “I'm not fighting Arthur Goldberg per se. He's a fine jurist, a distinguished Amer ican, but he allowed himself to be used by the bosses, and Basil almost didn't get on his ticket, as a result. “They kept saying to me, “Three Jews and a black man. That just won't go over up state.” I told them, ‘O.K.’, if that's your problem, take one of the Jews off.” Mrs. Chisholm's outspoken style has been evident since she arrived in Washington. Right off she asked that her committee assignment be changed from agriculture to something more relevant to her mostly black, mostly ur ban constituency. Since then she has taken sides on a variety of contro versial causes: women's rights, abortion reform, end ing the war in Vietnam and enfranchising 18‐year‐olds, all of which she favors. Such high visibility has led to a few ticklish situations. Because there are so few blacks in Congress, black people from all over the country deluge her with more calls than she and her small staff can possibly handle, she said. A delicate problem arose last week when she refused to appear at a “Shirley Chis holm Day,” held at her own church in Brooklyn, the Janes United Methodist Church. One reason, she said, was that church officials had used her name to solicit funds from other House members. “It was all very embarrass ing,” she remarked. Within the time span that includes student demonstrations at New Haven and the deaths at Kent State Univer sity and Jackson State Col lege, the number of students visiting her Washington office in the Longworth Building has doubled. “She can't say no,” said Mrs. Carolyn Smith, her ad ministrative assistant. At 31, Mrs. Smith is the oldest member of Mrs. Chisholm's Washington staff, which is largely female and also in cludes college “internes” (most of them white) who get credit from their schools for their work. A small, all‐white contin gent from Drew University in Madison, N.J., originally scheduled for a 15‐minute meeting, ended up by spend ing an hour as they listened to a few of Mrs. Chisholm's sharply‐worded opinions. On the war: “Many gentle men in the House of Repre sentatives have sons eligible to serve in Vietnam who are in reserve units. I know one who has six sons, all in the reserves. He can afford to get up and talk about esca lating the war. But I'm com piling a list, and as soon as the public sees what is go ing on, they may start asking a few questions.” On the lack of black in volvement in war protest: “Black people have so many here‐and‐now problems, like being concerned with getting a better apartment. It's a philosophical thing, a white man's thing.” The em ironment: “I agree with an 85‐year‐old black woman who said to me: ‘Earth Day. Polluted water, polluted air. But I'm not go ing to get caught up in that. What we need is a campaign in America about polluted hearts.’ That's what's worry ing black people.” School busing: “For years, for years, in Southern schools, black children have been passing white schools in buses to get to the little one‐ two‐ and three‐room shacks across town. Now, whites are screaming about busing. “One the other hand, as an educator, I believe in the neighborhood school. I can't see four‐, five‐ and six‐year‐ olds being exposed to bigots in other communities. It's enough for a black man and a black woman to with stand....” As one of the nine blacks In the House, Mrs. Chisholm has joined with the others on several issues, including “the campaign to make General Motors responsible” by, among other things, electing a black man to the com pany's board. But mostly she goes her own way, with the help of her two major advisers, Wes ley (Mac) Holder, the 71‐year‐ old manager of her Brooklyn office who, as head of the local Democratic club, brought her into politics, and her husband, Conrad Chis holm, who has taken a leave from his job as a senior in vestigator with the Depart ment of Social Services. Mr. Chisholm sometimes travels or appears for her, or, as she is fond of saying, “tells me when I've had enough.” After her House commit tee assignment was changed —not to the Education and Labor Committee, to which she feels she is best suited, as a specialist in early child hood education and welfare, but to the Veterans Affairs Committee,—she has set up a research project to investi gate discrimination in the veterans organizations. She also waged a campaign against the preventive deten tion section of the District of Columbia crime bill, and has urged repeal of the emer gency detention section as The Internal Security Act of 1950 which would confine possible spies or sabateurs in the event of invasion, declara tion of war, or domestic in surrection in aid of a foreign enemy. Addressing the House, she said: “Although the emergency detention section has not been invoked since its enactment, its mere presence on the books is an offense, especially to Americans of color. As I said earlier in my testimony, it was not the Italians and Germans who were rounded up in 1942, under a Presiden tial order but the Japanese Americans who were easily identifiable because of the color of their skin. “Today, it is not the Ku Klux Klan or the [crime] Syn dicate whose doors are being kicked in, it is the Black Pan thers. Skin, skin, skin color, gentlemen, that's the criteria. It makes us special targets.” Gauging Her Effect Despite her range of legis lative interests and the zeal with which she pursues them, Mrs. Chisholm's political ef fectiveness is difficult to gauge. “Two of the things she has going for her,” said a politi cal observer, “are also the two things that go against her the most—she's black and she's a woman. “The effect this has on white politicians, particularly those who consider them selves liberal, is absolutely deadly. They don't want to be labeled bigots or ungentle manly.” As for black politicians, particularly those in Brook lyn, a woman long active in Brooklyn politics said: “The same black men who supported her publicly against Farmer but who worked for him and raised money for him behind bier back are the same ones try ing to crush her now.” In her district in Brooklyn, the women outnumber the men on the voting rolls, and many people say it is among the women that she gets most of her support. Mrs. Lucille Rose, assist ant commissioner of opera tions in the city's Manpower Career and Development Agency, recalled how Repre sentative Chisholm had invit ed a group — “mostly house wives” — to the Democratic state convention at Grossin ger last month. “Shirley took them in to hear some speeches,” Mrs. Rose said, “and they were also able to see what a cau cus was like, with people going in and out of various rooms. When we left—after Shirley fed us at her own expense—we were all in ac cord: we had learned some thing about how the political machine works.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/24/archives/letters-poverty-pay-russia-and-her-jews-letters-the-parental.html,"WHITES ON BLACKS, AND VICE VERSA To THE EDITOR: Prof. Andrew Hacker (“The Violent Black Minority,” May 10) treats us to the common but farcical spectacle of the convert more vehement than the born believer—more Cath olic than the Pope, more roy alist than the king, or in this case, more Black Power than Charles Hamilton. No small part of Cornell's problems comes from people like this who have recently discovered The Truth. I sometimes wonder if those of us who are black ought not to consider declaring some sort of moral amnesty for guilty whites, just so they won't keep on saying and do ing damn fool things that cre ate additional problems. Waltham, Mass. • To THE EDITOR: Certainly not since Richard Wright's summary presenta tion of imponderables in the introduction to St. Clair Drake's and Horace Cayton's “Black Metropolis” (1945), a study of Negro life in Chicago, has the American dilemma been analyzed with the blunt honesty indicated in the pub lished excerpts from Andrew Hacker's valedictory, “The End of the American Era.” (I am reasonably sure that neither Cornell nor any other Establishment training center will abide his presence after this act of redemption on be half of Ivy League and ivory tower moribundity.) Professor Hacker has at once signaled the end of cant and outlined the beginning of meaningful dialogue. Hence serious black and white students may now clear through Hacker, or, if they prefer, get their focus from the aforementioned in troduction by Wright or his last and greatest novel of rele vance, “The Long Dream” It is noteworthy that the documentary film “Triumph des Willen,” depicting the tragedy of men being led down the blind steep of nihil ism to death through their fas cination for Hitler, led Wright to cut a portrait of the kind of native white son who re cently reverted to type at Kent State, where, coinci dentally, the bulk of Wright's papers are housed. And it did not surprise me when less than two years ago the late THOMAS SOWELL Horace Cayton and I found ourselves quoting the perti nent passage in unison: “It is distinctly possible to know, before it happens, that certain forms of violence will occur. It can be known that a native‐born white man, the end product of all our striv ings, educated, healthy, appar ently mentally normal, having the stability of a wife and family, possessing the security of a good job with high wages, but devoid of the most ele mentary satisfactions, will seize upon an adolescent, zoot‐suited Mexican and de rive deep feelings of pleasure from stomping his hopeless guts out upon the pavements of Los Angeles. But to know that a seemingly normal, ordi nary American is capable of such brutality implies making a judgment about the nature and quality of our everyday American experiences which most Americans simply can not do. For to admit that our individual experiences are of so low a quality and nature as to preclude the deep, or ganic satisfactions necessary for civilized, peaceful living, is to condemn the system that provides those experiences.” It was definitely from this profound sense of tragic reali ty that Wright was to create (during his “King Lear” pe riod on a farm outside Paris) two classic types engaged in integrated roguery: the highly complicated black father image and power‐structure cat's paw named Tyree Tucker, and the undeniably authentic white law‐enforcement symbol and vector of corruption named Gerald Cantley. At the con trols behind them stand Mayor Wakefield, Judge Moon, in deed the key figures of what we now know (through re ports on Reading and Detroit and Newark) to be the Crime Confederation. Hacker's vale dictory corroborates this base reality. New York. To THE EDITOR: At least a part of Fred J. Cook's report (“When You Just Give Money to the Poor,” May 3) abjures hope. The young Scranton housewife of whom he tells us, “looks for ward to the day when her children will be in school and she, too, may be able to get a job.” Since at or about the time of her financially crip pling accident three years ago she proceeded to have a child, and the following year an other, I'll bet Mr. Cook $62 that, by the time her young est is in school, she'll be 53 years old. I fully believe that “the average family had 5.8 members; nearly one‐fourth had eight or more family members, and nearly 70 per cent had children younger than 6.” It seems not to have occurred to either individuals or government agencies that one can rise out of poverty more quickly with no chil dren, or with one child, and that it is both possible and desirable to postpone a family until one has the wherewithal to feed and clothe them. And it surely can no longer be con sidered to be against public policy. I still think poverty can be defined simply as not enough to go around, and that if the family circle is smaller, the poverty is less; and I still think it makes more sense, so cially and economically, to pay the poor not to have babies until they have risen above the poverty level. And, while I acknowledge it is odd of me, I should much rather help people out of poverty than subsidize them in it. New York. TO THE EDITOR: As a former member of the Executive Committee of the Inter‐University Committee on Travel Grants, the American organization in charge of the academic exchanges with the Soviet Union, and as a long time student of the subject, read with great interest Ben Tzion's “On the Jewish Ques tion in the Soviet Union” (May 3). The Soviet leadership's brazen attempts to suppress any discussion of the tragic plight of that country's Jews is aptly illustrated by Mr. Tzion's references to the hys terical reactions of Gromyko and Kosygin to inquiries by foreigners, even such men as Canada's Foreign Minister Mitchell Sharp and Senator Eugene McCarthy. Mr. Tzion's findings are cor roborated by testimony of scores of Russian‐speaking foreign visitors to the U.S.S.R. Unfortunately, many of these men and women have research interests which make them highly vulnerable to the So viet Union's none too subtle visa blackmail. A single ar ticle on a subject as sensitive as government‐inspired Soviet anti‐Semitism may result in a permanent loss of access to Soviet libraries and archives. Not surprisingly, many are un willing to run such risks. Director, Russian and East European Institute, Indiana University. Bloomington, Ind. To THE EDITOR: I appreciate the motives of Robert E. Gould in “The Wrong Reasons to Have Chil dren” (May 3). In these days of the population explosion, it has become stylish to run down the joys of parenthood as well as to institute needed reforms in abortion laws. But the results, if his article is taken seriously, may be tragic. Thoughtful would‐be parents may be swayed to refrain from procreating, while those with less genetic potential will go right ahead having offspring; the quality of the human race is in danger of deteriorating. There is of course an excel lent reason for having chil dren that Mr. Gould neglects to point out. There is no other worthwhile reason for living. What parent hesitates to dis pose of all his worldly goods when his child's life is at stake? Why do parents find talk about their children the most interesting topic? Who are lonelier than a childless middle‐aged couple? All other activities are sublimations. I hope Mr. Gould's article doesn't influence couples to refrain from having children until it is too late. Of course we give up a great deal for our children; they are worth it. We give up something every time we make a choice.

Liberalized Abortion Bill Is Vetoed in Maryland,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/27/archives/liberalized-abortion-bill-is-vetoed-in-maryland-governor-cites.html,"ANNAPOLIS, Md., May 26— Gov. Marvin Mandel of Mary land vetoed today legislation that would have removed all state restrictions on abortions. The Governor emphasized that he had based his decision on legal rather than ethical grounds. He said: “The action I am taking to day is not a reflection of per sonal attitude or philosophy, but rather it is based on a thorough consideration of the merits of the legislation be fore me.” The veto leaves in effect law enacted two years ago that permits abortions up to the 26th week of pregnancy in cases involving rape or incest, where there is a likelihood of a deformed baby or when the pregnancy would harm the physical or mental health of the mother. In his veto message, Gover nor Mandel expressed the fol lowing three major concerns about the bill passed in the final days of the state Legislature this year: “1. I noted that the bill con tains no residency require ment. “2. I expressed concern that the measure made no pro vision for the knowledge of the husband prior to the performing of an abortion. Even the parents of an un married minor girl would not be required to give their consent to or have the knowledge of an abortion under this measure. “3. My third concern — and perhaps the gravest one— was that the bill repealing the present abortion law would allow an abortion, even in the eighth or ninth month of pregnancy.” The General Assembly, Mary land's, state legislature, will have no chance to override the veto because this is an elec tion year for the legislature. Maryland's constitution pro vides that a new legislature cannot overturn the veto of a administration. The decision of the abortion bill is undoubtedly one of the most politically sensitive that the Governor has made in his year and a half in office. It could have serious repercus sions in the September primary and in the November elections when he runs for a four‐year term. More than 50,000 letters, split almost equally on the issue, have poured into the Gover Decision May Affect Mandel Chances in Fall Primary nor's office. The lobbying was intense, particularly by the medical profession in favor of the bill and Roman Catholic leaders in the oppostion. The sensitivity of the situ ation was reflected in a de cision by the Governor to avoid television coverage of his signing the veto message. This decision was made de spite a promise by his press secretary almost a week ago that provision for the coverage would be made. The Governor refused’ to make a statement in person or answer questions about the veto, going immediately to the privacy of his inner office after signing five bills unrelated to the abortion legislation. His press secretary simply said: “For your information the Governor has just vetoed the abortion bill.” He said the Governor had had to leave for “an important meeting,” but refused to say what the meeting concerned. “That's his business. He's not evading the press,” the secre tary added.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Women's Liberationist Hails the Prostitute,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/29/archives/womens-liberationist-hails-the-prostitute.html,"A call for members of the women's liberation movement to recognize prostitutes as the most courageous leaders of the revolution against male domi nation highlighted an all‐day conference here yesterday to explore woman's changing role in society. About 200 women represent ing conservative, moderate and radical viewpoints toward the general concept of women's in creasing demand for independ ence were brought together by the National Conference of Christians and Jews and the New York State Women's Unit of Governor Rockefeller's office. “We're concerned about dis crimination toward all people, black, white, red or green, and women are definitely a group of people who face general dis crimination and inequality,” ex plained Lynn Brooks, associate director of the New York Re gion for the National Confer ence of Christians and Jews. The organization worked closely with the Women's Unit of Governor Rockefeller's of fice, which was formed in 1967 to promote women's interests in state affairs and to analyze the problem of discrimination. Young and old, married and single, women gathered in small groups throughout the Red Cross building, at. 150 Amsterdam Avenue and 66th Street, to evaluate the “new options” in marriage, politics, business and life styles in general. At the outset, they all met to gether in the auditorium where they listened and applauded as Ti‐Grace Atkinson, the theoreti cian of the radical feminists, sat on the steps leading up to the stage and‐ urged them to “support the prostitute” as the model of the new, independent woman. “We have to go out on the street to help her,” she said. Then, as some in the audience began to cheer, Miss Atkinson added: “There's a playgirl‐of the‐month award. I think we ought to start a ‘Frankenstein of‐the‐month’ award and I nom inate Mayor John Lindsay to be the first in recognition for his policy of harassing prostitutes.” “My impression,” she said, “is that the prositute is the only honest woman left in America.” Women are forced into a po sition of servitude and recog nized only for their sexual po tential, she explained as she sat on the steps in her black pants suit. In apparent defiance of the rejection of the bras siere by other radical members of the Women's Liberation Movement, Miss Atkinson al lowed her white bra straps to show. “The suppression of women is synonymous with being forced into prostitution,” she told the gathering, “but if that's the way it is, I say, let's not go for free, let's up the charge. Prostitutes are the only honest women because they charge for their services, rather than sub mitting to a marriage contract which forces them to work for life without pay.” Admitting that the women's revolution still needed to de fine its programs and goals to coalesce the interests and sup port of women across the coun try, she recommended several measures to help the prosti tute. She urged that prostitu tion laws be repealed, much as the strict abortion laws in the istate have been ameliorated, partly by pressure from wo men's groups. Miss Atkinson also suggest ed that for every woman ar rested for prostitution, four men should be arrested for obscenity. When the applause for Miss Atkinson faded, Mrs. Ersa H. Poston, president of the State Civil Service Commission and the highest‐ranking woman in the state government, de scribed the impact of the wo men's movement. “The psychological stirrings, which seem to be radicalizing a relatively small but vocal minority bf militants, are and have been felt, now by all American women, whether they admit it or not,” she said. “More and more women are apparently beginning to accept the notion that their present role in the kifchen or behind a typewriter has been thrust upon them by a society domi nated by men and government by masculine values, and they believe that they could be more than what they are but will never really achieve fulfill ment within the stifling restric tions of their present roles.” Betty Friedan, the leader of the Women's Liberation Move ment and author of “The Feminine Mystique,” said that for her it might mean running for the United States Senate. She told about 25 women gathered for a workshop, on the role of women in politics that she was considering run ning against Senator Jacob K. Javits in 1972 in a campaign dedicated to greater women's rights. “Men just don't understand our concern to have an in dependent role in life,” she said, “and so we can't rely on them. We have to do it our‐ selves.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"City Is Planning for Abortions At the Rate of 25,000 a Year",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/30/archives/city-is-planning-for-abortions-at-the-rate-of-25000-a-year-city.html,"The municipal hospital sys tem here has committed itself to full implementation of New York's liberalized abortion law, to take effect July 1, and funds were earmarked this week to make possible 25,000 to 30,000 abortions a year on city resi dents.  In letters received Monday from the Health Department, the chiefs of obstetrics at the 15 city hospitals with gyne cological services were told how much money they would get to help them perform the anticipated number of abor tions that the communities they serve would request. As a result of that commitment, Dr. Robert E. Hall, presi dent of the Association for the Study of Abortion and an ob stetrician at the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, predicts, “For the first time in history the poor and the poorly educated may have easier ac cess to legal hospital abortions than the middle and upper classes.” An extensive educational campaign is being planned to inform the poor of that medical service, which will be available to them if and when they need it. The outlook is not nearly so clear, however, for more af fluent private patients, who traditionally have had far eas ier access to hospital abortions than have the indigent. A survey of hospitals has in dicated that when the new abortion law—the nation's most liberal—takes effect, it will not be unusual for the pri vate patient to find that the hospital where she would, nor mally go for surgery or diag nostic tests will not have room for her if she needs an abortion. The outlook also is uncertain for women seeking abortions in upstate hospitals. Although at least one large hospital in each of the cities of Albany, Syra cuse, Rochester and Buffalo is preparing to handle its share of the burden, most large up state hospitals have made no plans to expand their present capacities to perform abortions, which they estimate will be far below the demand. These impressions were gathered during interviews with scores of doctors and hospital administrators throughout the state who have actively partici pated in plans to accommodate the anticipated deluge of abor tion patients starting on July 1. Estimates of the expected demand for abortions in New York vary widely. Among res idents of New York City, most “guestimates” range from 50,000 (one abortion for every three live births) to 100,000 year. A smaller number is an ticipated upstate. The Big Unknown It appears uncertain, indeed improbable, that any of the hospitals ‐municipal, volun tary or private, will be fully ready or able to meet the de mands that they will face on July 1. There are several rea sons: the wheels of medicine turn slowly, and the profession generally finds it difficult to prepare for a need not yet present; many of the appli cants for abortion were.., al ready pregnant when the Gov ernor signed the new legisla tion in April, and thus they will be further along in preg nancy than the stage at which most doctors are willing to abort, and because the initial demand may well exceed pres ent expectations. The greatest unknown—which has made many doctors fearful that the demand for the opera tion will far outstrip their capac ity to perform it—is how many women living under less‐liberal laws will come to this state for legal termination of their un wanted pregnancies. Many Applicants Expected Although there is no resi dency requirement written into New York's new law, the city Health Department has recom mended that priority be given to city residents, and most hos pitals in the state are expected voluntarily to require residency. The New York Times survey was conducted among a sam pling of the city's large munici pal and voluntary (nonprofit) hospitals and 25 of the largest hospitals (in terms of the num ber of babies delivered annually) in upstate New York. The survey disclosed that, in general, municipal and com munity hospitals, which serve mainly nonpaying patients, will be better organized and equipped to handle their share of the abortion burden than will the voluntary and the pri vate proprietary hospitals. The response of municipal hospitals to the impending change in the abortion law— from one that permits abortion only to save the mother's life to one that permits abortion for any reason up to the 24th week of pregnancy—reflects in part a deep concern for the pregnancy‐related tragedies they witness daily among the city's poor, in part the belief that municipal hospitals should set the pattern for good medical practice and in part the fear that failure to implement the law will result in the establish ment of irresponsible, profi teering and unsafe abortion clinics. Problems involving costs and hospital bed space may all but disappear nine months hence if enough abortions are done to lower the birth rate. The average cost of prenatal care and delivery of an indi gent patient is $500 to $700, paid for by Medicaid and the hospital. An abortion, on the other hand, would cost about $100, the Health Services Ad ministration estimates, $75 of which would be paid for by Medicaid. And the reduction in the number of births and the num ber of patients treated for com plications of illegal abortions would open up hospital facili ties not currently available. Considerable differences exist in the degree to which New York hospitals have committed themselves to the performance of abortions, and there are dis parities between the on‐paper commitments and in‐practice preparations of some hospitals. Whereas the New York Uni versity Hospital has already had a trial run of its Saturday outpatient abortion facility (de signed to accommodate 12 patients a week before the 10th week of pregnancy), Columbia Presbyterian has done little more than purchase a suction curretage apparatus for use in early‐pregnancy abortions. The New York Hospital has said it is prepared to perform 10 abortions a day, five days a week—half on private pa tients and half on ward patients. For most municipal hospitals, some of which are underutilized and have empty beds, space is not nearly so critical as are staff and equipment. The city hospital contains a $5‐million reserve fund for expansion of hospital services. According to the Health Services Administra tion, most of the money will be allocated to the city hospi tals, as needed, for the estab lishment of extensive abortion services. $378,000 for Elmhurst In some cases, the money will go toward hiring staff mem bers to treat abortion patients at night and on weekends. In others, it will be used to con vert currently underused facil ities into hospital‐based out patient, abortion units where patients up to the 10th or 12th week of pregnancy could be admitted early in the morning aborted, observed for a few hours, then sent home in the afternoon. The City Hospital Center at Elmhurst, for example, will get $378,000 for the year starting July 1 to hire extra staff mem bers to perform abortions on weekends, when their regular operating rooms are used only for emergencies. Elmhurst's thief of obstetrics, Dr. Joseph Rovinsky, says the hospital could handle up to 3,600 abor tions a year, if two‐thirds of them could be done as out patient procedures. Dr. Saul Gusberg, chief of obstetrics at Mount Sinai and chairman of the city Health Department's advisory commit tee on abortions, emphasizes that the more patients who come in for abortions before the 12th week of pregnancy, the more could be handled as out patients and, accordingly, more abortions could be done. Obstetricians' Limits He adds that as a not‐ incon sequential side benefit, the earlier in pregnancy that an abortion is performed, the safer a procedure it is. In a “hot line” issued this week by the Medical Society of the State of New York, physicians were cautioned “that an abortion performed after the 12th week of pregnancy is fraught with tremendous danger.” Several of the heads of ob stetrical services of leadinc, New York hospitals said that they would not permit any abortions beyond the 12th week unless the mother's life were in dan ger, and virtually all doctors interviewed said that despite the law they would not do an abortion beyond the 20th week of pregnancy. One doctor remarked: “The possibilty of a fetus living gives me nightmares. Before the. 20th week that possibility is very remote.” Perhaps the greatest ob stacle that abortion patients are likely to encounter is the reluctance of many obstetri cians to perform abortions of any sort, let alone abortions on reouest. “You have to realize,” said one leading obstetrician who has guided preparations for, the new law, “that obstetricians by training and practice are geared to bringing new life into the world, not destroying it. For many of us, religious objections notwithstanding, abortions sim ply go against our grain.” The experience that other states have had with liberalized abortion laws indicates that only a minority of qualified physicians are willing to partic ipate. Of those doctors who said they would perform abortions under New York's new law, sev eral said that they would con tinue to charge their present rates—about $200 to $400. Added to the physician's fee will be the hospital and labor atory costs, which will also rise with the stage of pregnancy and consequent length of hospital stay. Only $80 of that would be covered by Blue Cross (Blue Shield would contribute $40 to the doctor's fee) and only for married women with family contracts and the relatively few single women covered by spe cial policy riders. “The success of New York's abortion program will depend largely upon whether the women come in early in preg nancy—after they miss their first menstrual period,” Dr. Rovinsky advised. “An exten sive education campaign, par ticularly in the ghetto areas, is sorely needed.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Venereal Disease Rising; Many U.S. Young Afflicted,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/01/archives/venereal-disease-rising-many-us-young-afflicted-venereal-disease.html,"Gonorrhea, a disease once thought under control, is ram paging through the country, crossing socio‐economic lines, making inroads into suburbia and afflicting an overwhelming proportion of youngsters.  The alarm of public health officials over what they regard as a nationwide epidemic of gonorrhea is paralleled some what by an increase in the number of reported cases of syphilis in all but one section of the country during the first four months of this year. Syphilis has been on the de cline for the last five years and many officials expected this decline to continue. With more than one and a half million new cases each year, venereal disease is the nation's most common com municable disease, except for the common cold. The reported incidence of gonorrhea is rising at a progressively higher rate, 15 per cent in the last year and more than 200 per cent in some large cities. In a survey of 30 major American cities conducted by The New York Times, public health officials attributed the rise in gonorrhea to relaxed sexual morality; increased promiscuity, especially among youngsters; abandonment of the condom, which offers some protection against infection, for the birth control pill; great er mobility of the population; general ignorance; lack of co operation by the medical pro fession; insufficient funds to trace cases, and ostrich‐like behavior on the part of victims who refuse to name their con tacts and educational institu tions that the teaching of V.D. prevention in the schools. In some cities, the increase in V.D. has been attributed in part to better reporting of cases to the public health au thorities. (Studies have shown that the actual incidence of V.D. is four times the number of cases that are reported.) But most officials interviewed were sure that more and more peo ple are being infected at younger and younger ages. In Memphis last month, a 5‐year‐old boy was treated for gonorrhea. Investigation by health officials showed that he had had sexual relations with a 9‐year‐old girl. The girl refused to name her other sexual partners. End of the investigation. Although the case is unusual, it illustrates how widely vene real disease is spreading among the young. It occurs most fre quently among those between the ages of 20 and 24, followed closely by youngsters 15 to 19 years old. Statistically, a teen ager gets V.D. every two min utes somewhere in America. Last year in Philadelphia, 50 of the city's 13,006 reported cases of gonorrhea occurred among children under 10. And officials in San Francisco esti mated that, in some of the city's high schools, a student has a 1‐in‐5 chance of getting V.D. before graduation. Dr. Warren Ketterer, head of the venereal disease section of the California Department of Public Health, estimates that one of every 10 persons aged 15 to 24 in San Francisco will have venereal disease this year. Syphilis Rate Rises In the United States during the last fiscal year, 18,679 cases of primary and secondary syphilis (representing different stages of disease symptoms), were reported; this was a de cline of 7.4 per cent over the total for the previous fiscal year. Thus far this year, how ever, all regions of the country except the South Central states have reported a higher in cidence of syphilis. Syphilis is caused by a spirochete, a long, tapered, worm‐like microscopic organ ism called Treponema pallidum. The organism, which invades the body through mucous membranes, is spread from one person to another by direct sexual contact. The disease is not transmitted through con tact with contaminated articles because the fragile spirochete does not survive outside the human body. Occasionally, a baby is born with syphilis contracted from its mother during her preg nancy. Nearly 300 cases of congenital syphilis were re ported in the country last year. The disease often kills the fetus, resulting in a spon taneous abortion, or stillbirth. The first sign of infection in the adult is a sore, or chancre, on the genital organs. The chancre appears from 10 days to 10 weeks, but most often about three weeks after con tact with an infected person. During the next four to six weeks, the chancre may clear up untreated, but a rash and other symptoms of illness may follow. These secondary symp toms may also disappear with out treatment, and in about two‐thirds of all cases, that is the end of the illness. Without adequate treatment, however, years later about one‐ third of the victims develop generalized, debilitating and eventually fatal symptoms, in cluding deterioration of the central nervous system and se vere cardiac complications. The introduction of penicillin after World War II sounded what seemed to be the death knell for syphilis. The number of reported cases dropped from a high of nearly 70,000 cases in 1948 to a low of 6,251 in 1957. Then the Federal Government curtailed funds for the V.D. program. “That's what usually hap pens,” said Dr. William Holder of the Mississippi Health De partment. “When a disease control program reaches the point of near eradication, it's usually the program that's eradicated, not the disease.” The successful eradication of syphilis depends on the com plete tracing of all persons who had sexual contact with any potentially infected person. Last year in San Francisco, where officials interviewed 30, 000 V.D. victims and followed up their contacts, an infected woman provided the names of about 300 long‐distance truck drivers from all over the coun try with whom she had had contact. In St. Louis, a major chain was started by a 20‐year‐old woman. One of her contacts refused to be treated at first. By the time he was located, he had spread the infection to six other women; eventually, 70 persons were involved. Gonorrhea Not Traced Contact tracing is almost solely limited to syphilis. No Federal funds, and in most cases no state funds, are avail able to do the same for gonor rhea. Joe Pair of the Texas Health Department's V.D. services divi sion believes that, with 25 more people on the syphilis program, he could eliminate the disease from Texas. He thinks that he would need 150 more people to do the same for gonorrhea. There were 494,227 cases of gonorrhea reported in the Unit ed States during the last fiscal year, an increase of 62,847 over that of the previous year. Gonorrhea is caused by a bacterium called Neisseria gon orrhoeae, which, like the syph ilis spirochete, is transmitted solely by direct sexual contact. Its short incubation period— three or four days—makes con tact tracing far more difficult than with syphilis because by the time a contact is reached the disease is likely to have been spread to many others. Some Are Resistant Like syphilis, gonorrhea is readily treated with penicillin, but in recent years forms of the gonorrhea organism that are re sistant to penicillin and other antibiotics have appeared in some parts of the country. But Dr. Frank Gomila, direc tor of the V.D. clinic in New Orleans, said that “the bugs aren't half as resistant to the drugs as patients are to instruc tion on prevention.” Dr. Gomila added that he was plagued by “repeaters” who contract gonorrhea several times a year. Although gonorrhea is not a fatal disease, it can lead to serious complications, particu larly in women. When the in fection spreads through the pelvic organs, it can cause sterility. A man who contracts gon orrhea has a severe burning in the urinary tract and a thick, yellow discharge three to nine days after becoming infected. Eight out of 10 infected won en, however, have no notice able symptoms and unless they are named as contacts, they may never be treated and may continue to spread the infec tion for years. Dr. Walter Smartt, head of the V.D. control unit of the Los Angeles Coun ty Health Department, esti mates that “45,000 women in Los Angeles have gonorrhea and don't know it.” Few Cases Reported Another problem in bringing gonorrhea under control is the lack of a fairly simple screen ing test, such as the Wasserman blood test for syphilis. Gonor rhea can be detected by cultur ing a specimen from the pa tient's genital organs, a process that takes a week or more and even then is not 100 per cent accurate. But by far the greatest deter rent to the eventual eradication of venereal disease is that few cases are reported to public health authorities, precluding the possibility of contact trac ing. A recent national survey found that, although private physicians treat about 80 per cent of the venereal disease cases, they report only one in nine to public health officials. As one Memphis doctor said, “I'd be crucified by sundown if I reported a case to the health department and a caseworker showed up at the husband's office the next morning.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TV: A Frightening Look at the Problems in ‘1985’,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/02/archives/tv-a-frightening-look-at-the-problems-in-1985-metromedia-examines.html,"Taking a note from Orson Welles's celebrated 1938 “War of the Worlds” radio scare, Metromedia television and WNEW‐TV took a brave look into the future last night and discovered—the Apoca lypse. The two‐hour study of the problems of pollution—pres ent and future—was an ex citing exercise in journalistic imagination, with the first‐ futuristic hour the more in teresting and valuable. It at tempted to show through a dramatized documentary not unlike those usually seen on TV with Metromedia re porters covering a disaster— what the world of 1985 will look like if present popula tion trends and environmen tal neglect continue. It was a harrowing vision of thousands of smog deaths, power failures, depleted rivers, barren lands and smothered oceans. Famine stalked most of the underdeveloped world and food riots tore the major Asian capitals, the United States Government was seek ing legislation for compul sory abortion and steriliza tion, while large bonuses were being asked for child less couples and heavy taxes for the fruitful. The reporters and com mentators did not blink at the tough controversial, moral and philosophical re evaluations that would have to be made if their bleak vision was not to become a reality. • The major problem, of course, is that such prophe cies can become self‐fulfill ing. The aim of “1985” was to frighten and it did. But it was notably short on rational solutions on how to avert disaster and always opted for the most pessimistic projec tion of events. It raised many more questions than it an swered, but perhaps that should be accounted a major virtue. The program was frontal assault on com placency, and in terms of its limited objective it was bril liantly successful. Channel 5 reported that 42 calls—about equally di vided, for and against—were received during and immedi ately after the show. The ob jectors protested what they regarded as the program's scare tactics. A few, having just missed the opening cau tion, called in to ask if the events portrayed were actu ally happening. However, the program scrupulously interrupted the narration every five minutes to warn that the program was a dramatization and also inserted streamers in the lower portion of the screen during particularly frighten ing portions.

Letters to the Editor of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/03/archives/letters-to-the-editor-of-the-times.html,"Ruling on Abortions To the Editor: The City Health Department's ruling on New York's new abor tion law will place the city's hospitals in a totally untenable position. While restricting the practice of abortion to licensed hospitals and at the same time not confining this practice to city residents, this ruling will require fifty obstetrical services to meet the yearly demands of 500,000 women. Until now, these services have performed an average of twenty abortions per hospital a year—because of the lit eral interpretation of the old abortion statute. Under the new law, for city residents alone they will have to perform 1,000 per hospital a year which they can easily do on an out patient basis. With no residency requirement, however, they will be asked to perform 10,000 per hospital a year —which they could not do if they wanted to. This impasse could have been avoided by the Health Depart ment's exclusion of nonresi dents. A bill now before the City Council would impose such a restriction, but only upon the municipal and voluntary hospi tals—thereby perpetuating the advantage of the rich, who will swarm to our proprietary hos pitals from all over the country. Residency Requirement It is argued that a residency requirement is unconstitutional. If the demand for abortions by nonresidents could he expedi tiously and equitably met by existing medical personnel and facilities, this would be true. Since it is so obviously absurd, however, to expect one city to provide this service for the en tire country, the constitution ality of such regulation would probably be upheld on prag matic grounds. The other alternative—open ing independent abortion clinics —is equally unworkable. One half million abortions a year would require the equivalent of 200 clinics doing ten abortions a day. Such a hasty prolifera tion of substandard facilities would lead to medical compli cations, deaths, profiteering, headlines; and ultimately, our state legislators would think twice about condoning the dis astrous results of a law which they enacted this year by the margin of a single vote. Having fought for seven years for abortion law repeal, I am idealistically loathe to deny abortions to any woman. Logistically, realistically, and politically, however, I am convinced that this expedient must be adopted—at least for a year or two, until repeal is achieved in the other states. Denying re course to a few hundred thou sand nonresidents is a small price to pay for assuring proper medical care to millions of needful women in the future. ROBERT E. HALL, M.D. Associate Professor, College of Physicians and Surgeons New York, May 29, 1970 An editorial on this subject appears today. • For Tax Control To the Editor: There has been increasing comment on the subject of wage and price controls. Both are most important in the battle against inflation, but I also suggest that tax control be considered. Prices and wages seem to be on an upward spiral but taxes are literally exploding. If wage earners and manufacturers are being considered for controls, it would be a mistake not to protect them with stable tax rates. JOHN P. SWANSON Tenafly, N. J., May 25, 1970 • Mideast Confrontation To the Editor: M. T. Mehdi's letter of May 26 plainly skirts the true is sues. Let's recognize the situa tion for what it is. For reasons of self‐defense or otherwise, Egypt has con verted a dispute between two competing nationalisms into an East‐West confrontation with the danger of a nuclear con flagration. No claim of self‐de fense can exonerate this irre sponsible step. It was, after all, the Arab states that attempted to crush Israel in 1948. It was Egypt that closed the Suez Canal to Israeli shipping in 1956, blockaded the Straits of Tiran in 1967, and unilaterally abro gated the cease‐fire while de claring a war of attrition against Israel in 1969. Egypt has merely called in the Soviet Union to salvage its aggression. This claim of self‐defense is made so much more ironical by Mr. Mehdi's own boast of Arab numerical superiority. Egypt's latest threat to world peace is fully commensurate with past history of Arab in ternational blackmail. Time and again the Arab states have threatened to cut off essential oil supplies from noninvolved European states, to expropriate Western business concerns, and to conduct an international boycott against all who would thwart their designs. The forcing of a confronta tion between the Soviet Union and the United States in the Middle East is one more, though ghastly exaggerated, step in that direction, inasmuch as it is no longer Israel which is at stake but the existence of the world. WILLIAM ORBACH New York, May 28, 1970 FORCED The loose sequence of thought settles as I walk. An occasional stalk of yellow light is brought through tight‐laced branches by an edging wind. I try to catch sight of something living where shadows twist and hatch plots of light, and a sudden glare is scooped in a half‐hidden pool. But I only get a lie in every movement from the winds fanning‐out among thick‐muscled trees and am myself, in thought, forced along as by a wind un‐bidden. WILLIAM OXLEY Mortgages in N.Y.C. To the Editor: The concern of the Rent Commissioner with respect to the increased rates charged landlords by their mortgagees on expiring mortgages is touch ing. He fears continued aban donment, because rates are be ing increased to current market levels, and urges the lenders not to consider their depositors, but the housing situation in the city. The City of New York shows no such concern in increasing real estate taxes by unconscion able amounts. My own taxes for the current two years, will have increased by 35 per cent— far more than any mortgagee would increase my interest cost. Nor does the Commission er consider the obvious course of meeting housing decay—to permit rents to rise to levels paid outside the City of New York. Instead, in the face of three reports commissioned by the city to the contrary, he urges continuance of rent con trols at present levels. Step to Moratorium Commissioner Altman does a serious disservice to the hous ing situation by even question ing the right of mortgagees to seek current levels of interest for the protection of their de positors and policyholders. It is only a short step from rent control to interest moratorium. Mortgagees will flee the city as rapidly as possible and mort gages will be unobtainable at any rate. Mayor Lindsay succeeded in stopping new private housing construction by imposting Rent Stabilization. His Commission er is now hastening the debacle by driving mortgage money from the city. ARTHUR T.

Aborting Abortion Reform,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/03/archives/aborting-abortion-reform.html,"The right of women to end unwanted pregnancies and the physical, emotional and economic strains they can cause has been recognized in a new New York State law which takes effect July 1. If properly implemented, this law should make legalized abor tions available to the poor and near‐poor just as they have always been available to the well‐to‐do who could travel to jurisdictions already sanctioning them.  There is some question, however, about the imple mentation of the law in New York City. Officials here intend to restrict abortions to hospitals, a limita tion that has not been placed on other types operations even though an early abortion under proper medical supervision and sanitary conditions is now considered one of the safest operations— less dangerous, for example, than dental surgery, which is performed outside hospitals. To require that abortions be performed only in hospitals is to risk further crowding of these already overcrowded facilities, to the detriment of all patients. It is, perhaps, to deny some women abortions they otherwise could receive and, in effect, to abort the humane features of the new abortion law. A more sensible arrangement, followed elsewhere, is to permit abortions at specially licensed clinics with the doctors having access to hospitals should their facilities be deemed necessary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lindsay Says Budget Is Heading Into a Hard Fight,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/04/archives/lindsay-says-budget-is-heading-into-a-hard-fight-press-attack-cited.html,"Mayor Lindsay declared yes terday that his proposed $7.8‐ billion budget faced a “perilous problem” in the City Council and Board of Estimate, and that not a “single voice” had supported new revenue mea sures without which the record budget would be in “default.”  The Mayor confronted a con ference of the Society of Urban Physicians, maae up of medical leaders of the municipal hospi tals, meeting at the New York University Medical Center. On Tuesday the 350‐member organization urged members of the board of the city's incoming Health and Hospital Corpora tion to resign unless allocations were increased “to make possible a reasonable standard of care.” “I don't know of an area or a time when we have been stretched so thin,” Mr. Lindsay asserted. He said the budget proposed only three areas of real increases—health, higher education and sanitation. Its other increases, he said, were “just treading water” and were “almost all chewed, up in inflation” and employe costs while pressures from “highly organized and powerful muni cipal employe unions continue.” Press Attack Cited Even so, he said, his pro posals were “under attack each day by one newspaper for pro fligacy, urging the Board of Estimate and Council to cut down.” “I have not yet heard a single voice in support of those rev enue measures,” he added. His reference was to proposals needing city Council or Board of Estimate action for $180.6‐ million in taxes on commercial occupancy, auto use, parking lots and garages, transient hotels and liquor licenses and increases in water charges, li censes fees, miscellaneous serv ices and the Staten Island ferry fare. A psychiatrist, Dr. June Christmas, chief of the Harlem Rehabilitation Center of Har lem Hospital, said $350,000 was needed to avert the June 30 closing of the center. The Mayor promised to “take a good look at it, and I'll be pressing for it.” The center has provided aid on alcoholic, narcotic, disabil ity, social and psychiatric prob lems, and has trained Harlem residents under the New Ca reers program. ‘Scandalous,’ Mayor Says Mr. Lindsay said the “ex cellent” project was started by Federal aid, but had been dropped in the city's lap in what he held to be typical and “scandalous” fashion. The Health and Hospitals Corporation has been allocated $609.6‐million by the Mayor for the year starting July 1, when it is to take over operation of the municipal hospitals. But Dr. Seymour M. Glick —chief of medical services at Coney Island Hospital and co chairman of the society's three‐ day conference, which ended yesterday—said that figure al lotted only $48.8‐million to maintain existing services, com pared with a $60‐million need estimated by the Hospital De partment. Instead of the department's “inadequate” bid for $60‐mil lion more in start‐up funds for the new corporation and other purposes,. Dr. Glick said the Mayor provided $9‐million for administrative costs and $5‐ million for “patient‐care im provement, of which the great bulk will probably be con sumed by an active abortion program.” Manpower Shortages Dr. Glick asserted that the municipal hospitals had “criti cal deficiencies” and that man power shortages included 260 members of nursing services, from supervisors to clerks; 200 in dietary, 30 in pharmaceutical and 65 in technician services. Mayor Lindsay charged that a “senseless war in Indochina” was contributing to “a na tional crisis in health care.” He accused the Federal Govern ment of “abdication of respon sibility” in the shortages of health professionals. He asserted there are no new programs for medical schools and students and bio medical research, and that President Nixon's budget of fered only $7‐million for 1971 over the $562‐million allocated in 1969. Taking on one question after another critical of his policies, the Mayor told a story about a centipede whose 100 legs were all aching. A “wise mon key,” he said, told the centi pede to imitate the caterpillar by shedding the legs and be coming amoth. “How do I do it?” the cen tipede asked. “My job is to make policy, your job is to implement it,” the monkey re plied.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Michaels, Whose Vote Passed Abortion Bill, Will Stay in Race",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/05/archives/michaels-whose-vote-passed-abortion-bill-will-stay-in-race.html,"Assemblyman George M. Michaels, who cast the key vote to liberalize New York's abor tion law, and who has been hospitalizea for a week follow ing an automobile accident, an nounced yesterday that he would continue as a candidate for re‐election.  “The word is go,” said victor ??. Bahou, Cortland County Democratic chairman and a Michaels supporter. He and Mr. Michaels's physician added that he Assemblyman, who is in the ??ntensive care unit of Auburn Memorial Hospital, would ??robably be unable to resume active campaigning before the rune 23 primary. There had ??een fears that the injuries suf ??ered in the accident might have forced his withdrawal from the race. Mr. Michaels's medical ptog ress is satisfactory enough to permit a full resumption of activities within a few months, Bahon and the physician said. In the meantime, Mr. Michaels's wife and other mem bers of his family will make personal appearances on his behalf in the 122d Assembly District, in the Auburn area. Faces Rural Voters For a few hectic days in April, Mr. Michaels received national attention when, his voice quavering with emotion, he reversed his position and cast the deciding vote to radi cally liberalize the state's 19th century abortion law. Now, approximately two months later, Mr. Michaels, a Democrat, is facing the conse quences of that agonizing deci sion before a much smaller and more demanding audience—the approximately 56,000 voters of rural and predominantly Re publican Cayuga and Cortland Counties. At the time that Mr. Michaels cast his final “yes” vote on the abortion bill after having twice voted against it, he said tear fully. “I am terminating my political career.” There are those in this pleasant, clean, somewhat sleepy city of 35,000 who unhappily think he did just that and there are others who hope so. Shortly after his decision, which, he said, was made to “keep peace in my family,” Mr. Michaels, seeking his sixth term in the Assembly, was re fused the endorsement of the Cayuga Democratic County Committee. The committee backed John Rossi, a 3I‐year‐ old lawyer who represents the Auburn renewal agency and who is a justice of the peace. For the first time in his poli tical career. Mr. Michaels who received the backing of the less powerful Cortland County Democratic organization, sud denly found himself having to set up a campaign head quarters, recruit volunteers and tread the uphill path of the underdog. “I've always relied on the county committee,” the 59‐year‐ old lawyer said in an interview in his law office in Auburn be fore his auto accident. “I've never had a primary at any time. I've never had a cam paign headquarters.” The repercussions of his vote in the Assembly have created a tangled political situation for the district. For the first time in memory there are four candidates vying in the primary: Mr. Michaels, who has Liberal party backing, a party that is insignificant here, but that will provide him a line on the bal lot for the election if he loses his Democratic bid; Mr. Rossi; Lloyd Riford Jr., a 46‐year‐old farmer and businessman who has the backing of the Repub lican organization, and Dr. Max L. Fox, a 56‐year‐old physician who is hoping to beat Mr. Ri ford and who has the backing of the Conservative party, which guarantees him a line if he loses to Mr. Riford. Earlier Statements Cited Two of Mr. Michaels's op ponents—Mr. Rossi and Mr. Ri ford—are more critical of the way that Mr. Michaels arrived at his decision than the fact that he voted affirmatively on the most dramatic controversial and emotional issue that came before the 1970 Legislature. “It is a question of the man ner in which he arrived at this decision,” Mr. Rossi said. “Ini tially he made commitments to medical societies and clergy men, saying that as a matter of conscience he could not vote for the bill, and he voted against it twice.” “I'm not a hero on this thing,” Mr. Michaels said. “Al of a sudden I found myself caught up in somethini bigger than I am. I'm just a small country lawyer. There is no question that the people who were my most active sup porters in the Democratic party were appalled when I did what I did.” In the recent interview he said that in explaining his vote in the Assembly, “I was not articulate.” “What I meant to say was that my family knew how ?? felt and I voted negatively twice to please my constituents. II I had done what my conscience dictated from the start—if I'c voted for it right from the start I'd have been just one of the puck.” A large portion or mi chaels's opposition comes from the Roman Catholic population in his district. It is centered in Auburn. Mr. Michaels's political ca reer is something of an anom aly. He is a Democrat, but most of the voters in his district are Republicans. Also, he is a Jew in a two‐county area that Has no more than 125 Jewish fath ilies. Democratic strategists in the area contend that Mr. Michaels, who has managed to win re peatedly because he, has a “good” voting record on farm and labor issues and is rated an able campaigner, will be a “true spoiler” if he loses the Democratic primary and stays on the ballot and siphons votes from Mr. Rossi. Tries to Clarify Mr. Michaels sees it differ ently. “The thing that is start ing to come across to people is, ‘Was it quite right for the county committee to cast me aside when all I asked them was doesn't it have a responsi bility to all the voters to let them decide whether I did the right thing or not,’” he said. In his campaigning at bake sales, kaffee klatches, barbe cues and the like, Mr. Michaels has been trying to clarify what ho calls “misunderstandings” about the new abortion law. “There's going to come a time when the people in this community will recognize that this had to be done,” he said of his vote and passage of the law. According to William McKeon, the head of the Cayuga County Democratic or ganization: “A countywide pri mary is something new to us. To my knowledge we've never had one—and I've been chair man 18 years. The whole thing will be determined by who gets the vote out on primary day. It'll be a very close election.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Everything was wrong about Shirley, including her name",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/07/archives/everything-was-wrong-about-shirley-including-her-name-a-fairly-good.html,"Dividing the world up into Us and Them is a sin, a blunder and a thing we blundering sinners find ourselves doing all the time whether we mean to or not. Mavis Gallant has written a book about a woman who can't manage this feat. It is very funny and very frightening. Any reader (ex‐ cept Them, those callous louts) is going to be caught in a whirlpool of mirth and shame, wincing with help less laughter and horrified recogni tion, remembering gaffes and faux pas and hallucinated love affairs where each partner was going in a different direction and talking an other language. The resemblance of Miss Gallant's characters to most of humanity, living or dead, is far from coincidental. Twenty‐six‐year‐old Shirley Hig gins Perrigny, lost in Paris in the summer of 1963, is the epitome and patron saint of the disaster‐prone in much the same spirit as was Chaplin's Little Tramp. Like him, Shirley is intelligent, humorous, gallant and generous — and crosswise with the world. Her life doesn't match up with reality as most people seem to see it. Behavior that comes naturally to her invites stupefied misinterpreta tion from almost everyone else. Her ability to say the wrong thing will stop a conversation in its tracks; her jokes are catastrophic; and anyone who asks can have her money. Even her name is wrong; who in Paris can spell or pronounce Shirley? And yet it never occurs to her to use her perfectly acceptable middle name, Anne. Her attention is continually directed to the wrong person, wrong place, wrong situation. She takes things seriously that appear nonsense to others and ignores her conven tional obligations. Among these the most prominent is her marriage to Philippe, a rising French journalist much given to social interpretation. (The excerpts from his articles will delight survivors of reading bouts with the “serious” side of Paris‐Match.) As the book opens, this union has just suffered a fatal shock. Shirley, typically con cerned about something else, doesn't even know it, although she has feared for months that it might happen. Then why hasn't she done some thing about it? Well, that is what the book is investigating, why she didn't and how she doesn't illustrated by what she is doing instead. Shirley's life is a mess, and one sympathizes deeply with Philippe's confusion, dis tress and final retreat from her American friends (female) who take their shoes off in the living room, get drunk on whisky and involve her in arranging their abortions and attend ing their suicide attempts. To say nothing of Shirley's male friends, like James, “that Greek upstairs,” with his entourage of weird young girls. She is untidy and gauche, loves parties, collects lame ducks, stays out all night to look after them, and serves food that Philippe's mother and sister regard as reason in itself for divorce. (Of course it never oc curred to Shirley to insist on a church as well as a civil marriage.) So when Philippe goes home to his mother with a very bad liver, it is only what anyone could have predicted. Yes indeed. Even then, the groan ing reader knows perfectly well that Shirley can get him back. But instead there is James; there are Renata and Rose and Crystal Lily and, worst of all, the whole frightful family of Maurels with whom Shirley proceeds to involve herself when she should be placating Philippe's Maman and nursing him through hepatitis. How can she do it? But by this time she has caught us too, we can neither own nor disown her. It is through knowing Shirley that we come to see that all the people (we too) who take her for a victim are quite, quite wrong. That's not what she is at all. Instead of jump ing to conventional conclusions about this awkward creature, why do so many people want things from Shirley? Answer: because she has so much to give, kindness, understand ing, insight, sympathy, warmth and —astounding, but we have to face it —the best kind of good advice to everyone else. But there she is, stepping all over her own feet. Because she is, we see that Miss Gallant is raising a more impor tant question by means of her unlikely, unforgettable heroine: What's wrong with a world that makes someone as valuable as Shirley behave as foolishly as Shirley? We are given some pointers out of the past to explain how she got where she is but no real answer, since that question is for pondering, not answering, at peril of dividing the world into two in another way, which only makes for further compli cations. Thus, it is much too simple to see Shirley as a rebuttal of the selfish coldness of the world‐as‐it‐is, as folly telling the truth and showing up the wise. If she does this it is not because she knows the truth, but because she herself is a question, not an answer, a question that insists we look for the truth because we do not know it. No two‐sided answers are any use to her at all, be cause no one will fit on one side only. As always, Miss Gallant's prose is a serious delight. She has Dickens's gift for charac ters, astonishing, unchallenge able, and there is just a sen tence or two. She has Dickens's ability, also, to carry sensibility over the line of the ridiculous and yet keep it human. Of course she doesn't have his scope, but neither does she have his sentimentality. If she is limited, it is because she limits herself and wrings her wit dry of grotesquerie and ex aggeration. If she chooses to set herself up with a heroine who might be one of Mr. Micawber's great‐grandchildren, she is determined to chronicle Shirley's destiny in terms of plain fact. Here are some facts about a world where the ca pacity for sympathy is a burden to its possessor, a deformity to others and, at the same time, represents the compassion we so desperately long for.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Eased Laws on Abortion Failing to Achieve Goals,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/08/archives/eased-laws-on-abortion-failing-to-achieve-goals-eased-laws-on.html,"The reform of abortion laws has thus far made barely a dent in the criminal abortion rate and has failed to produce anything resembling a revolu tion in medical practice or atti tude in any of the five states that have had two or more years of experience with eased restrictions on legal abortions.  An examination of how the laws in those states—Colorado, California, Maryland, Georgia and North Carolina—are work ing revealed a wide range of problems. Among them were an overloading of some facilities and physicians' schedules and a relative unavailability of le gal abortions to the poor and uneducated. In addition, built in procedural delays have made those abortions that are granted far more complicated, expensive and dangerous oper ations than they need be. Doctors interviewed attribut ed the problems to a combina tion of legal cumbersomeness and medical conservatism. Twelve states have now passed abortion reform laws. The statutes extend the reasons for which abortion may be per formed to include, in most states, probable harm of the continuing pregnancy to the physical or mental health of the mother; possible birth of a defective child, and pregnancy resulting from rape or incest. The laws require that medical or legal consultants attest to the need for the abortion. Although it is still too early to assess the experience Hawaii has had with the nation's most far‐reaching abortion law, a somewhat unequal sharing of the abortion burden is already apparent. In the first two and a half months under the new Hawaii law, four hospitals have done abortions—one doing 398 of the total of 589. In addition to Roman Catholic physicians, who have refused to do abor tions for religious reasons, number of doctors who are not Catholic have refused without offering any reason. The Hawaii law, in a category called “repealed” abortion laws, removes all restrictions on abortions performed in hos pitals by physicians on state residents. It requires no con sultation. A law similar to it will take effect in Alaska on July 29. The nation's most liberal abortion law (it contains no legislated residency require ment) will take effect in New York State on July 1. But judg ing from experience in other states, some physicians predict that New York will face the same foot‐dragging, medical conservatism and institutional reluctance to get involved with “the messy business of abor tion,” as one New York hos pital administrator has put it, that have hampered implemen tation of liberalized laws else where in the country. Observers in some states have noted a gradual easing of medical reluctance to handle portions. But the day when abortions will be regarded with the same equanimity as ap pendectomies by the majority of doctors seems a long way off. Specter of Abortion As one doctor remarked: “The specter of abortion as an illegal, dirty, immoral pro cedure and the notion that ‘those who play must pay’ die hard.” Many of the original agitators for abortion reform are now looking to outright repeal legis lation as the answer to their dissatisfaction. The board of trustees of the American Medi cal Association will propose an abortion‐repeal policy to the association's House of Dele gates later this month. However, Dr. Abraham Heller, a Denver psychiatrist who has been a leader in im plementing Colorado's liberal ized law, believes that “those who see repeal as a cure‐all are naive.” “Regardless of the law,” he maintains, “there is a tremend ous inner resistance of the medical profession to overcome. It is difficult for many physic ians, conditioned by a life time commitment to the preser vation of life, to change their lights and practice so sud denly.” In the five states with re formed laws for which infor mation is available, only a handful of hospitals and a small percentage of qualified physicians have participated, In some states, liberalization of the abortion laws has thus far spurred no change in practice whatsoever. In Georgia, for example, the hospital abortion rate in the first year under the new law was well below the national average—1.3 hospital abortions per 1,000 live births, compared with 2 abortions per 1,000 births for the country as a whole. Siutation in Colorado In Colorado, Dr. Heller says, “five of the state's 50 accred ited hospitals have done 81 per cent of the medical abortions, and four of these five are in the city of Denver. Of the re maining hospitals, 25 have done no abortions at all.” During Maryland's first year of experience with a reformed abortion law, fewer than 20 per cent of the state's obstetri cians performed any abortions at all, and more than a half of the legal abortions done in Baltimore were performed by doctors at one hospital—Johns Hopkins. And in California, 63 per cent of the abortions were done in hospitals in the San. Francisco area, which accounts for 23 per cent of the state's births Only 19 per cent of the abortions were done in the Los Angeles area with 44 per cent of the births. In some states, reform of abortion laws has, for the first time, given the poor and mi nority groups access to legal abortions. But, for reasons other than financial, the pro portion of disadvantaged groups who obtain hospital abortions is still far below their repre sentation in the population. “In general,” Dr. Heller of Denver explains, “the poor are slow to become aware of and to take advantage of new med ical developments. In addition, the law operates through com plicated and cumbersome mech anisms—testimony by consult ants and approval by commit tees—that, on a de facto basis, continue the traditional dis crimination against the poor and disadvantaged groups.” Effect on Criminal Rate In San Diego, where Medi Cal finances hospital abortions for the indigent, the ratio of abortions to deliveries among whites k five times that among blacks. And in Georgia, where only 113 hospital abortions were done during the first year under a reformed law, more than one‐third of the popula tion is black but only 10 per cent of the abortion patients were black. The effect of revised abortion laws on the criminal abortion rate—now at an estimated 1.2 million a year—has been almost imperceptible. Hospitals in states with reformed laws have not noted any significant de cline in admissions for com plications following illegally in ??uced abortions. In California in 1968, an esti Mated total of 81,600 abortions were done, more than 76,000 of which were illegal, according to Dr. Paul Brenner, medical di rector of the Planned Parent hood Association of San Diego County. Dr. Allan C. Barnes, chief of obstetrics at Johns Hopkins Hospital, sees repeal of Mary land's reformed abortion law (a bill to do just that was vetoed last month by Gov. Marvin Mandel) as a means of making abortions more accessible. Dr. Barnes remarked that, with repeal, “those who have been hiding behind strict in terpretation of the specified indications for abortions and the mechanism necessary to attest to those indications will have their hiding place taken away.” Maryland's law requires a “hospital review authority,” which has been variously in terpreted as a committee of one to three doctors, to approve all abortion cases. Colorado law requires the ap proval of a hospital board of three physicians. California re quires a two‐or‐three‐member abortion board. North Carolina requires consultation with three physicians, who must not be associated together in practice. Georgia requires two consult ants in addition to the operat ing physician plus the approval of a hospital committee of three or more doctors. The legal barriers to abortion encountered in states with re formed laws are typified by a recent case in North Carofina. A 12‐year‐old girl who was raped was refused an abortion because she had failed to report the incident to the police within the seven days required by North Carolina's law. A more widespread and there fore more serious problem en countered under reformed abor tion laws is the inherent delay involved in obtaining the re quired consultation. Since well over 90 per cent of legal abor tions done under these laws are performed for “mental health” reasons, this consultation is usually with one or more psy chiatrists. Outpatient Abortions At Johns Hopkins in Balti more, clinic patients seeking abortions usually have to wait three to five weeks for an ap pointment with a psychiatrist. As a result, says Dr. Irvin Cush ner, professor of obstetrics at the hospital, the overwhelming majority of patients are beyond the 12th week of pregnancy. The later in pregnancy an abortion is done, the more dif ficult and costly the procedure is and the more likely it is to result in complications. Termi nation of a pregnancy beyond 12 weeks also precludes the possibility of doing the pro cedure on an outpatient basis, an approach several hospitals have recently adopted to save time and money and to accom modate more patients. As an outpatient, a woman comes in to the hospital in the morning, is aborted and then goes home in the afternoon, after several hours of observa tion. Spokesmen say that Johns Hopkins has done 200 outpa tient abortions since January without any serious complica tions. Only one patient had to be admitted to the hospital from the recovery room and none had to be readmitted once discharged. Outpatient abortions are vir tually a necessity in states where repeal of the law will make abortions theoretically available to all who want them. New York City alone antici pates 50,000 to 100,000 abor tion requests a year just among city residents. To do anywhere near this number the traditional way—with a two‐or‐three‐day hospital stay—is simply not feasible, either in terms of cost or available bed space. As more states move toward the blanket‐repeal approach, many doctors envision the es tablishment of fully equipped specialty clinics where several dozen abortions could be done each day on a come‐and‐go basis during early pregnancy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Scientific and Welfare Groups Open a 4‐Day Study of Population Growth,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/09/archives/scientific-and-welfare-groups-open-a-4day-study-of-population.html,"CHICAGO, June 8 — As a “humanometer” on the mezza nine of the Pick‐Congress Hotel clicked off the world's current population increase at the rate of more than two a second, representatives of hundreds of academic, scientific and wel fare organizations met today for the most intensive scrutiny to date of the problem of the global “population bomb.”  Every minute, according to the Population Reference Bureau in Washington, 235 babies are born in the world and 96 persons die, for a net population increase of 139 a minute and 72.6 million a year —a rate that threatens to dou ble the earth's 3.5 billion in habitants in about 30 years. Uninterruped continuation of this rate obviously could over tax standing room on the globe, and somewhere short of that, many experts say, would direly aggravate famine and disease and precipitate unpredictable disorders. 4‐Day Meeting Where and how to initiate a systematic slowdown was the focus of a First National Con gress on Optimum Population and Environment that began a four‐day meeting here. The congress was convoked by leaders of scores of organi zations that ranged from re ligious groups to labor unions. The sponsoring organization, the Congress on Population and Environment, Inc. is head ed by Willard W. Wirtz, Sec retary of Labor in the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations. The conference's $400,000 budget was contributed by a number of foundations, en vironmental, social and indus trial organizations, and indi vidual donors. More than 100, 000 delegates are expected to participate. Some Roman Cath olic organizations as well as Protestant churches and Jew ish groups were represented. Government Bans Discounted Contrary to widespread con jectural discussion in the last few years, the need at this juncture for compulsory gov ernmental measures to limit procreation was generally dis counted by speakers at the opening sessions. Dr. George Wald, Harvard University's Nobel laureate in medicine and physiology, said that more general application of contraception and abortion, and tax pressures against large families, should be tried before more stringent measures. Senator Joseph D. Tydings, Democrat of Maryland, outlined a political approach: a large scale, federally sponsored cam paign “to educate the Ameri can public on the dimensions and consequences of U. S. and global population growth.” ‘Voluntarism’ Urged Dr. Philip M. Hauser, a Uni versity of Chicago sociologist, said a decrease in the birth and population growth rate in the United States “can undoubtedly be achieved by voluntarism of the type which has already characterized the reproductive habits of the American people.” Even Dr. Paul Ehrlich, a biol ogy professor at Stanford Uni versity who has been the lead ing voice in deploring the “population bomb,” observed in remarks prepared for the con ference: “Probably the United States birth rate can be reduced to a replacement level with a changed social climate, com plete access to all forms of birth control, including abor tion for everyone, and a few mild governmental measures to discourage reproduction.” Discussions at the conference emphasized that viable popula tion policies were closely tied to the gamut of other environ mental problems, from land use to the abatement of various pollutions. Pollution Control Stressed Speakers also emphasized that, while pollution generally was a result of population, it was not an inevitable “con comitant.” “It's much cheaper to elimi nate pollution at the source than clean it up after it's hap pened,” Dr. Ehrlich said at a news conference. Also stressed was the point that neither excess population nor other environmental prob lems could properly be sepa rated from poverty and civil rights. “We are told from some quarters,” Dr. Wald said, “that population limitation is just an attempt at genocide—an at tempt by the well‐to‐do to limit the numbers of the poor, an at tempt by the well‐to‐do nations to limit the underdeveloped countries. “One has to couple the at tempt to limit population with a genuine and effective attempt to take care of all the people that are in existence. Anything else would be conscienceless.” Somewhere, he said, human ity has “just taken the wrong turn,” and, like the dinosaur, has disrupted mammals' tradi tional high “proportion of brains to brawn.” And like the dinosaur, which “laid eggs and left them,” he continued, “we are no longer taking good care of our young.” Congressional Resistance Dr. Wald said that the cam paign against pollution faced two potential traps: “the temp tation to make pollution an is sue to distract people from all the other things that need do ing, and the temptation to turn pollution into a new dinosaur —to let pollution go on, but superimpose on it a multi‐bil lion dollar business of anti pollution.” Senator Tydings maintained that “strong resistance still ex ists in Congress to programs promoting voluntary family planning, much less compul sory population control.” He added: “Indeed, at this time, talk of compulsion constitutes the greatest threat to the suc cess of the voluntary popula tion stabilization movement. We simply do not know what kinds of voluntary incentives, economic rewards and educa tional programs might reduce the birth rate to a level con sistent with securing a stable population.” Senator Tydings said he planned to introduce in the Senate this week a resolution “to place Congress officially on record in support of a na tional population stabilization policy” and legislation “to pro vide Federal funds for a com prehensive population educa tion program.” A Presidential commission has already been established to study popula tion programs and policies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Physicians Urged to Defy City and State Guidelines on Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/11/archives/physicians-urged-to-defy-city-and-state-guidelines-on-abortions.html,"A program to encourage phy sicians to perform abortions in their own offices or in clinics —in defiance of city and state guidelines—is being set in mo tion by the National Associa tion for Repeal of Abortion Laws.  New York's liberalized abor tion law—the most permissive in the country—will take ef fect July 1. It removes all re strictions on abortions up to the 26th week of pregnancy, and after that an abortion can be performed only to save the woman's life. However, separate sets of guidelines, which have no legal standing, have been set forth by the State Health Depart ment, the State Medical Society and the city's Health Services Administration. All three proposed about the same standards. All say abor tions should be performed only in a hospital (the state guide lines will also permit them in a hospital‐affiliated clinic). Lawrence Lader, an author and chiarman of the national repeal association, declared yesterday that the guidelines “are in direct conflict with the law, which imposes no such restrictions.” Symposium Scheduled “The need for out‐of‐hospital abortions is going to be very critical, because there's just no evidence that the hospitals are going to be ready,” he said. The association has scheduled an all‐day symposium on out of‐hospital abortion techniques for July 1 at the New York University Medical Center. The first 350 physicians to accept invitations will be admitted, and further sessions will be scheduled if there is sufficient demand, Mr. Ladef said. Dr. Bernard Nathanson of St. Luke's Hospital, medical ad viser to the association, will describe the saline evacuation procedure; Dr. Richard Hausk necht of Mt. Sinai Hospital will discuss the dilation and curet tage technique, and a film will be shown on the vacuum as piration procedure. Other speakers will discuss the legal and political impli cations of abortion. The program will be to no avail, however, if the city's Board of Health decides to amend the city's Health Code to require that abortions be performed in a hospital. The board is planning two meetings this month to consider this move. Amendment of the Health Code—which has the force of law—also requires a public hearing. Criticism of the city guide lines also came this week from another source, State Assem blyman Franz S. Leichter. In a letter to Dr. Mary C. Mc Laughlin, the City Health Com missioner, Mr. Leichter, a Manhattan Democrat, said: “The Legislature specifically rejected a requirement that abortions be restricted to hos pitals and I think it is unwise and unfortunate for the city to impose such a requirement for municipal hospitals one moreover impose such a re quirement on other hospitals through incorporation of your ruling into the Health Code.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
REPUTED MAFIOSI SEIZED IN RAIDS,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/12/archives/reputed-mafiosi-seized-in-raids-among-35-arrested-after-contempt-in.html,"Thirty‐five reputed under world figures were arrested yesterday in eight counties in and around New York City as District Attorney Eugene Gold of Kings County announced their indictment on charges of criminal contempt.  Eleven other men whose in dictments were also announced were still being sought on the same charges. The charges resulted from the defendants' alleged refusal to answer questions put to them after they were granted im munity from prosecution by a Kings County grand jury in vestigating the infiltration of legitimate businesses by organ ized crime and a series of shootings. Among those seized in raids carried out as early as 6 A.M. by nearly 100 men from Mr. Gold's office and the Police Department were reputed mem bers of the Mafia “families” of Carlo Gambino and Joseph Colombo and one formerly headed by Joseph Bonanno. Mr. Gold said the arrests indicated that “we are going to pursue the lawless conduct of organized crime re lentlessly.” No one, he said, “has the right to flout the au thority of a grand jury.” Mr. Gold said he believed the arrests were the most at any one time involving organized crime since 1957, when 62 underworld figures were taken in to custody by the state police in Apalachin, N. Y. Throughout yesterday after noon the 35 arrested men— some dressed casually, others neatly and conservatively—ap peared for arraignment before State Supreme Court Justice Milton Mollen. He paroled seven and set bail of $500 to $10,000 for the others. All pleaded not guilty. Conviction for criminal con tempt carries a maximun pen alty of one year in prison and a fine of $1,000. Mr. Gold said the 46 indicted men had a previous record of 317 arrests for such crimes as gambling, abortion, extortion, kidnapping, rape, narcotics traf ficking and homicide. Some Believed Dead He also said some of the men sought under the indictments were believed to be dead and may never be found. Others are expected to surrender or to be arrested soon. Mr. Gold said that no resist ance was encounterd in carry ing out the arrests. Among those seized was Natale (Joe Diamond) Evola, 63 years old, described as a suc cessor to Bonanno; Paul Sciacca, a reputed adviser of the family; Bruno Capio, de scribed as a captain in the fam ily, and Philip (Rusty) Rastelli, 51, who was also called a high ranking member of the family. Frank Mari is believed to have been murdered. He was a close associate of Sciacca. Anniello Dellacroce, 55, has been described as an under boss in the Gambino family and four other names in the indict ments were described as cap tains in that family. Nicholas Bianco has been de scribed as third in command of the Colombo family. Colombo, who has been described as in strumental in the current picketing of Federal Bureau of Investigation headquarters in Manhattan, is facing charges of perjury and tax evasion. Gambino, 67, reputed “boss of the bosses” of the six Maria families in the New York‐New Jersey area, is facing a charge of conspiracy to hijack an armored car. Mr. Gold said that each of the 46 men named yesterday had been indicted individually and that some had been charged with more than one count of contempt. The grand jury before which they appeared was impaneled in May, 1968. A different grand jury handed up the indictments. Mr. Gold said no attempt had been made to inform Federal officials or authorities in other jurisdictions that the arrests were to be made yesterday. “There was no reason to,” he said, noting that the indict ments had been handed up by a Brooklyn grand jury. As for other jurisdictions, he said “they're not involved in any way.” The F.B.I. was understood to have known that Mr. Gold was planning to move, but was not given names and did not par ticipate in the arrests. A Federal View William M. Tendy, a Federal prosecutor, said: “Top‐echelon mobsters are not pushed into revealing information because of the possibility of being pu nished by contempt. I've had dozens of these cases before grand juries and none of them has worked out yet.” Following is a list, prepared by Mr. Gold's office, of those named in the indictments: ??",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wider Detection of Prenatal Flaws Expected to Spur Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/13/archives/wider-detection-of-prenatal-flaws-expected-to-spur-abortions.html,"Prenatal identification of birth defects has reached the stage where an increasing num ber of mothers are expected to take advantage of liberalized abortion laws to avoid the birth of children with severe disabilities.  In the long run, mass screen ing and weeding out of de fective fetuses may become possible, but troublesome ethi cal questions have already arisen. Where birth defects are sus pected, or identified, in a fetus, what are the rights and obliga tions of the mother, the father, the physician, and the society that may have to render life long support to the infant? What are the rights of the unborn child? For example it Is already possible to identify before birth (and abort) any fetus that will be mongoloid. Since half of all mongoloid children are born to mothers of 35 or older, by screening all such mothers in early pregnancy it should be possible to halve the birth rate of such infants. It has been estimated by public health specialists that by 1975, if present birth rates continue, the yearly cost of maintaining mongoloids in the United States will have reached $1.75‐billion. Parley on Problems Last weekend a conference of specialists in law, genetic screening, obstetrics, abortion, public health and related sub jects was held at Columbia Uni versity Law School to explore these problems. The subject was “The legal, social, and bio logical significance of prenatal genetic diagnosis.” The meeting was organized by the Council for Biology in Human Affairs of the Salk In stitute in La Jolla, Calif. The participants, many of them dis tinguished university profes sors, spoke freely on these delicate subjects since their re marks were “off the record.” The extent of scientific con cern in this area was also re flected in the testimony of Dr. Joshua Lederberg, winner of a Nobel Prize for his genetics re search. Appearing before a House appropriations subcom mittee on Wednesday, he urged formation of a national task force to identify and coordinate research in critical areas of genetics, particularly as they apply to genetic disease. Prenatal screening depends on a procedure known as amni ocentesis. A needle is inserted through the abdomen of the mother and a small amount of amniotic fluid Is withdrawn from the sac in which the fetus is floating. This fluid has special ana lytical value because it is nor mally swallowed by the fetus which also discharges urine into it. The fluid thus contain cells washed from the interim of the fetus, plus cells from its exterior and from the sac. Amniotic Fluid Test All of these cells are gene tically part of the baby. About one cell in a thousand is still alive in the withdrawn fluid and can be cultured in the laboratory. During cell division the genetic material forms into chromosomes that can be pho tographed and sorted to see if the fetus has the proper quota of 23 chromosome pairs, or 46 in all. If it has 47, with three, in stead of two, “No. 21” chro mosomes, it will be mongoloid. If it has an abnormal quota of the sex‐determining chromo somes, it may either be mental ly retarded, prone to violence, stunted, very tall—or normal and even of above‐average intelligence. By allowing the cultured cells to multiply until they number in the millions (they double roughly once every 24 hours), it is possible to test their chem istry for inherited disorders such as those where a particu lar enzyme is missing and the body chemistry goes awry. However, while there are some 1,200 genetic diseases— as noted by Dr. Lederberg, a number far larger than most physicians realize—only eight of those involving biochemical defects have been identified so far by prenatal screening. According to participants in last weekend's conference an other 20 or 30 such defects seem within reach, including the enzyme deficiency known as phenylketonuria, or PKU, but the great majority will be difficult to identify in this way. The reason is that cells found in the amniotic fluid tend to be of the type that evolve into connective tissue, rather than into more specialized organs the chemical functions within such connective cells, by and large, are not those that figure in inherited disorders. Challenge to Researcher However, like other body cells, those found in the amni otic fluid carry instructions for all body chemistry, even though most of the instructions are latent. Some optimists hope the ells can somehow be coaxed into performing enough of this latent chemistry to show whether or not the person‐to be is destined for trouble. Another approach is to iden tify latent genetic defects in the parents. If both parents, although healthy, carry the same latent defect, there is a one‐in‐four chance that it will appear as a disease in their offspring. Such latent, or “recessive,” genes can now be identified in some cases by a series of chem ical tricks. Each individual car ries two genes or bits of genet ic instruction, for every human characteristic: one from each parent. A recessive gene is thought often to be an inoperative part of the genetic code. If it is mated with a normal, or domi nant, gene, the latter does the necessary job (such as making a certain enzyme) although usually at only half the rate, had there been two active genes of this type. However if both genes for the process are recessive, the function is not performed, and the person may be seriously affected. Radioactive ‘Tagging’ Ways have now been found —for example at the Univer sity of Colorado—to look into the chemistry of a person's cells and see if a particular recessive gene is there. This is done in a sample of his body cells by tagging a starting substance with radio active atoms and seeing if each step of the chemistry runs at full speed. If one step runs at half‐speed, a hidden recessive is suspected. This has already been done, for example, in the case of galactosemia, an inherited dis order in which the body lacks an enzyme needed to process sugars. Death or mental de ficiency can result. If both par ents carry the recessive gene for this disease, they can be warned of the danger to their offspring. A major difficulty In per forming abortions, once a de fect has been identified, is the length of time required for the identification. While attempts to remove amniotic fluid have been reported in pregnancies only eight weeks old, the risk of injury to the tiny fetus at such an. early stage is consid ered too great. Time Running Out By 14 weeks, with the fetus in a cupful of fluid, a skilled specialist can do the job, being careful to locate and avoid both fetus and placenta. By 18 weeks, according to specialists, “any experienced obstetrician” should ultimately be able to carry out the procedure. However it then takes a week or more to culture the cells and identify their chromosomes. Furthermore in 10 per cent of the cases the procedure may have to be repeated. By then it is close to the 20th week, beyond which time many phy sicians are reluctant to abort. The fetus may have begun to move at the 15th week and so the mother, too, may shrink from the procedure. During the first 13 weeks an abortion is relatively simple, particularly using the suction method devised by the Chinese in the 1950's. Until recently, the standard method was to dilate the cervix and scrape the uterus, being careful to re move the tiny placenta, lest prolonged bleeding ensue. Many physicians now consid er the suction method simpler, and kinder to the uterus. A small device inserted by way of the cervix sucks out all that needs to be removed without, need for scraping. A fetus more than 13 weeks old must be removed surgically or “salted out.” In the latter procedure some amniotic fluid is withdrawn and replaced with highly saline water. This causes death of the fetus and usually induces labor. An experimental method, us ing a slow drip of prostaglan din, into the bloodstream, is said to have induced labor in about 90 per cent of women less than 20 weeks pregnant. Prostaglandin is a product of both male and female reproduc tive systems. The process has to be closely watched, as it may, induce vomiting and other side effects. However, some physicians see it as an early step towards what might become a “do‐it yourself” method for early abortion. The cost of prenatal genetic screening now exceeds $100, largely because of the labori ous process of chromosome iso lation. Furthermore, it has only been carried out in early preg nancy on a few hundred women and so recently (largely within the last 18 months) that latent ill‐effects have not had much chance to appear. Nevertheless the results re ported so far have spurred op timism. At least partial auto mation of the analysis and economies from large‐scale op eration should bring down the cost, leading to forecasts that, at least with women over 35, such tests will become routine. Should they be made manda tory, like vaccinations? What if a fetus is found to have defect of the sex chromosomes that does not necessarily lead to an abnormal life? Who de cides on abortion, the mother alone or she and the father? Could an older mother who bears a mongoloid child sue her obstetrician for the cost of supporting such a child, if he did not perform a prenatal test? And to what extent should the Government take advantage of the new capabilities for pre venting the birth of individuals destined to a life of misery and dependence? The conferees last weekend examined these questions, but they were far from agreed on the answers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Science,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/14/archives/science-if-we-master-the-gene-.html,"Sitting in a secluded part of the campus, the young couple had been holding hands for some time, talking quietly. Suddenly one of them said: “Let's match cards!”  Each pulled out a business machine card printed with rows of numbers but punched with only a few holes. They carefully placed one card on the other. None of the holes matched. With little cries of relief they embraced, for the holes on each card represented dangerous recessive genes carried by the boy and the girl. Healthy human beings are each thought to carry one or two such genes of the thousand or more that can cause birth defects. Since the couple did not share any of these “recessive” genes, they could bear children with minimum fear that their offspring would be impaired. This is a story of tomor row, not of today. Methods for determining what hidden genes a person carries are in their infancy. Yet such techniques, plus improved methods for screening the genetic makeup of unborn babies and simplifed methods of early abortion, are already making it possible to curtail substantially the number of children born with such im pediments as mongolism. Last week Dr. Joshua Lederberg, professor of ge netics at Stanford University and a Nobel Laureate, told a subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropria tions that 15 out of 100 babies born alive later manifest some form of inherited dis order. These range from invari ably fatal diseases to those that result in lifelong mental retardation or some subtle deficiency in body chemistry. Beyond that it is evident that high susceptibility to some ailments, such as cancer and heart disease, is an inherited trait. The fact that efforts to control genetic defects have reached a critical stage was manifest, not only in Dr. Lederberg's testimony, but in a conference held last week end at the Columbia Univer sity Law School. Mongoloid Tests The meeting was told that by 1975 the cost to the na tion of caring for mongoloids alone would probably reach $1,750,000,000 a year. Yet by prenatal screening (if it were socially and economically feasible) all mongoloid fetuses could be identified and aborted before birth. Dr. Lederberg was testify ing on behalf of the National Cystic Fibrosis Research Foundation. Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disorder that can be fatal. It appears in children both of whose parents carried the gene for that defect. A person who has inherited such a defective gene from one of his parents will not manifest it (by having the disease) if he inherited the same gene in normal form from his other parent. Hence it is “recessive.” Such genes are in the coded instructions in the DNA (or deoxyribonucleic acid) that passes from parent to child. Often the recessive gene is one that fails to tell the body how to make some essential substance. Everyone carries two genes for every body function—one derived from each parent. If the child receives one normal gene in this process it will be healthy. But if that child marries someone who also carries the gene in recessive form their chances of bear ing a defeotive child are one in four. Dr. Lederberg's plea was for the creation of a “National Genetics Task Force” to coordinate re search in this area, spot developments amenable to immediate application and set priorities for Federal support. Last weekend's meeting at Columbia was organized by the Council for Biology in Human Affairs of the Salk Institute in La Jolla, Calif. It brought together some 30 specialists in genetics, pre natal genetic diagnosis, abor tion techniques and the law. In two days of off‐the record discussion they ex plored the ethical and medi cal Implications of the rapid progress being made in such techniques as amniocentesis. This is the procedure in which a small amount of amniotic fluid is withdrawn from the womb of a pregnant woman and analyzed to de termine the genetic makeup of the person‐to‐be. Cells adrift in the Quid are cultured in the laboratory and the chromosomes, or clumps of genetic material, that form during cell division are examined. In this way the telltale signs of mongolism can readily be identified, as well as the sex of the fetus. Unfortunately the present state of the art does not per mit Identification at this stage of most defects in body chemistry, of which more than 1,000 appear in the population. One of Dr. Lederberg's concerns, shared by a num ber of others in this field, is the role of environmental “insults” in causing defects. For example, Drs. Arthur Robinson and Theodore T. Puck and their colleagues at the University of Colorado Medical Center in Denver have found that the birth of babies with sex chromosome defects reaches a peak be tween July and October. There is also a suggestion of a similar seasonal variation in mongoloid births. The two researchers have proposed that viral infections may play a role in producing abnormal quotas of sex chromosomes after observing that the incidence of such defects rose sharply fol lowing a German measles epi demic. German Measles, or rubella, is also responsible for bodly defects such as impaired heart function, hear ing and sight. The seasonal variations are, of course, only vague clues to the specific causes of dam age to the genetic material. It is well known that the chances of conceiving a mon goloid child increase rapidly after the mother passes the age of 35. Half of all such babies are born to women in that higher age group. Each ovum produced by a woman of 40 was “born” through cell division, 40 years earlier and has thus been exposed to passible genetic damage for a rela tively long time. But what actually causes the damage is unknown. As noted by Dr. Lederberg in his testimony, the human environment is becoming more complex, what with food additives, drugs and en vironmental pollutants. Some substances that can cause infant malformations have al ready been identified, but others are probably more subtle and will be hard to discover. The conferees last week end seemed convinced that, when manipulation of genetic material becomes possible, it will be done primarily in those potentially handicapped by defects, rather than in the coded information they pass on to future generations. If, for example, a virus can alter the genes in adverse ways, as seems the case, it should be possible to produce viruses that can repair genes. There is, however, an in clination to leave the germ plasm—the genes to be passed on to future generations— alone. This is the part of us, as George Wald of Harvard puts it, that is immortal. A recessive gene that today seems undesirable may be able to defend the body against some as yet unseen disease. With genetic screen ing it should be possible to preserve such genes, yet pre vent most, if not all, of them from becoming manifest. The couple with matching punch cards could still marry, but they would be motivated to adopt children instead of bearing their own.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
From in back of his garden came the rumble of approaching death,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/14/archives/from-in-back-of-his-garden-came-the-rumble-of-approaching-death.html,"The Sound of The Mountain By Yasunari Kawabata. Translated by Edward Seidensticker. 276 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $6.95. Sex and its heady concomitants have always been a more popular subject for novelists than age and death; and despite the recent surfeit Eros seems unlikely to be displaced. Yet old age and the last solitary exit are central to the human pattern and a most challenging theme for writers of fiction. Two of Japan's best modern authors have used it with impressive effect in their novels. Junichiro Tanizaki's “Diary of a Mad Old Man” is a terrifying yet witty study of obsessive senile masochism. A subtler, gentler, yet in a way far sadder evocation of old age is “The Sound of the Mountain,” a rich, com plicated novel written by the 1968 Nobel Prize winner Yasunari Kawa bata in 1954 and now translated by Edward Seidensticker. Not that Shingo, through whose mind everything in the novel moves, is all that old: in fact he is only 64 and, though his memory oc casionally fails him, he is in enviable health and travels to work in Tokyo every day on a crowded com muter train from the seaside town of Kamakura where he lives with his rather disagreeable family. But like many Japanese people in their 60's Shingo has deliberately chosen to be old and, in his own special way, to enjoy it. The traditional Western approach to old age and extinction is resent ment (“What shall I do with this absurdity ... decrepit age that has been tied to me as to a dog's tail?”) and defiance (“Rage, rage against the dying of the light”). Old Shingo, how ever, is typically Japanese in the detached interest — almost amuse ment — with which he accepts the progressive death of his cells: “‘Of course. At my age you get more [gray hairs] every day. Every day— sometimes you see them turn gray right in front of your eyes.’ ‘Ridic ulous.’ ‘No. Just watch.’ Shingo leaned forward.” Before removing us from the scene for good, nature mocks us in strange ways: “It was an October morning. Shingo, tying his necktie, felt his hands go wrong. “‘Wait a minute.’ He paused, and a troubled expression came over his face. ‘How does it go?’ “He untied it and tried again, but was no more successful the second time. “Pulling the two ends up to his face, he gazed at them inquiringly ... “Slowly and awkwardly, he wound an end around a finger and tried to pull it through the loop, but the result was a strange lump... “Why should he suddenly this morning have forgotten a process he had repeated every morning through the forty years of his office career?” Strange indeed! Later in the train he finds that he is able to tie the recalcitrant knot without the slightest effort. There could hardly be a greater contrast between this episode and that extraordinary scene in Muriel Spark's “Memento Mori” when old Charmian doggedly defies her decrepitude by brewing a cup of tea. Her feat (for which she gets not the slightest credit since it was “impossible”) is a little triumph of the human spirit; but Shingo, the scion of a very different tradition, has no desire to pit himself against nature. In the winter of his life he turns a cold eye on death's daily victories: “Mizuta is dead, and Toriyama... Toriyama is dead too.” “The principal actors in the film, Koshiro and Uzaemon and Kikugora, were all dead.” “On Shingo's desk was a black‐bordered postcard. The cancer patient [his school friend] had died somewhat more swiftly than the natural course of the illness would have led one to expect.” To regret these deaths or to fear his own would be foolish self‐indulgence. It is not only the cells that die with age; the emotions too become atrophied. Shingo's daughter returns to Kamakura with her children, and shortly afterwards her husband com mits suicide. Shingo's son callously neglects his beautiful wife in Kama kura and has an affair with a girl in Tokyo. He makes both women miserable; he also makes them both pregnant, but it is the wife, not the mistress, who has an abortion. With weary detachment old Shingo observes their antics; now and then he goes through the motions of assuming responsibility as head of the family, but he is essentially un moved and aloof. To his old wife, his lifelong companion, Shingo's atti tude is one of bored, tolerant amuse ment, tinged with occasional regrets that he did not marry her more at tractive sister. The only live, human feeling that remains is a vague sexual yearning for his voluptuous daughter‐in‐law; but this last flicker has no warmth of sympathy or af fection and is totally different from the poignant obsession of Tanizaki's “mad old man.” Like Don Fabrizio in “The Leopard” he feels “the faculty of living ... ebbing out of him slowly but steadily”; in Shingo's ears the recurrent sound of the mountain from the back of his garden is the rumble of approaching death. Yet the sensuous awareness is unim paired: the wonder of the changing seasons, the hope; revolution in this novel is as much a personal quest as it is a social process. “Quarup” is a tragic ‐ comic novel (if one can be allowed a somewhat jaded designation), for the solutions it offers are, I think consciously, scarcely more plausible and less comic than the solutions it satirizes or condemns. Sheer craziness is, moreover, never far removed even from its more positive characters, and the author him self is resignedly prepared to risk being mad enough to be lieve that their craziness can ultimately be productive, if nothing else can. It is a pity that so absorbing a novel should be marred by a clumsy technique and by a flat unfertile style. But then An tonio Callado, who is a most talented and distinguished jour nalist and was himself a politi cal prisoner for a time, is here writing his first novel. ■ Correction In last week's issue “Fields of Peace: A Pennsylvania Ger man Album,” by Millen Brand and George A.

The public and private aspects of the problem,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/14/archives/the-public-and-private-aspects-of-the-problem-abortion.html,"Abortion, like the Middle East, has been the long time terrain of con flicting ideologies, which for all their sakes must learn to live together. Daniel Callahan, a Roman Catholic scholar and director of the Institute of Society, Ethics and the Life Sci ences, has written a comprehensive and scholarly book that examines the issues involved and the recent developments in the abortion area with considerable objectivity.  He concludes on the basis of his monumental research that “an ideal law . . would meet the following specifications: (1) It would permit abortion on request up to that point where the medical danger of abortion becomes a concern (normally about 12 weeks); thereafter serious reasons would be required and the decision would not wholly be the woman's (though her voice ought to continue, even then, to carry the greatest weight) . . . (2) It would offer but not require, prior to the abortion, a formal counseling process by at least one trained person other than the doctor who would perform the operation . . . (3) It would provide for free abortions for all women who desire an abortion, as well as provid ing free assistance of the kind needed to bear and raise a child if that option is chosen; (4) It would require a contraceptive counseling and as sistance process after an abortion was performed. The aim here would be to prevent further abortions; (5) It would include a ‘conscience clause’ for doctors and nurses as well as specifying those conditions under which a doctor could, on medical grounds, refuse to perform an abor tion . . . (6) It would require that all abortions be performed by trained medical personnel and be recorded for statistical purposes.” Mr. Callahan says, “This book has been an attempt to think through the problem of abortion.” This he has apparently done to his own satisfac tion but he starts, continues and concludes on the basis of an assump tion which it seems to me somewhat distorts the book and the problem. Obviously as Mr. Callahan sees “the problem of abortion” it goes to the root of human existence and its solu tion necessitates reaching conclusions about the fundamental nature of hu man life and the fundamental mean ing or meanings of the human con dition. In Mr. Callahan's words: “To think about abortion ought to be an exer cise in which one meditates not only on the available empirical evidence or the opinions and convictions of others, but also about oneself. What do I take to be the source of mean ing and value in the world? Where have my own ethical principles come from and how well have I thought them through? . . . How free have I been in my own thinking? Am I per haps a victim of my own history, whether that history is one in which I was shaped at an early age or one in which my present life space— my friends, my circle, my particular subculture—makes the decisive dif ference? What do I aspire to, both for myself and for my society?” Abortion Law, Choice and Morality. By Daniel Callahan. 524 pp. New York: The Macmillan Company. $14.95. Now these are good questions and all power to him who asks them of himself, But for many, probably most of us, resolution of “the prob lem of abortion” is not a matter which necessarily requires such basic and philosophical (religious?) self examination. Those of us who did not grow up in a rigid religious tradition which decries all abortion (even to save the life of the mother) as murder, look at abortion not primarily as philosophical problem the answer to which must probe our fundamental beliefs about life with a capital L, but as a social and health problem. We face it in terms not of theo retical aspects of human existence but in terms of freedom of choice as to when and whether to have a child—that freedom of choice which in matters relating to marriage, fam ily and sex is guaranteed to all Amer icans by the Constitution of the United States. Abortion as it is practiced in this country today is a grave public health problem—dramatized by the fact that while there are about 10,000 so‐called therapeutic abortions per formed in hospitals in the United States every year, it is estimated that there are probably at least one million out‐of‐hospital abortions, many of them performed by non doctors. Abortion today is also a problem of discrimination against the poor and minority groups. In one year in New York City for example 93 per cent of the “therapeutic, i.e., in‐hos pital abortions” were performed on white patients in private rooms. The ratio of in‐hospital abortions to live births in New York City was ap proximately one to 360 for private patients and something like one to 10,000 in municipal hospitals. At the same time the women whose deaths were associated with abortion in New York City in a typical year were 56 per cent black, 23 per cent Puerto Rican and 21 per cent white. Mr. Callahan makes clear that “the worst possible laws on abortion are those which are highly restrictive,” and he points out that “In the United States,” it may not be so “difficult in the long run to get abortion laws repealed or declared unconstitu tional.” Actually both are happening at a rapid rate. (Twelve states have passed reform laws — three states, Hawaii, Alaska and New York have repealed their anti‐abortion laws— courts in four states and the District of Columbia have declared their abor tion laws unconstitutional and test cases are pending in other states.) Mr. Callahan's book clearly derives from exhaustive scholarship and re search, and all persons interested in abortion and its place in today's world will want to read and ponder it. Mr. Callahan discusses medical, psychiatric and fetal indications for abortion “in different countries with different laws.” He comments on so cial attitudes and has read and clearly summarized the views and experi ences of persons specializing in this area all over the world. He proceeds to “Establishing a Moral Policy,” also exhaustively treated in terms of differing approaches and philo sophic viewpoints, which is followed by “Implementing a Moral Policy,” a fair part of which is devoted to “The Roman Catholic Position.” A writer, no matter how thorough, learned and honest (and Mr. Cal lahan is obviously all three), cannot do everything in the compass of one book, even on such a single subject as abortion. However, the lack of specifics and of any individualized material, renders the book no less authoritative but considerably less memorable than it might otherwise be. There are no people anywhere in this significant work about a highly personal subject. And while Mr. Calla han pays a great deal of attention to the laws and the statistics and the philosophical and moral issues in volved, one feels the lack of material showing how all these work out in specific hospitals, or clinics, or doc tors offices, for specific individuals. As our laws in the United States are repealed or liberalized or declared unconstitutional, it becomes clear that only half the battle is won and that public and professional attitudes and the will (or lack of will) to im plement the freedom conferred are also crucial. The Callahan book pays too little attention to the practical aspects of what he is talking about. For example, although his “ideal law” would include “a conscience clause” for doctors and nurses, it apparently would not include the obviously nec essary further requirement which most students of the question believe necessary, namely an obligation to refer the patient elsewhere if she is refused on conscience grounds. Mr. Callahan's own personal back ground makes “the problem of abortion” a very special one for him conceptu ally, and he tends to relegate the concrete day to day aspects of the problem to second place or ignore them entirely. But—as I said—neither Mr. Callahan nor any other author can do every thing in one book, and he has in fact accomplished a great deal in this one. Perhaps he—or someone else equally motivated and expert— will do another book that will focus on the practical problems of implementing freedom of choice in the abortion area. What factual conditions are necessary to the realistic exer cise of that freedom and how those conditions can best be brought about (e.g., how a suffi cient number of competent and nonjudgmental doctors, nurses and hospitals or clinics can be found), are also questions we need people of Mr. Callahan's calibre as a researcher and thinker to help us answer. ■",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All's Right With The World of Harold Wilson,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/14/archives/alls-right-with-the-world-of-harold-wilson-harold-wilsons-world.html,"LONDON. IN October, 1968, Harold Wilson flew down to Gibraltar to parley with Ian Smith, the Prime Min ister of rebel Rhodesia, aboard the British warship Fearless. It was an unpromising journey.  Mr. Wilson's Rhodesian policy, on which he had staked much, was an embarrassing failure: sanctions had not crushed the white minority's re bellion in weeks, as Mr. Wilson had promised, or months or years. In formed people thought there was no realistic chance of Ian Smith's agree ing to anything with the British Labor Government, and they proved right. And beyond Rhodesia it was a bad time for Harold Wilson. For a year, since devaluing the pound, he had been in a visibly depressed state —seeing few people outside his im mediate entourage, reluctant to ap pear on television, suspecting party plots against his leadership, almost paranoiac about the press. The polls indicated that, in a general election, Labor would be reduced to a rump in the House of Commons. But in Gibraltar, astonishingly, the Prime Minister bounced with good cheer. He invited the press aboard Fearless, called for drinks, introduced reporters to the captain, made little jokes and posed for tropical photos. What was going on, a bewildered observer asked one of Mr. Wilson's political intimates. “Oh, it's very simple,” this person replied. “Har old's just worked it out that he's going to win the election.” Did he really see his way out of the political despond at that low point? Or was it just some psycho logical turn that enabled him to shake off the depression? We cannot know, and it does not make all that much difference. For in Harold Wil son, illusion and reality are inter twined. When he thinks things are going wrong, he retreats into a con spiratorial gloom—and his political grip weakens. When he feels good, whether objective events justify that feeling or not, he positively radiates self‐confidence—and that is political ly effective. Right now his confidence has a basis. He has called a snap election for June 18, next Thursday, and Labor is the favorite to win. After years of bad showings in the opinion polls and local elections. Labor sud denly shot ahead in those indicators last month, to the general amaze ment of most pundits. The Wilsonian bravado—quite unbelievable in the autumn of 1968 and most of the time since—suddenly seemed justi fied. He called the election. In the weeks of campaigning since, the polls and the odds have fluctuated. But the Prime Minister still looks serene. The brass of Harold Wilson in the end is his most appealing charac teristic. For anyone who enjoys pol itics, there is something delightful in the way he bobs up after some awful defeat, like a heavy‐bottomed rubber doll, still smiling, pretending nothing has happened. A labor‐union man applied an old joke to him: “If Harold had been captain of the Ti tanic, he'd have convinced the pas sengers he'd just stopped to take on ice.” Naturally, not everyone loves the brazen quality. It drives some of his Conservative opponents wild, and there are many serious men in the Labor movement who despise Mr. Wilson for his bland abandonment of party doctrine and personal commit ments when he finds them inconven ient. He is probably the most hated party leader this country has had for a long time. Not that he Is a mean person. He is kind in his personal relations, he is brave, and he has the liberal in stincts of an ex‐Oxford don of lower middle‐class origin, which he is. The complaint against him is that he will stop at nothing to win. The most acute British political analyst, David Watt of The Financial Times, wrote last year: “He has no properly defined po litical principles to speak of, he is acutely suspicious, he is a poor judge of subordinates and he has a persistent if not incurable tendency to avert his gaze from unpleasant facts until they are thrust beneath his nose—at which point he usually overreacts.” In his nearly six years as Prime Minister there have been three par ticularly distasteful episodes. Or at least I found them so. One was the Government's de cision, in the winter of 1968, to de prive British citizens of Asian origin in East Africa of their right to enter Britain. When Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania were given their independ ence, the British Government offered the Asian residents a choice of local or British citizenship. Now, sudden ly, those who had taken up British passports were told that they were barred from their country of nation ality. Since Kenya and Uganda were gradually forcing out noncitizens, they found themselves men without a country. The Labor Government's sordid be trayal of a promise was the worse because it was unnecessary. Mr. Wil son and his Home Secretary, James Callaghan, panicked when a dissident right‐wing Conservative, Enoch Pow ell, began making scary speeches about floods of Kenya Asians enter ing Britain. Fearful of a racist back lash hurting Labor, they rushed the anti‐Asian bill through Parliament in a few days, without time for decent consideration and to the shame of many members. If they had stood up to Mr. Powell, the scare would prob ably have subsided in a few weeks. The pell‐mell legislation in fact ag gravated racist feelings in Britain, as was indeed inevitable from its premise— that British citizens with brown skin are worse than others. That episode was especially in structive because race had often been said to be the one subject on which Harold Wilson did have fixed liberal principles. Later, when a proposed visit to England by a white South African cricket team was a great issue, the Prime Minister exer cised his moral outrage; to introduce race into sport as the South Africans did, he said, was beyond the pale. Some wondered how they should characterize the introduction of race into citizenship. “The crucial change has been a growing sense of public con fidence in the ability of Labor—and Mr. Wilson to govern.” The second matter raising sharp moral doubts was a piece of gerry mandering — a practice familiar enough in political history, American or British, but this time especially crude. For the whole question of political boundaries was supposed to have been settled in a nonpartisan way, and the Labor Government just decided to ignore the rules when they might have hurt. After World War II, the parties agreed to deal with the whole ques tion of equality in voting districts in a nonpolitical way. The job of pe riodically redrawing the lines to keep districts more or less equal in popu lation was turned over to impartial boundary commissions. Their recom mendations were due to be carried out in 1969. But when the time came, Home Secretary Callaghan refused to act. He, and the Prime Minister, offered as an excuse the fact that local gov ernments might soon be reformed in Britain—but they did not even believe that themselves. Their real reason was that the unequal populations of the old districts gave Labor an ad vantage; reform would have given more seats to the Tory suburbs and probably lost Labor 20 places in the Commons. And the end, they reck oned, justified the means. That piece of cold‐blooded jobbery could be got away with because Britain has no written Constitution and no Supreme Court to make political leaders live up to standards of fairness. But Labor will pay a price. That agreed minimum of political decency has been violated, and some day there will be retribu tion. THEN there was the great D‐notice dispute. D‐notices are warnings given to the press that stories on certain subjects may violate security. They are issued, under an informal system of press ‐ Government cooperation quite unimaginable in the United States, by a joint committee of editors and officials. In February, 1967, The Daily Ex press carried a story saying that cables going out of Britain were being screened by the security au thorities. The story, by The Express defense correspondent, Chapman Pincher, did not add up to much new or interesting and seemed just a passing piece of pop sensationalism —until Mr. Wilson intervened. In the House of Commons one day he de nounced the story as a “clear breach of two D‐notices.” So much heat developed over the Prime Minister's charge that he ap pointed a distinguished committee under a noted judge, Lord Radcliffe, to investigate. The Radcliffe Commit tee found the Wilson charge erro neous: the Pincher story had not violated any outstanding D‐notices. The House of Commons then de bated the issue. Mr. Wilson, closing the debate, rejected his own com mittee's report and insisted that there had been a security violation. At 9:57 P.M., three minutes before the time for the debate ran out, he raised a new charge against the sec retary of the D‐notice committee, a retired colonel, Leslie Lohan. Colonel Lohan, he said, had been suspect because of overdose association with Chapman Pincher and had never had “full clearance” for security. Americans watching that scene from the gallery found it chillingly reminiscent of Senator Joe McCarthy. The Sunday Times of London said Mr. Wilson had chosen “to compound his arrogance with character assas sination” and had been “shabby, irresponsible and careless of truth.” It added: “The smear was daubed as to the manner born: a partial reading from an unidentified dossier carrying imprecise accusations of security risk and timed to prevent further inquiry.” Mr. Wilson's relationship with the press is a curiosity altogether. He came into office in October, 1964, with a reputation as a great friend of the press. It was said that he had broken with the old British political tradition of regarding report ers as among the lower orders, and would share a drink or a story. But as things went wrong for the Prime Minister, and the papers were more critical, he showed an extreme sen sitivity. He complained that British Broadcasting Corpora tion interviewers were biased against him. He kept files on individual political reporters and called their editors in to accuse them of what amount ed to conspiracies. Combined with this un pleasantness, from the press point of view, was something a little subtler. Mr. Wilson, even when he was being friendly, made a point of let ting reporters know that they were not to think of them selves as his equal, intellec tually or politically. He lec tured; he played cheap tricks with his trick memory for dates: “You will find the answer to that question in my speech of Nov. 14, 1955. . .” Often he refused to take serious questions seriously; he gave answers that treated the questioners as children. As a complete outsider, with no historical reason to be for or against Mr. Wilson or his party but a natural respect for a Prime Minister, I must confess to finding my self upset on more than one occasion by his tone of con tempt for the audience. Another American corres pondent, seeing him up close for the first time in 1967, wrote: “He was supercilious, arrogant; he toyed with the questions.” BUT the truth is that such personal press reactions in all likelihood matter not at all in politics. Nor are those three moral failures of the Wilson Government — on gerryman dering, the Kenya Asians and the D‐notice affair — signifi cant in terms of votes. There are some Labor party in tellectuals deeply and per manently offended by the craven racist appeal of the Asian exclusion legislation; one said to me recently that as long as Harold Wilson was leader of the party, he would spoil his ballot by writing an anti‐Wilson obscenity across it. But that must be the view of a tiny minority. In politics, and statecraft, the real tests of the Wilson years have to be foreign policy and economics. They have been crucial years of transition for Britain, with the painful loss of empire, and Mr. Wilson applied his special mixture of fantasy and pragmatism. In foreign policy, Wilson the illusionist kept alive for years the myth of Britain as a great power. He loved the idea of a world role, and would talk of his influence at the “top tables” of interna tional discussion with an embarrassingly simple boast fulness: “They are listening to Britain now. We are right there at the top table” (1965). He flew off to Washington or Moscow with notions of how to end the Vietnam war, annoying Lyndon Johnson and making no great mark on the Russians. (He might actually have got somewhere with Premier Kosygin of the U.S.S.R. on one occasion— the Kosygin visit to London in 1967 — if President John son had not made a last minute change in a plan for ending the bombing of North Vietnam and beginning talks.) He flew to Nigeria for an empty gesture at ending that civil war. He flew to Rhodesia. When short of political news, he suddenly promised a “Commonwealth initiative” against famine in India, of which almost nothing was ever heard again. “We are in Europe,” he said in 1966, “but our power and influence are not and must never be confined to Europe.” That illusion of the world role died hard. It was killed by necessity after de valuation of the pound at the end of 1967. The new Chan cellor of the Exchequer, Roy Jenkins, who had long argued that the attempt to remainv a power in Asia and the Middle East was beyond Britain's resources, now prevailed. On Jan. 16, 1968, a pained Harold Wilson had to tell the House of Commons: “Our security lies funda mentally in Europe. . . . [After 1971] we shall not be main taining military bases outside Europe and the Mediter ranean.” But the even more profound Wilsonian reversal of position came on the European ques tion itself — British member ship in the Common Market. Mr. Wilson was a long‐time opponent of the idea. As late as March, 1966, during that election campaign, he ridiculed the Conservative pro‐Market leadership as a “spaniel” roll ing on its back to get in and said Britain should not enter unless given the right to go on buying Commonwealth food and raw materials with out change — an impossible condition. Then, in the autumn of 1966, he became a convert. He toured the Continent preaching the gospel of Euro peanism. Unless Britain and the Market got together to resist American domination, he said, they would fall vic tims to a new “industrial helotry.” He even persuaded himself that he could brush aside Charles de Gaulle's op position to Britain joining the Six; but only now, after de Gaulle, are the negotiations about to begin. “It surely takes ex ceptional incompe tence for an opposition to let a government recover from mistakes of Mr. Wilson'sorder.” FROM the moment of tak ing office, Mr. Wilson made the continuance of close rela tions with the United States his number one priority in foreign affairs. That would be the instinct of any Prime Minister. In his case the in stinct was sharpened by the fact that American support— and money—were essential in the fight for the pound. Vietnam was the difficulty. The left of the Labor party was deeply opposed to Presi dent Johnson's escalation of the war, and over the years that discontent spread right through the party. Mr. Wilson dealt with it, at first, by arguing that he could be a restraining influence on Mr. Johnson if he were not pushed to an open break. Since such influence was hard to detect, the argument gradually lost plausibility. For a period many informed Englishmen had a sense that their Prime Minister was fawning on the President, and accepting Vietnam hor rors, for financial reasons. Robert Kennedy, on a visit to London in 1967, told British//friends: “Your politics are losing interest because you don't stand for anything. Agree or disagree with America's posi tion in Vietnam, but do it because you believe it, not to save the pound.” Public discontent about Vietnam subsided in Britain, as in the United States, until President Nixon's decision to strike into Cambodia. Mr. Wilson dealt with his political problem then by expressing concern and saying he hoped the Cambodian adventure would not interfere with the Nixon troop‐withdrawal pro gram. This seemed to calm the left, perhaps partly be cause everyone realizes now that Britain has little or no influence over American pol icy. If strong British criticism could ever have moderated the U.S. course in Vietnam, the time is past. Accordingly, there are few votes to be won or lost here now on Vietnam. Mr. Wilson's foreign‐policy record is full of airs and inconsistencies, even absurdi ties. But still, it has come out about right in the essentials —or right as the conventional liberal wisdom sees it. Britain has dropped her pretensions to world power and is seek ing her place in Europe. Harold Wilson was certainly slow to see those necessities, but so was his country. And some might think that his bumbling journey to reality enabled Britain to adjust to a dimi nished role relatively pain lessly. THE economic record of the Wilson Government is even more dramatic in its incon sistencies. Within a few days of winning office by a hand ful of seats in 1964, the Cabinet decided firmly not to devalue. It was a decision out of pride and weakness, a wrong decision for which Britain paid dearly over the next three years in resources drained to pay the trading deficits and keep the pound at $2.80. A severe crunch came in the summer of 1966. A seven‐ week seamen's strike hit at exports and hurt foreign con fidence in sterling, already fragile. Mr. Wilson, frantic, denounced the strike leaders as Communists; eventually the strike was settled anyway. In July, 1966, the Prime Minister made a remarkable speech in which he blamed the country's financial troub les on “the defeatist fringe . . ., the sell‐Britain‐short bri gade . . ., the moaning ninnies and wet editorials.” Within a few days he announced dras tic new deflationary measures and a six‐month wage freeze to save the pound. The Cabi net had again, repeating its mistake, rejected professional economic advice to devalue. As late as October, 1967, Mr. Wilson was privately giv ing assurance that the balance of payments was fundamen tally sound and sterling safe. A month later the continuing decline of foreign confidence forced devaluation. Mr. Wilson's public com ments on that crushing defeat of his central policy were masterpieces of self‐pity and evasion of responsibility. The night of devaluation he went on television and said it had been done to avoid the “irre sponsible” course of borrow ing more abroad instead, and to avoid “rigid limitations on the ability of our people and Government to solve our problems.” Some time later, asked by a television panel whether he had made any mis takes, he said yes, he had to admit one: he had under estimated the determination of the speculators against the pound! The credibility of the Prime Minister and his Government suffered blows in the devalua tion from which it seemed unlikely ever to recover. A long, dark period followed in which respect for Mr. Wilson fell so low that he was por trayed in a stage satire—in London's West End, not some college theater—as a para noiac bungler dressed in a baggy batman suit. In the middle of 1969 there was a further blow. Mr. Wilson decided to stake his Government on a bold new program to curb that peren nial British plague, the wild cat strike. He proposed legis lation. The unions, which supply most of the Labor party's money and much of its manpower, said nay. Mr. Wilson insisted. But by June his parliamentary party and finally his Cabinet were against him, and there was talk of forcing him from the party leadership and 10 Downing Street. He surren dered. NOW it is just a year later, and the ignominy of that episode is dim and distant. The pound is strong, Harold Wilson is bubbling and Labor is the favorite in an election campaign. What happened? First, it has to be said that Mr. Wilson took his defeat on the union‐reform legislation with a chipper grace, without recrimination. He showed none of the bitterness that, for example, President Nixon displayed over the Senate's rejection of his Supreme Court nominees. He even kept in his Cabinet the man who had publicly opposed the union bill and had been con sidered a challenger for his job, James Callaghan. He adjusted to political realities with the suppleness of Byron's Julia, who, whispering she would ne'er consent — con sented. Party unity was restored. More important, much more, the Prime Minister had a shrewd and determined colleague who at last made a success of Britain's finances: Roy Jenkins, the Chancellor of the Exchequer. He took the job after devaluation and promised only “two years' hard slog.” As that time ran out, many still doubted that the prescription would work. But then, staggeringly, spec tacularly, the balance of payments went into the black. The fight that successive political leaders had made Britain's test of manhood had apparently been won. Just how the economic miracle has occurred is not certain, but then it never is. What is clear is that British exports were given a power ful boost by devaluation, as intended. At the same time Mr. Jenkins held down im ports by tough suppression of domestic demand — high in terest rates, tight controls on Government spending, sharply increased taxes. In short, orthodox measures. There may still be doubts about the British performance in the long run. Wage rates are going up; they are in all countries, but productivity still tends to rise less briskly in Britain than in Germany or the United States or Japan. That is a long‐run concern, but for now the balance of payments certainly can be claimed as a triumph for Mr. Jenkins and Labor. Mr. Jenkins became a sym bol of nonpolitical rectitude. This spring he produced a budget that, despite the favor able payments picture, gave few tax concessions. The Con servatives thought he had hurt Labor's chances, only to discover that the public (ac cording to polls) enjoyed being treated in an adult way. With the pound, other as pects of government have begun to look right. The crucial change has been a growing sense of public con fidence in the ability of Labor to govern. Others aside from Mr. Jenkins have a reputation for competence, among them Denis Healey, the defense minister, and Anthony Cros land, the first environmental overlord. Mr. Wilson's funda mental objective all along has been to make Labor seem the natural governing party. He is certainly on the way to achieving that—hard as it would have been to imagine a ago. One word that does not ap pear in this impressionistic survey of Harold Wilson's record and aims — and does not much appear on his lips either—is socialism. Mr. Wil son does still talk about social justice; his Government has somewhat enlarged the share of Britain's resources going to public needs, though not enough to please those who fight poverty. But in general, these days, the Wilson posture is that of a defender of the status quo. He is appealing to satisfied voters. It is the Con servatives who want sharp changes—in the tax system, unions, farm‐price supports, defense, business manage ment. MR. WILSON has been lucky in his opponents. That must be true of most success ful politicians. But it surely takes exceptional incompe tence for an opposition to let a government recover from mistakes of Mr. Wilson's order. Edward Heath, the leader of the Opposition, was chosen by the Conservatives in the hope that he would be able to match Harold Wilson as a cutthroat politician. He was a grammar‐school boy, the son of a carpenter, self‐made, a long way from the Tory tradition of inherited ease. Alas, Mr. Heath has turned out simply uneasy. He has neither the rough edge of Harold Wilson's tongue nor the deep natural confidence of an old‐fashioned Tory. Mr. Heath is mincemeat for the Prime Minister in the House of Commons. Again and again he is unable to resist getting up and trying to down Mr. Wilson with some question, only to find himself awash in mockery. The other week the Prime Minister took so long over some answer to Mr. Heath that Conservative back‐bench ers carped. Mr. Wilson, hardly breaking his stride, remarked: “I've at last got him up. I must be allowed to enjoy it.” Perhaps it is lack of con fidence that has let Mr. Heath allow himself to be pushed steadily to the right in his own party, as many believe he has. On such issues as attitudes toward Rhodesia and South Africa, and now in emphasizing the need for more “law and order” in this still remarkably law‐abiding country, he presents an in creasingly right‐wing image. A radical‐minded former Conservative M.P., Humphry Berkeley, has said that the rightward trend in the party may make him vote Labor: “The Conservative party ap pears to me to be going out of its way to affront intellectual and enlightened opinion. . . .” Mr. Berkeley and others who would call themselves civil libertarians are con cerned especially about race relations in Britain, where there is now a significant minority of West Indian, Indian and Pakistani immi grants. They care also about some of the social‐reform measures that a Labor major ity in the Commons has made possible, though the bills were not officially sponsored by the Government: the end of capital punishment and thea ter censorship, easier abortion and divorce. Those bothered by some of Mr. Wilson's callous changes of view will not draw much comfort from the Heath line. He and most of his party voted for the legislation abandoning a promise made to the Kenya Asians by a Conservative Government. He was lukewarm, at best, on urgently ‐ needed legislation against racial discrimination —a wise attempt to avoid America's follies in this area. Mr. Wilson may have come late to the dropping of world power fantasies; Mr. Heath wants to send British troops back to bases east of Suez. In economic matters, Mr. Heath has been treated a little unjustly by fate. In the 1966 election campaign he spoke the truth about Britain's desperate situation but made few friends by doing so. Now he is rightly pointing to the dangers of runaway wage in flation—union settlements are zooming out of sight in Britain as in the United States—but bigger pay packets in the pocket are likely to bring Labor voters out. He may be right also in saying that Britain could meet housing and other social needs better by being more selective with public funds, but this arouses old emotions about means tests. HAROLD WILSON ABROAD There is a further irony here. Mr. Heath, as a Tory leader in the efficient new managerial image, has pro duced a whole set of Con servative policies to deal with such matters as strikes. They need dealing with. But an opposition may make a mis take in producing a firm program that can be a target, instead of just denouncing the Government's failures. Mr. Wilson has taken the Heath plan for strikes and labor reform and built from this and other straws an image of a cold party, a heartless group of men who would let the social gains of recent years slip away. The Conservatives want a more competitive society. Britain undoubtedly could be more productive, more eco nomically efficient. But look ing these days at the most productive country on earth, the United States, Britons may feel that their own so ciety—less efficient but more comfortable, more relaxed— may have a lot to say for it. And Harold Wilson, who once advertised himself as the knife edge of the new tech nology, is now above all the comfortable man. And here Mr. Heath has a personal image problem. He is a shy man, essentially insecure, and this often trans lates into seeming brusque ness. He can be charming and sensitive, especially when in volved in the loves of his life —music and sailboats — but he can also seem cold, even sneering. And the fact that he has never married has undoubtedly hurt him deeply with the public. One more difficulty, per haps again an unfair one: Edward Heath hates Harold Wilson. Long ago he made clear that he considered the Prime Minister a bounder; he has used such words as “maniac.” The British political tradition is not congenial to such stark views; and besides, hate is not a way to good judgment in any aspect of life. Such drastic emotions do not enter Into politics for Harold Wilson. It is all fun and games. A few weeks ago when he was answering ques tions in the House, he seized on some question to begin quoting at length a recent television appearance of his. When a Tory angrily asked, “Have you got the text of it there, then?”, Mr. Wilson snapped cheerfully back: “Yes—I knew someone would be daft enough to ask.” In this easy‐going posture he is now, effectively, the conservative candidate in an election that for Britain is unusually focused on the two major party leaders. It is Mr. Heath who wants to change things, Mr. Wilson who says the country is doing fine. That all of this has very little to do with socialism or Labor party principle does not bother him; nor does the fact that he is really running on Roy Jen kins's success at financial orthodoxy. THE campaign has been marked by large amounts of apathy. With Mr. Heath rail ing at high prices but not say ing what he would do about them, and Mr. Wilson puffing his pipe into the cameras, public indifference is not too surprising. Labor strategists figure that should help them, in light of Mr. Wilson's per sonal hold on the voters: if unaroused by issues, they should vote for him. The risk is of “Dewey complacency.” Mr. Wilson knows that, if it were not for him, Labor would not even be in the picture. He had the nerve to hold the party together for 18 months, govern with a majority of three in the House and then win big in 1966. One of his colleagues, definitely not a personal friend or admirer, said in his darkest days: “Don't underestimate the real steel that lies under the surface — the guts, the stamina, the character of Harold Wilson—even though he might not strike you so well.” When one thinks of that, some of the embarrassing turns in policy seem less hor rifying than they did at the time. And for the lover of politics, sheer amazement at Harold Wilson's survival may give sneaking pleasure. He is a bit like camp decor — so funny, so transparent that one succumbs in spite of oneself. In a particularly candid moment in the Commons this spring, Mr. Wilson said: “However tired people may be of me, I think most people will regard me as the lesser of two evils.” He may very well be right.■",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DRUG USE IS HELD NO CRIME ‘PER SE’,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/14/archives/drug-use-is-held-no-crime-per-se-aclu-conference-sees-a-right-to.html,"The biennial conference of the American Civil Liberties Un ion has overwhelmingly adopted a resolution declaring that the possession and use of drugs does not — by itself — con stitute a crime and should not invoke criminal penalties.  The resolution is one of five relating to drugs passed by the conference on June 5 at a meet ing at New York University. The conference is composed of delegates from the civil‐rights organization's 48 affiliates as well as its board of directors. The resolutions, which are not binding, will be forwarded to the board of directors fox consideration. A spokesman for the A.C.L.U. said that the board, which numbers about 70 members, was scheduled to meet next in September but might not necessarily deal with the resolutions at that time. ‘Right to Use Own Body’ The biennial conference is the organization's major body for consideration of policy, and its resolutions on drug policy be gan with these words: “Resolved, that an individual has a right to use his own body as he wishes and that this right includes the use and pos session of narcotics.” The conference then adopted the resolution declaring that the use and possession of drugs is not a crime “per se” and should not bring criminal penal ties. However, the resolution continued, “conduct resulting from the use or possession of drugs may invoke civil or crim inal penalties.” This resolution was passed by a 103‐to‐11 vote, with five absentions. A third resolution recognized the right of the Government to regulate drugs, including reg ulation by means of a monop oly on the sale of drugs. The conference also resolved “that compulsory treatment or in carceration of drug users is a violation of civil liberties.” No Position on Juveniles In a final resolution on the subject of drugs, the confer ence limited the preceding four resolutions to adults and rec ommended that no position be taken on the right of juveniles to use and possess drugs. But it recommended that a compre hensive study of the rights of juveniles in drugs and other fields be instituted. Sheldon Ackley, administra tive assistant to the president of the State University at Stony Brook, who served as chairman of the conference, noted that the A.C.L.U had in recent years begun to develop concepts of privacy. He said that “this is especially impor tant as big government comes on the scene.” Mr. Ackley said that the stand on drugs represented a logical extension of earlier statements on birth control and abortion: “that matters having to do with ourselves, not other people, are of no concern to the state, even if they are self destructive.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Saturday, continuing all night long and all day and night Sunday. Electronic music, African music, gospel music, music of the American Wind Symphony Orchestra, Hindu music, coun try dancing, a performance of Jean‐Claude van Itallie's “The Serpent,” and square dancing were performed on the Wind Symphony barge, moored in the Allegheny River. Panel discussions on new directions in music, the theater, and film, ecology, police‐com munity relations, welfare and abortion were conducted. At 5 A.M. yesterday a specially illuminated light show and sun rise service with rock music were presented for the several hundred people who had re mained overnight on chairs, in bleachers or had reposed, blanketed on the ground in the park. The park, at Pittsburgh's Point where the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers converge to form the Ohio, has become a haven for hippies and it was obvious that they ap preciated the performance. One of the highlights of the event was Babatunde Olatunji and his Nigerian dancers, who per formed a half‐hour program at 9:30 P.M. Saturday and from 2 A.M. until 2:30 A.M. yester day. Olatunji, a Nigerian now living in New York, led his performers in African dances of welcome, the harvest, New Year's dance, and a chal lenge dance.

TRUDEAU DEBATES MILITANT WOMEN,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/16/archives/trudeau-debates-militant-women-discussion-of-abortion-is-harsh-and.html,"VANCOUVER, British Colum bia, June 15—Canadian wom en militants debated with Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau last night their view that the Government should repeal the criminal code penalties against abortions.  Some 60 members of the Vancouver Women's Caucus, part of the loosely knit Women's Liberation movement, hammered at the Prime Min ister for 90 minutes, from 10:30 until midnight, in a hot, crowd ed hotel room. The women, nearly all seem ingly under 25 years old, had conducted a motorized caravan across Canada in May to pub licize their view on abortion, had shackled themselves to the seats in the House of Commons gallery, forcing it to recess while attendants removed them, and had challenged Mr. Tru deau at a news conference here 10 days ago. Legislation Criticized During the meeting, the women charged that hospitals were not performing abortions for all women who wanted them. The women criticized as restrictive 1969 legislation that authorized a therapeutic abor tion if a hospital panel of three doctors recommended it to save a woman's life or health. The Prime Minister said he doubted that Canadians wanted to let women have abortion “on demand,” as the Women's Lib eration movement advocated. “Laws have to correspond to the public morality,” Mr. Tru deau said. “It's up to you to change the public morality.” The Prime Minister, who had spent part of the day surfing, came to the meeting wearing tan slacks, a yellow pullover shirt and a windbreaker. He listened to speeches and questions on abortion, drug company profits and birth con trol. He was frequently inter rupted in his answers. After a complaint that there were too few women doctors, Mr. Trudeau responded: “You're trying to change the mentality of society and I'm trying to help you because I don't think women have a square deal in society.” He did not elaborate. Denies Law is Cause Mr. Trudeau asserted the women's grievance lay not with the law but with the doctors and with “public morality.” “Most doctors apparently, and this includes women doc tors, don't want to be in the status of being abortionists,” he said. He recalled that there had been intense opposition to a package of criminal‐code amendments in 1969, including the legalization of homosexual acts by consulting adults, oppo sition so intense that it had tied up the House of Com mons for three weeks. Much of the opposition to liberalizing the code's abortion section came from members representing Quebec, which is predominantly Roman Catholic. Trudeau himself comes from Quebec and got strong support there in the 1968 par liamentary election. “How do you know you speak for the women of Can ada?” he challenged. The wom en reasserted their claim that 200,000 Canadian women each year had illegal abortions. “That will elect about four M.P.'s,” Mr. Trudeau said. Chairman Ineffective The mild‐mannered young woman who tried to function as chairman was largely in effective and the Prime Minis ter was repeatedly interrupted by women seething with indigna tion. When one women ap pealed for courtesy, another de nounced her, using an obscen ity. Several times during the en counter, the Prime Minister's mouth tightened, his eyes brightened and his tone hard ened in apparent anger and appeared that he would walls out. But he stayed until the the meeting, when one of then qustioned the Prime Minister' sincerity.

Priest in Massachusetts Is Opposed as Politician,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/17/archives/priest-in-massachusetts-is-opposed-as-politician.html,"NEWTON, Mass, June 15— At the Massachusetts Demo cratic Convention last weekend a woman approached the Rev. Robert F. Drinan and told him she could not vote for him be cause he was a priest and be longed in a parish, not in pol itics.  Father Drinan, a 49‐year‐old Jesuit priest, is an author, a legal scholar, dean of the Boston College Law School—and a can didate in the Sept. 15 Demo cratic primary for a seat in the House of Representatives. The seat is held by Philip J. Tthilbin, now 72, who has been in Congress for 27 years. In his best pastoral manner, the priest told the woman that Protestant clergymen had been serving in Congress for almost 200 years. And he asked her whether she, as a Roman Cath olic, wanted to exclude clergy men of her faith from politics while permitting Protestants to take part. She said she would have to think about it. But Father Drinan had clearly scored a debating point. He will have to score many during the next three months if he is to beat Mr. Philbin, a white‐haired New Deal liberal who serves as vice chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. ‘Unthinking Rubber Stamp’ Representative Philbin is a hawk. Father Drinan calls him “an unthinking rubber stamp” for the committee's conserva tive chairman, Representative L. Mendel Rivers, Democrat of South Carolina. Father Drinan is a witty, out spoken dove who was chosen to oppose Mr. Philbin by a cau cus of antiwar Democrats. The caucus included people from all parts of the district, which stretches from Newton and Weston in Boston's affluent western suburbs to Winchen don, 50 miles away on the New Hampshire border. For the caucus members— such people as Jerome Gross man, the envelope manu facturer who provided a major share of the financing for the Vietnam Moratorium — war versus peace is the paramount issue. The same is true, no doubt, for, others in the dis trict. But for many middle and lower class Catholics, especial ly in the western part of the district, the key question is the propriety of a priest running for Congress. No priest has ever been elected to the House although the Rev. Gabriel Richard was appointed a dele gate in 1822 from what was then the Michigan Territory. A poll taken for The Boston Globe by the Becker Research Corporation in April gave Mr. Philbin 40 per cent of the vote, with 21 per cent for Father Drinan, 8 per cent for a third candidate, State Representative Charles Ghanian, and 31 per cent undecided. Not Discouraging For a neophyte running against a well‐established in cumbent, those figures are not discouraging. But the Globe survey also indicated that 30 per cent of the respondents considered it improper for a priest to run. It is not impossible to gauge whether those who take that view would be anti‐Drinan in any case. He said in an inter view they “use it as a cover for their conservatism.” But even the antiwar Jews and Protestants who crowded into the Auburndale Congrega tional Church in Newton on Sunday night to hear Father Drinan showed some apprehen sion, asking repeated questions about abortion, birth control and the priesthood. He explained his generally lib eral views on each subject, called for immediate withdraw al from Southeast Asia, and hammered away at “emergence of death” in the armaments industry. Mr. Philbin, who lives in rural Clinton, has not cam paigned extensively, but he is clearly vulnerable. Reappor tionment in 1967 added urban voters to his district, and in 1968 he won the primary with only 49.9 percent of the vote in a four‐way race. But, says Father Drinan's campaign manager, John Mart tila, “Philbin obviously has lots of credit cards out after 27 years.” Mr. Marttila, who is from Detroit, worked for the Republican National Committee until he quit last March in dis gust at the Nixon ad ministration. Mr. Marttila has enlisted hun dreds of local Democrats and students in an attempt to can vass all the district's 80,000 Democrats (75 per cent are Catholic) and 100,000 inde pendents (independents can, but generally do not, vote in party primaries in Massachusetts). Having identified potential Drinan supporters, he hopes to get them to the polls Sept. 15. “When Kent State hap pened,” said Anne Marie Gog gin, 21, a June graduate of Regis College in Weston, “it told some kids that the system was so ugly that the only answer was violence. “It told me and a lot of my friends that the forces of the status quo were strong and ruthless enough to put down any opposition, and that will mean only the senseless loss of more lives. To us, people like Father Drinan seem the only way.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3 U.S. Judges Rule Laws on Abortion Invalid in Texas,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/18/archives/3-us-judges-rule-laws-on-abortion-invalid-in-texas.html,"DALLAS, June 17 (AP)—Tex as' abortion laws were declared unconstitutional today by a three‐judge Federal panel that said the statutes infringed on the right of women to choose whether they wanted to bear children.  The judges acted on a suit brought by a pregnant, unmar ried woman, a married couple and a physician facing two criminal abortion charges. The ruling was that the fundamental right of a single woman or a married couple to choose whether to have children was protected by the Ninth through Fourteenth Amend ments. Texas law holds that any per son instrumental in causing an abortion with the woman's con sent can be jailed for two to five years. Abortion produced without the woman's consent is punishable by four to 10 years in prison. Murder charges may be filed, under Texas law, when death occurs during an abortion attempt. The judges stated the Texas laws were “overbroad” and “vague” and did not properly define for physicians what con stituted criminal abortion lia bility. “Freedom to choose in the matter of abortions has been accorded the status of ‘fundamental right,’ “the ruling stated. On the panel were Appeals Judge Irvin L. Goldberg and Federal District Judges Sarah T. Hughes and William Taylor Jr. A spokesman for the Texas Medical Association said that the law permitted a legal abor tion to save the life of the mother, with no further quali fications or guidelines. Attempts for liberalized abor tion laws were defeated in the last two Texas legislative ses sions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
L.I. Bishop Warns Of Catholic Canon Against Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/19/archives/li-bishop-warns-of-catholic-canon-against-abortions.html,"ROCKVILLE CENTRE, L. I., June 18 — Roman Catholic physicians, nurses and other medical personnel on Long Is land were forbidden today, un der penalty of excommunica tion, to perform or otherwise take part in abortions. A new state law, effective July 1, generally permits abor tions if consented to by the woman and her physician. A set of guidelines issued by the Most Rev. Walter P. Kellen berg, Bishop of the Rockville Centre Diocese, which compris es Nassau and Suffolk Counties, states that the new statute “does not change the immoral ity of abortional acts.” “Direct killing of the inno cent, whether born or unborn,” Bishop Kellenberg said, “is against the law of God.” In general, Roman Catholic physicians do not perform abor tions and Catholic nurses do not assist in their performance. Nor are they required to do so by the change in the New York State abortion law or by any other liberalized abortion law in this country. Guidelines issued by the city's and state's Health Departments allow medical personnel to ex empt themselves from partici pating in abortions for relig ious, moral or ethical reasons. The diocesan guidelines say Roman Catholic medical per sonnel should make known their “conscientious inability to take part in such operations.” They also say that Catholics should refuse to participate in experi ments on aborted fetuses and that the fetuses should receive infant baptism. According to the church's canon law, the Bishop said, those who procure abortion, not excepting the mother, will be excommunicated. The Bishop's guidelines also bar Roman Catholics from ad vising a woman to have an abortion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Primaries May Decide Control of Legislature,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/19/archives/primaries-may-decide-control-of-legislature.html,"ALBANY, June 18—Over shadowed by other campaigns, men and women who will help shape New York's future are fighting out key contests for party control in legislative dis tricts across the state. The primary elections in 150 Assembly and 57 Senate Dis tricts June 23 preface elections in November that will deter mine who controls the two houses of the Legislature. Dem ocratic legislative strategists concede that the Republicans' nine‐vote margin of control of the Senate seems secure. But they hope to win control of the Assembly now Republican by a slender three votes above the 76 necessary for control. The latest figures from boards of election around the state in dicate that there are 102 races in which party members are op posing one another for a chance to run for the Legislature in November. Of these, 75 involve fights among Democrats, and 27 involve Republicans. 1971 an Important Year Legislative control is espe cially important in 1971, for it is this Legislature that will use the 1970 Federal census figures to draw new legislative and Congressional district lines —a task that will strongly in fluence the political coloration of these districts for the next decade. While the real decision will not come until the November elections, certain trends are de veloping in the primaries that could prove to be important in future political developments. “One very interesting trend,”, a Democratic party spokesman said recently, “is the number of Republican candidates who also have Conservative party en dorsement.” In the Assembly races, 47 Republicans are the choice also of the Conservative party. In the Legislature now there are nine Republican members of the Assembly who owe their elec tions to the number of votes obtained on the Conservative line. They have been credited with wielding a powerful con servative influence on the Leg islature on all crucial votes be cause they held the balance of power in the Republican ma jority. Some of the Democratic pri mary contests could be costly to the party in November, like the race of 37‐year‐old Assem blyman Arthur O. Eve in Buf falo. Dr. Eve, a Democrat and a black leader in Erie County, has been fighting with the local Democratic organization for years. This year is no different and his opponent, John Smith, has the support of Joseph F. Crangle, the Erie County Demo cratic chairman, is also a key figure in the campaign of Ar thur J. Goldberg for the Demo cratic nomination for Governor. “The only way we can beat Eve this year is by an outpour ing of the Polish votes on the fringes of his district, and that's not going to happen,” a Democratic party official said recently. Democrats are having trouble with another seat in the middle of the state, where Assembly man George Michaels is fight ing his party for re‐election. Mr. Michaels, whose vote was the key to passing the abortion reform bill, was denied party backing and later was seriously injured in an automobile acci dent, but he is still fighting for the nomination in the primary. Mr. Michaels is opposed by John C. Rossi, who picked up the local party endorsement immediately after the Auburn Assemblyman voted for the abortion bill. The district has a heavy Roman Catholic con stituency, and the reaction to his abortion vote is generally believed to have led to his troubles with party leaders. Lively Brooklyn Situation Finally, challenging among Democrats is nowhere more noticeable than in Brooklyn, the largest, Democratic strong hold in the country. Of the 19 Democratic Assembly seats in Brooklyn, only two incumbents have won renomination from the Democratic party without a primary fight. But all the problems do not belong to the Democratic party. Republicans in the Newburgh area are being asked to deny the renomination to State Sen ator D. Clinton Dominick, Sen ate sponsor of the abortion reform bill. Mr. Dominick's challenge comes from the con servative wing of the party and is based in part on his liberal record in the Senate. His opponent is Richard E. Schermerhorn, who is making his first bid for public office. Another high‐ranking Repub lican Senator, William E. Adams of Buffalo, is under attack with in his party. Mr. Adams was recently cleared by a Federal Court of charges of perjury in connection with investigations into the passage of state leg islation and rumored bribes of public officials. Mr. Adams's campaign has attracted two opponents—Mrs Larraine Mroz and Thomas T Basil. But he has retained the full support of the party organ ization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abortion Service Starting July 1 To Offer Advice,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/20/archives/abortion-service-starting-july-1-to-offer-advice.html,"Planned Parenthood of New York City announced yesterday that a citywide abortion infor mation and referral service would be in operation on July 1, when the state's new abor tion law takes effect. The serv ice will advise women on abor tions and refer them to doc tors and hospitals willing and able to perform the operations.  The service can be reached by calling 777‐4504, a 16‐ trunk line to be manned by 10 persons, about half of whom will be nurses, according to Alfred F. Moran, executive vice president of the organiza tion. He described the service at a news conference at the Overseas Press Club, 54 West 40th Street. At the same conference, the Rev. Howard R. Moody of Jud son Memorial Church announced the formation of a watchdog or ganization to “keep records on how and why the system breaks down for women seeking abor tions.” The organization, the Clergy and Lay Advocates for Hospital Abortion Performance, will keep track of complaints from women calling 477‐0034, or the Planned Parenthood number. The Planned Parenthood service will be supplemented by another four ‐ trunk line, 777‐2015, the current Family Planning Information Service. The association anticipates that 8,000 to 10,000 women will contact them for abortion in formation each month. Mr. Moody said he was pessimistic about how well the abortion law would be imple mented by hospitals. He called the city Health Department's recommendation that abortions be done only in hospital's “un necessarily restrictive” and bound to drive many women seeking abortions to the “back streets.” Gordon E. Brown, executive director of the State Commu nities Aid Association, which sponsored the conference, said personal “soundings” he had made among hospitals upstate revealed that in a number of areas the hospitals had done virtually nothing to prepare to meet the anticipated demand for abortions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MERGER IS SOUGHT BY PRESBYTERIANS,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/21/archives/merger-is-sought-by-presbyterians-talks-on-unity-extended-at-110th.html,"MEMPHIS, June 20 — The Presbyterian Church in the United States a historically Southern and traditionally con servative communion, sprinkled its annual meeting here this week with generous dashes of liberalism as it inched hesitant ly toward a reconciliation with its sister denomination in the North.  The church's 110th general assembly, which ended here last night, took several actions in contrast to its early theology, which excluded slavery from its spiritual considerations and in sisted that problems of society and points of religion were un related. On the issue of unity, the church, born in the fragmenta tions of the Civil War, approved the continuation of ecumenical conversations with the United Presbyterian Church in the U. S. A., often called “the, Northern church.” It also ap proved further participation in the Consultation on Church Union, a group seeking to weld a single communion from nine denominations. On social issues, the repre sentatives of the church's one million members conceded their church's involvment in racism, presented a memorial service honoring the late Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., affirmed a moral justification for abor tion, offered an opinion on the Vietnam war, described the con sumptiono f alcoholic bever ages as a matter of individual conscience and created a caucus of black Presbyterians. The caucus of black Presby terians was voted a first year allotment of $25,000. It is also to be supported by proceeds from a special offering to be collected in the churches Oct. 18. The extension of the merger negotiations was interpreted by many as a victory for those who support such a union; but the assembly's deliberations did not include any mention of when the two churches might actually vote on such a merger. Neither has any timetable been established for the efforts of the Consultation on Church Union, a 10‐year‐old creation of the Rev. Dr. Eugene Carson Blake, general secretary of the World Council of Churches. Despite the movement toward a more liberal orientation, the conservative elements of the church made their presence known throughout the six‐day meeting of the some 450 com missioners representing “South ern Presbyterians” in 16 states from Maryland to Texas. “We've been seen and heard, I think,” said Dr. Robert Strong, of Montgomery, Ala., a clergyman generally recog nized as a leader of the church's conservative bloc. “We have dissented honestly and honorably and we shall do so again according to our con sciences.” Dr. Strong often serves as a spokesman for those in the church who are opposed to a merger with the northern com munion. Their stand is fre quently expressed in terms of their church's need for theolog ical distinctiveness. Some observers believe, how ever, that the lingering con troversy over the merger has racial overtones since a union with the 3.2‐million‐members of the Northern denomination would ultimately lead to broad er participation by Negroes in Southern Presbyterian congre gations. All but about 7,000 of the Southern church's members are white and fewer than 50 of its 4,300 ministers are Negroes. The Northern and Southern church have been involved in merger negotiations since early last year. Both are a part of the Consultation on Church Union. In the last few months, the merger talks have prompted the formation of several parti san caucuses in the Southern church, raising for some the specter of schism. But there was little discus sion of that word during the General Assembly. Many com missioners and observers be lieve that those who oppose the merger of their church and its participation in the Consul tation on Church Union did not press their case in this meet ing, choosing rather to gather strength for a showdown later when the question reaches the decision stage. The conservative foes of merger were handed a quick defeat on the first day of the meeting when the Rev. Dr. Wil liam A Benfield, of Charleston, W. Va., was elected Moderator of the Assembly. Mr. Benfield is considered a liberal and has been active in negotiations with the Northern denomination and the consul ation on Church Union. Under his guidance, the rep resentatives approved a con current meeting of the General Assembly with that of the Northern church in Louisville, Ky., in 1974, and officially in vited six other communions to join the conversations between the two churches, an invitation the Northerners had offered earlier. Those invited to participate are the associate Reformed Presbyterian Church, the Cum berland Presbyterian Church, the Hungarian Reformed Church in America, the Sec I and Cumberland Presbyterian Church (a Negro denomina tion), the Reformed Church in America and the United Church of Christ. Among the more significant actions of the Assembly was its approval of a position state ment on abortion which said, that, on occasion, it may be morally justified by threats to the physical or mental health of the mother, potential physi cal or mental defects in the unborn child, conception by rape or incest, or the socio economic condition of the fam ily. On Vietnam, the Assembly approved a resolution which warned against both a lengthy American involvement in the war and a precipitate withdraw al of American troops. Confronted with the Black Manifesto, a demand for finan cial reparations for American Negroes, the church admitted it had been involved in racism but said its funds were insuf ficient to respond to the re quest. About a dozen representa tives objected to the service honoring Dr. King last Sunday evening and presented a reso lution that condemned the late civil rights leader as “a Com munist helper.” The resolution was rejected and ultimately ex punged from the record.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Protest Groups Force A.M.A. Into Closed Session in Chicago,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/22/archives/protest-groups-force-ama-into-closed-session-in-chicago-protest.html,"CHICAGO, June 21—The an nual convention of the Ameri can Medical Association opened in confusion today as protest groups of blacks, consumers and the poor forced the dele gates into a closed meeting guarded by private policemen.  An hour before the formal opening, protesters took con trol of a consumer forum sponsored by the association and adopted an “indictment” against the A.M.A. for what was described as its “fail ure to he responsive to the health needs of the nation.” A 20‐member delegation rep resenting blacks, Mexicans, consumers, welfare mothers, feminists and homosexuals failed in its attempts to present the indictment formally to the association's House of Dele gates. The 244‐member policy‐mak ing body had Wit left ?? ?? it had been scheduled to meet, and moved into a different hall, which was closely guarded by scores of security guards. It was the first time in mem ory that the association's House of Delegates had closed its meeting to guests and mem bers of the press. They were allowed to watch the opening session of the 119th annual con vention on closed‐circuit Tele vision in an adjoining room. Aside from pushing and shov ing in the crowds, the demon strations were orderly. By employing protective tac tics the A.M.A. successfully fended off a direct confronta tion with the protest groups and activist doctors, who, in the last two years, had at times caused turmoil in the Huse of Delegates. About 400 person had gath ered at the consumer forum when 100 protesters, who earlier staged a rally in Grant Park, marched into the room and commandeered the stage where 10 representatives of the medical association were seated. Officials of the association had previously agreed to let the views of the protesters be heard, but had not been willing to yield the forum to the demonstrators, which, in fact, they were forced to do. Slogan‐shouting activists and speakers who denounced the association dominated the con frontation. The doctors them selves joined in the applause for one speaker, Dr. George Tolbert, a black physician from Howard University in Washing ton, who pleaded for under standing between the an tagonists. Dr. Tolbert urged both sides to work together to better the health care of the poor. He is working with Howard Univer sity's health services program in Marks, Miss. The protesters included Mrs. Beulah Sanders of the National Welfare Rights Organization in New York and others who last month occupied the office of Robert H. Finch, the outgoing Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, and held it for seven hours. Protests have marked the A.M.A.'s conventions for the last eight years. In the last sev eral years, the association has issued statements that have been increasingly liberal regard ing health care for the poor and enrollment of members of minority groups in medical schools. But the activists contend that the association is not moving fast enough to implement sug gestions made by the organiza tion's own commitees. The ac tivists say that medical care is a right, not a privilege, and that consumers as well as doctors should have the right to de termine its quality and quantity. On some issues, units of the A.M.A. have favored positions that are reformist in nature, such as the abolition of abor tion laws. Last month, the board of trustees recommended that abortion be considered a matter between a woman and her physician, without legal constraints. The abortion issue is to be discussed by the House of Delegates as well as a proposal for a form of national health insurance called Medicredit, which includes a type of negative income tax to under write health care for poor families. Among other issues to be discussed in the next four days are the placing of restrictions on the admission of patients by doctors to institutions in which they have a financial interest; a dues increase, and a $10‐million public relations drive to improve the image of American medicine. Dr. Gerald D. Dorman of New York, president of the as sociation, said in his opening address today that the asso ciation was committed to finding better ways of providing more and better health care.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ABORTION REFORM DEBATED BY A.M.A.,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/23/archives/abortion-reform-debated-by-ama-catholics-oppose-move-for-repeal-of.html,"CHICAGO, June 22—Roman Caholic doctors fought today to have the American Medical Association sidetrack a recom mendation of its board of trust ees that would favor the repeal of all laws limiting abortions. An A.M.A. committee con sidering the abortion issue heard 52 witnesses testify, sometimes emotionally, that abortion was either murder of the unborn child or a social necessity. The policy‐making House of Delegates of the parent body Is expected to vote tomorrow on the so‐called abortion‐on demand, which has been en acted in three states, New York, Alaska and Hawaii. This allows abortion to be a decision made by a woman and her physician without legal intervention. Several speakers said that while A.M.A. actions were not legally binding, some state Legislatures considering abor tion reform measures were cer tain to be swayed by the actions of the nation's largest association of physicians. In 1967 the A.M.A. liberalized its official stand on abortion to allow abortions if the mental health of the mother was in danger, if the child would be born deformed, if the concep tion took place through rape or incest. Defeat, Then Support A move to liberalize that policy still further was over whelmingly defeated by the A.M.A. last year. But last month the board of trustees surprisingly supported it. Members of the National Federation of Catholic Physi cians Guilds led the fight against the proposed change, contending that “this departure may place the profession of medicine at the disposal of government in a manner inim ical to the proper functioning of the profession, as was the case in Nazi Germany.” “The killing of the living in side the womb will open the way to the execution of the living outside the womb,” said Dr. Gloria V. Heffernan of Wil mette, Ill. Dr. Heffernan, the mother of five, described abortion as the “manic simplistic solution of the New Left” to the social ills of the nation. She was the only woman to testify against the proposed change. Opposition Arguments In all 32 speakers voiced their opposition to radical changes in the abortion laws. It was contended that their re peal would lead to euthanasia as the next step, that preser vation of life was the sacred duty of medicine, that health services would be swamped by the demand that unlimited abortions would create, that it was a “cop out” from the so lution of social problems and that it was a surrender “to the temper tantrum genera tion.” Dr. Gregory White of Frank Park, Ill., said doctors were in danger of becoming the tools of the social planners.” He argued that even in a hos pital abortions were not as safe as many persons would have the public believe, and then asked, “What kind of blood bath would we be let ting the women of America in for?” Dr. Matthias H. Backer of St. Louis said the social require ments for abortion, such as poverty and hunger, “are dis appearing rapidly and we should not put a cheap price on human life.” One antireform doctor rose from the audience to argue that potential illegitimacy was not a valid reason for abortion. He yelled: “There are a lot of bastards in the United States who have made significant contributions to American society.” He was, amid laughter, ruled out of order. But Dr. Allen C. Barnes, the chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Johns Hopkins medical In stitutions, Baltimore where al most 200 abortions a month are being performed, said 62 per cent of these patients were found to be unmarried women under the age of 21. “Teen‐age illegitimacy is one of our worst diseases,” Dr. Barnes observed. Dr. Josephine Renshaw, a Washington obstetrician who is president of the American Med ical Women's Association, said: “Over and over again I have seen boy friends and husbands walking away from unwanted pregnancies, but women can't walk away.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two Key Backers of Abortion Reform in the Legislature Are Defeated Upstate,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/24/archives/two-key-backers-of-abortion-reform-in-the-legislature-are-defeated.html,"The two key figures in the politically explosive abortion reform struggle in the 1970 Legislature—one a Republican the other a Democrat—were defeated in party primary elec tions yesterday.  Republican Senator D. Clin ton Dominick of Newburgh, the Senate sponsor of the re form bill, and Democratic As semblyman George M. Michaels of Auburn were both defeated in elections in which the abor tion reform votes were deci sive. Senator Dominick, serving his 12th year in the Senate after four years in the lower house and generally considered a leader of the Republican party in Albany, was defeated by a political novice, Rich ard Schermerhorn, who ran a generally conservative‐oriented campaign. Specialist in Education Some politicians consider his defeat a general loss for Liber al Republicanism in Albany since Mr. Dominick led his par ty in liberal education legisla tion in his role as chairman of the Senate Education Commit tee. Mr. Michaels, who is confined to a hospital bed because of a recent auto accident, declined to speculate on the cause of his first defeat after 10 years in office. But John Rossi, the 33‐year‐ old Auburn lawyer who de feated Mr. Michaels to win the Democratic nomination, said “the way Michaels voted on the abortion bill” was his key to victory. The abortion bill apparently figured heavily in contests where it led to a primary chal lenge to supporters of the liberalization. In Buffalo, Arthur O. Eve, an incumbent Democratic Assem blyman, was attacked by lead ers of his own party for his abortion‐reform vote. Mr. Eve, facing a strong challenge from John A. Smith, said last night that the Assem bly minority whip, John B. Lis, also from Buffalo, had. “written a letter against me today obvi ously aimed at the Catholics in my community pointing out I voted for the abortion reform bill.” Mr. Eve said he would con front Democratic party offi cials in Albany today with the letter and “win, lose or draw they are going to have to ex plain this use of the party officials against another Demo crat.” Mr. Eve defeated Mr. Smith by 6,139 to 4,498. Senator William E. Adams was renominated in the Buf falo suburb of Kenmore. The Republican incumbent was ac quitted last April on charges of perjury and obstruction of jus tice in an investigation of the state's medicaid program. Most Incumbents Safe As returns trickled in late last night only a few incum bents were facing serious threats. Political observers sug gested that only emotional is sues such as the abortion vote would make a difference in the little‐publicized legislative pri maries. Mr. Michaels seemed to typi fy such an upset. A highly pop ular vote‐getter in his upstate district, the Assemblyman prob ably would not have had op position except for his abortion vote. Mr. Rossi had said earlier that he would not seek the seat as long as Mr. Michaels held it. However, 10 days after his dramatic vote in favor of abor tion reform on April 9, the Democratic leaders in Cayuga County held a convention and withdrew an earlier endorse ment of Mr. Michaels. In a dis trict with a heavy concentra tion of Roman Catholics, the vote was essentially political suicide. “I realize,” Mr. Michaels said the day of the deciding vote, “that I am terminating my political carer.” The prediction, despite last night's defeat, may he prema ture. According to his campaign manager, Mr. Michaels has the Liberal party's endorsement and is still considering taking on all corners in the November election. Among the upstate incum bents who won renomination were Senator William T. Smith of Elmira and Assemblyman Charles D. Henderson of Hornell. Both men are Repub licans. Albert J. Hausheck, a Demo cratic Assemblyman from Buf falo who was accused by his party leaders of seeking “politi cal plums” when he voted for a Republican‐sponsored sales tax last year, ran for renomi nation as both a Democrat and a Republican. Mr. Hausbeck was renominated on the Repub lican line but incomplete re turns indicated that he had lost on the Democratic line. In the 73d Assembly District In Manhattan Edward H. Leh ner defented John J. Walsh, a Democrat who has been in the Assembly since 1959.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Six Incumbents in State Assembly Are Defeated,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/25/archives/six-incumbents-in-state-assembly-are-defeated.html,"Six of the 150 members of the State Assembly went to defeat Tuesday in the rash of primaries for the Legislature across the state that involved the four major parties. In all, there were 75 Assem bly contests, 52 within Demo cratic ranks, 18 among Repub licans, four within the Conserv ative party and one involving Liberals. Five of the six incumbent los ers were Democrats and one a Republican. One incumbent Democrat, a loser in his own primary, survived a Republi can contest after having been designed by the opposing party and then running into a prim ary fight there as well. The epidemic of primary con tests also hit the State Senate, but the final outcome there was not as well defined because of the slowness of the unofficial count upstate, where a score of counties used paper ballots. The Six Who Lost Incumbents who went to de feat were Lawrence P. Murphy of the Brooklyn 42d district, beaten by Brian Sharoff in a four‐way race; John J. Walsh who bowed to Edward H. Leh ner in the Manhattan 73d; Ed ward A. Stevenson, loser to Louis Nine in the Bronx 78th and Richard Cerosky, a Repub lican, defeated by J. Edward Leenan in the Westchester 92d. Also George M. Michaels, whose vote switch resulted in passage of the abortion bill, loser to John Rossi in the up state 122d; and Albert J. Haus beck who bowed to Raymond Lewandowski in the Erie County 144th in a four‐way race. It was Mr. Hausbeck, one of two Democrats voting for state tax increases in 1969, who won in the Republican primary in the 144th while he tried un successfully to win renomina tion as a Democrat. In the Bronx, Paul A. Fino Jr., son of the State Supreme Court justice and formerly Representative and Bronx Re publican leader, won in both the Republican and Conserva tive party primaries. In one of the Senate upsets, D. Clinton Dominick of New burgh, Republican incumbent, lost, as did Mr. Michaels in the Assembly, in the face of op position aroused by his support of the liberalized abortion law. The loss to Richard E. Scher merhorn of Cornwall was by 132 votes—6,680 to 6,548. Lieutenant (j.g.) Rolland E. Kidder, now on duty with the Navy in Vietnam, won in the upstate 10th Assembly district, embracing Jamestown, over John Palillo Sr. and Harry Kra mer, a former All‐American basketball player at New York University and member of the New York Knicks, took the As sembly race in the Schenectady 105th.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Aborting Political Careers,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/26/archives/aborting-political-careers.html,"Abortion law reform, long overdue and finally en acted at the last session of the State Legislature, emerged as an ugly and divisive campaign issue in some primary contests. Roman Catholics as well as non‐Catholics must have been offended at the viciousness of some of the cam paign literature attacking members who voted for change. For example, Brooklyn Assemblyman Chester John Straub, himself a Catholic and an outstanding legistator was accused in leaflets of “wholesale murder.” These leaflets urged all “parishioners and Catho lics” to react to what was called “a slap in the face for Catholicism.” Assemblyman Straub won his race handily, as did Manhattan Assemblyman William F. Passannante and Bronx Assemblyman Alexander Chananau. Others, however, lost. Democrats in Auburn rejected Assem blyman George M. Michaels, who cast the deciding vote for reform in his chamber; Republicans in New burgh rejected State Senator D. Clinton Dominick, a sponsor of abortion reform and a widely respected, valuable leader on other key issues as well. Every issue considered by the Legislature deserves to become a campaign issue. Abortion reform, clearly, is in that class. Yet it is unreasonable to allow that issue to overshadow all others. Worse still, it is un healthy for any sect, religion or group to seek a spe cial vengeance at the polls, for the result of this activity can be political balkanization. The awareness of legislators from heavily Catholic districts that they were risking their political lives by voting for abortion repeal underscores the courage they showed. We believe they contributed to the enlightenment of government.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Board Votes Clinics' Use,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/26/archives/board-votes-clinics-use-health-board-expands-abortion-plan.html,"The city's Board of Health voted yesterday to permit abor tions in clinics as well as in hospitals, but only if stringent standards are met. The unanimous decision of the five‐member board allows greater latitude than the abor tion “guidelines” announced May 21 by the Health Ser vices Administration. Those guidelines, formulated by an advisory committee on obste trics and gynecology, called for allowing abortions to be per formed only in hospitals. Under the new abortion Jaw, the most permissive in the country, which takes effect net Wednesday, any woman, with the concurrence of her physician, may obtain an abor tion up to the 24th week of pregnancy. When the city guidelines were made public in May, the Health Commissioner, Mary] C. McLaughlin, said she ex pected the “in‐hospitals‐only” recommendation to be incor porated into the city's Health Code, giving it the force of law. Board Member Explains Since then, the Board of Health has met several times to discuss the subject, includ ing several sessions with in terested citizens' groups and the chiefs of obstetrics and gynecology of major hospitals here. Following yesterday's meet ing, Dr. Walsh McDermott, one of the board members, said, “We made every effort to insure that unnecessary burdens were not put in the way of women.” Some groups had urged the board to adopt no regulations at all. They had also objected to the earlier guidelines. Al though the guidelines would have no legal effect, they argue they could serve to inhibit phy sicians. In a malpractice suit, it Could be charged, the critics contended, that a doctor had not followed accepted medical practices. The board decided, however, that it must promulgate some regulations to insure the safety of patients. The proposed regu lations announced yesterday cannot be made part of the Health Code until 20 days after they are published in The City Record, which will probably be done on Monday. In the mean time, the board plans to call public hearings for mid‐July. Thus, the city will have no legal restrictions on abortions for several weeks after the new law takes effect. If the proposed regulations are adopted in their present form, abortions in New York City could be performed at the following facilities: ¶In a hospital—on an out patient basis up to the 12th week of pregnancy, on an in patient basis after 12 weeks. ¶In a clinic affiliated with a hospital, provided the traveling time from clinic to hospital is no more than 10 minutes, the maximum time allowable to transfer a patient in the event of an emergency, the board agreed. ¶In an independent clinic, if it has a blood bank, a labora tory equipped to perform nec essary tests, a skilled medical staff, proper anesthetic equip ment and an operating room equipped for abdominal sur gery. A physician's private office would qualify under the third category if it contained all the required equipment and per sonnel. Not many doctors are expected to so equip and staff their offices. The proposed regulations would also require that coun seling in family planning and birth control be provided to each patient. No residency requirements are included in the proposal, but Dr. McLaughlin said the board would urge that city resi dents be given priority over out‐of‐towners.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Social Reasons Accepted,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/26/archives/social-reasons-accepted-abortion-rules-relaxed-by-ama.html,"CHICAGO, June 25 — The American Medical Association voted for the first time in its 123‐year history today to al low doctors to perform abor tions for social and economic reasons, as well as medical. After a bitter controversy at the association's annual con vention, the A.M.A.'s House of Delegates voted 103 to 73 to consider the performing of abortions ethical if the follow ing conditions are met: ¶That the doctor be properly licensed to practice medicine. ¶That the operation he per formed in a hospital accredited by various public health or ganizations. ¶That two other physicians be called in for consultation. Today's stand, which was re garded as a surprising turnabout by many physicians here, is not quite so liberal as the newly enacted abortion laws in New York, Hawaii, and Alas ka. The New York law, for example, does not require the last two conditions. But the new position has far fewer legal qualifications than laws in the 47 other states and it is bound to affect abortion reform campaigns in them. The Judicial Council of the A.M.A., as a matter of informa tion, told the organization to day that the legal jurisdiction of the locality in which the physician practiced superseded the ethic of the medical group. After the vote, Dr. Gino Pa pola of Upper Darby, Pa., the president of the 6,000‐member National Federation of Catholic Physicians Guild, said he in tended to resign from the A.M.A. and he urged the na tion's other 35,000 Catholic doctors to do the same. “In effect, the A.M.A. has made it ethical for doctors to become paid executioners,” Dr. Papola said in a telephone in terview. “I certainly don't want to be a doctor in the A.M.A. under these circumstances.” However, the resolution adopted by the House of Dele gates, which sets policy for the group, specifically states that a doctor cannot be compelled to perform an abortion if it “vio lated his is medical judg ment” or s “yiolative of per sonally held moral principles.” Today's action is not expect ed to affect Roman Catholic hospitals, which contain nearly one‐third of the nation's gener al hospital beds, since the reso lution also states that hospitals do not have to perform abor tions if their directors do not want them to. Few abortions, if any, are performed in Catholic institutions. For 120 years the A.M.A. considered abortions unethical, stating in 1871, for example, “that it to be the duty of every physician in the United States to resort to every honorable and legal means in his power to rid society of this practice.” Over the years, however, some respected physicians would perform abortions if they be lieved that the pregnancy was a threat to the health of the mother. Three years ago the House of Delegates voted to consider the performing of an abortion ethical if there were a threat to the mother's physical or mental health, a threat that the child might be born deformed, or if conception had taken place under criminal conditions such as rape or incest. A dozen states and the Dis trict of Columbia subsequently altered their abortion laws. This fall the Supreme Court is to take under consideration the issue of whether a law that restricts abortion is a violation of a woman's constitutional rights. The A.M.A.'s shift on abor tion was prompted by a report issued last month by the association's 15‐man Board of Trus tees that “recommends that the House of Delegates establish a policy on abortion that would permit the decision to interrupt pregnancy to be made by the woman and her physician.” The trustees said they were worried that the new state laws might force doctors prac ticing in those states that have liberalized their abortion laws into what might be construed as an unethical position. A special A.M.A. committee on Monday heard 52 witnesses testify on the Board of Trus tees' recommendation with many Catholic physicians urg ing that it not be adopted. The Catholic policy on abortion is that the practice is immoral except when medical treatment, such as radiation for cancer, might kill the fetus. Dr. Wesley W. Hall of Reno was voted president‐elect of the A.M.A. Dr. Hall, a member of the Board of Trustees, will succeed. Dr. Walter C. Born meier when his term expires at the 1971 convention. Dr. H. Thomas McGuire of New Castle, Del., was elected vice president.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Blue Cross Here to Cover Single Women's Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/27/archives/blue-cross-here-to-cover-single-womens-abortions-blue-cross-tells.html,"Blue Cross of Greater New York has decided to extend its coverage for abortions per formed in hospitals to include single women and dependent children after the state's new abortion law takes effect Wednesday.  Blue Cross contracts are now worded to offer hospital bene fits only to married women with family contracts who have legal abortions. The change in policy, an nounced yesterday, was ap proved by the organization's board of directors on Wednes day. It will immediately affect about half of Blue Cross con tracts in the city and 12 sur rounding counties. A similar policy change, which would provide benefits toward doctor bills for abor tions done in hospitals; will come before the board of Greater New York's Blue Shield organization on June 30. A spokesman for Blue Cross said approval by the Blue Shield board was expected. Neither organization, how ever, will cover abortions per formed in specially equipped clinics or in hospital‐affiliated clinics, as allowed under the new guidelines issued Thursday by the City Board of Health. In another development yes terday, the city's Health and Hospital Corporation an nounced that city hospitals would perform abortions on minors without parental con sent if the patient were mar ried, emancipated or at least 17 years old. An emancipated minor is self‐supporting or living away from home under such circumstances that she makes most of her own deci sions. The hospitals will make ex ception to their requirement of parental consent for all other minors if, in the physician's opinion, seeking parental con sent would endanger the child's physical or mental health. Of the other major health plans in New York, the Health Insurance Plan of New York (HIP) has said it will com pletely cover physicians' serv ices for all abortions performed in hospitals by HIP obstetri cians, regardless or whether the woman is married or single or a dependent child. Dr. LeRoy Bates, vice presi dent for medical affairs at HIP, said that “at the moment, hospi tal ‐ affiliated clinics are not in cluded in our program.” “We will have to consider individual hospitals' proposals to use clinics as they come up,” he said. The Group Health Insurance Plan, however, has not yet de cided to extend its abortion coverage beyond the present allowance to married women With family plans. “We're still discussing things,” a spokesman said. “We're wait ing, among other things, to see how many women will be af fected and where abortions will be performed.” Whether major‐medical in surance plans will provide bene fits for abortions will depend largely upon the individual plans. In general, a spokesman for one insurance company of fering major‐medical policies said, if the “plan provides for maternity benefits, it most like ly will also Provide benefits for abortions. Most current plans with ma ternity benefits require that the woman be married and insured under the same, policy with her husband. However, a spokesman for the Prudential Insurance Com pany said it expected to offer a new group: plan for businesses within the month that would provide both maternity and abortion coverage to all wom en employes, married or single. And the Equitable Life Insur ance Company, said it expected to decide within a week on a new, more liberal policy regard ing abortion coverage. Under the new policy of Greater New York's Blue Cross, which is known as the Associ ated Hospital Service of New York, abortion benefits will be the same as Maternity bene fits—from $80 to $150, depend ing on the type of contract— and will cover abortions per formed either on an inpatient or outpatient basis. The Blue Shield benefits would range from $50 to $100, depending on the contract. All women currently covered by a “community‐rated” group policy will automatically have abortion benefits extended to them, without any rate, increase “at this time,” the Blue Cross spokesman said. There is no limitation on the number of abortions performed within year. However, women covered by “experience‐rated” group con tracts — representing half of those insured under Blue Cross —would be covered for abor tions only if their groups de cided to add this benefit to the contracts. Coverage would be retroactive to July 1, when, the state's new law takes effect. Such an addition would raise the group's premiums, depend ing upon how many women in the “group “undergo abortions within a year and how much the group wants to pay toward them. Those insured under individ ual contract would not receive abortion benefits, the spokes man said, unless these custom ers had originally received their contracts through a group.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Syrians said Syrian tanks had pushed into Israeli‐held territory and that 11 Israeli jets had been shot down. Israel admitted losing one plane. [Page 1, Column 8.] Soviet officials, in discussions with Amer ican officials in Washington, were said to have expressed renewed interest in a Middle East settlement. The Russian moves, details of which were not known, were seen as possible break in the Soviet‐American im passe that has existed since December. [1:7.] Bernadette Devlin, a Roman Catholic civil rights leader and a Member of Parliament, began a six‐month prison sentence for riot ous behavior during the religious strife in Northern Ireland last summer. [1:5–7.] The Senate by a vote of 73 to 0 added a clause affirming the war‐making powers of Congress to a proposed amendment to limit future United States military activi ties in Cambodia. The clause, proposed by Senator Jacob K. Javits, was meant to neu tralize one already added to the Cooper Church amendment reaffirming the Presi dent's power as Commander in Chief. [4:3.6.] In a vote that confirmed the victory of conservatives in the Communist leadership of Czechoslovakia, the Central Committee expelled Alexander Dubcek, the former lib eral leader, from party membership. [2:3–5.] National Jerris Leonard, director of the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Departnient, said that Southern school districts with dual systems that do not present acceptable desegrega tion plans by next week would be taken into court. About 50 districts, which have had freedom‐of‐choice plans, are affected. [1:2–3.] Responding to petitions filed by several legal organizations and a critical report by a Federal grand jury, the chief judge of the Cook County Criminal Court in Chicago ap pointed a special prosecutor to empanel special grand jury and investigate the slay ing of two Black Panthers by the police in a raid last December. [1:2–3.] Union truck drivers in the Chicago area overwhelmingly rejected a contract settle ment that would have given them raises of $1.65 an hour over 45 months.

(15:1–5.] Metropolitan A revision of the city's rent control law raising most rents Aug. 1 by 8 to 15 per cent was reported close to passage by the City Council. About 1.3 million families live in rent‐controlled apartments in the city. The revision would eventually tie rents to landlords' costs and profits. [1:1.] New Jersey forbade insurance companies from canceling homeowner and automobile insurance policies and other lines of per sonal coverage for the next 90 days. The action was taken after residents of the state received a flood of policy cancellations. The state also announced plans to give its anti trust regulation power over interstate insur ers to the Federal Government. [1:4.] Blue Cross of Greater New York said would cover abortion operations performed in hospitals in the state after July, 1 for all subscribers in its “community‐rated” group, including unmarried women. The Blue Shield organization is expected to vote to do the same next week. [1:5–6.] James T. Callaghan, a former member of the Newark City Council who is on trial with. Mayor Hugh T.

"After July 1, an abortion should be as simple to have as a tonsillectomy, but —",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/28/archives/after-july-1-an-abortion-should-be-as-simple-to-have-as-a.html,"IT all looked so simple on April 10, the day the New York State Legislature finally amended the state's penal law to give New York the most liberal abortion statute in the United States. The Legislature's language was sparse and seemed scarcely open to misinterpretation. “An abortional act is justifiable when committed upon a female with her consent by a duly licensed phy sician acting, (a) under a reasonable belief that such act is necessary to preserve her life, or (b) within 24 weeks from the commencement of her pregnancy. . . . The act shall take effect July 1970.” July 1 is almost here, and what looked so simple 11 weeks ago has turned out to be a source of bureaucratic wrangling, dispute and even bitter ness within the medical community, and wide spread confusion on the part of the general public. There is no one in the state who can say pre cisely what July 1 will bring; it is quite possible that no one will really know what July 1 brought until the dust settles in a month or so and the statisticians and planners can go to work. Many hospitals have been reluctant to make detailed plans without knowing exactly how many women will want abortions. Without plans, it is impossible to estimate how many abortions can be handled. Juggling these two unknowns, many of those re sponsible for implementing the new law feel as they have been chasing their tails these last two and a half months, fearing all the while that, with abortions, the alternative to planning may be chaos. The language of the new law, apparently so straightforward, meant different things to differ ent people. To those who had been in the fore front of the reform fight, the new law seemed promise, at least, quick, low‐cost abortions on re quest for women everywhere. After all, the law contained no residency requirement and nothing to prohibit doctors from performing abortions in their offices or in clinics—thus bypassing the high cost of hospital care. At last, it seemed, abortion had been placed where it belonged—in the legal category of, perhaps, a tonsillectomy, with no more red tape, committees, humiliation or exploi tation. But to those who suddenly found themselves faced with administering the new law, the vision it evoked was quite the opposite. They saw num bers. New York was about to become the only state in the country to liberalize its abortion law with out adding a residency requirement. Last year, there were an estimated 1.2 million abortions performed in the United States. All but 30,000 or 40,000 of them were illegal. In addition, an esti mated 800,000 women carried their pregnancies to term only because they could not get legal abortions and could not bring themselves to go to an illegal abortionist. Thus there is a potential national demand for abortions of about two mil lion a year. With New York the only place for most of these women to go, what would happen if they all came here? Indeed, what would happen to the esti mated 50,000 to 100,000 New York City women alone who would seek abortions? The doctors and planners—including those who had fought for abortion reform—who reacted these statistics with horror also knew another sta tistic. Hospitals in New York City have 3,160 obstetrical beds and last year performed all of 850 therapeutic abortions. How could the system get ready to transform itself so drastically? If it failed, would the city see a proliferation of abortion mills, technically legal but medically unsound? Would profiteering, unscrupulous practitioners prey on desperation as they always had? What was to become of the practice of medicine in New York? The old, rigid law had certainly hurt many people. Would the new law injure countless more by holding out a promise of what could not be safely delivered? Clearly, if getting the new law passed had been a difficult task, arranging for its implementation was going to be monumental. No one doubted that the new law would make abortions more available than ever before. The question was not whether to move, but how quickly and in what direction. Most people who had ever thought about it acknowledged that abortion repeal was destined to come, some day. Suddenly, that day was less than three months away. THE controversy focused on two issues: a resi dency requirement and where abortions were to be performed. Both became questions of more than merely handling the numbers; they involved the social and medical issues at the heart of the imple mentation problem. If abortion were to be made available to the poor, the women who had suffered most at the hands of illegal abortionists, then obviously the operation would have to be available in places where costs could be kept low—doctors offices and clinics. To restrict the operation to hospitals would be to keep abortion largely as a privilege of the rich; to restrict it to New Yorkers would be to make it the privilege of the New York rich. On the other hand, did abortion in offices and clinics constitute good medicine? And, if there were to be compromises, where should they be made, at the expense of large numbers or at the expense of absolute medical standards? That question raised another. There has been, and continues to be, vigorous disagreement about what those medical standards are, and with good reason. The medical profession as a whole has surprisingly little experience with abortion. Because for 140 years abortion in New York has been part of the penal law, it never entered the sphere of medical discretion. The medical profession never had a chance to reach a consensus on “standard medical practice” regarding abortion; until quite recently, and then only in a relatively few big‐city hospitals, an abortion which was not clearly indicated to save the mother's life was simply not performed. The operation was not done in large enough num bers for doctors to develop a widely shared body of knowledge. The average New York City gyne cologist, with operating privileges at an average voluntary hospital, probably has been performing about one abortion a year, if that many. In upstate areas, the figure is probably even lower. Doctors who did perform medically sound, although il legal, abortions in their offices did not publish papers or share their experience with their law ‐ abiding colleagues. There are no precise figures, of course, but those doctors represented only a small per centage of the whole. Even the most outspokenly liberal gynecologists, when abortion committees at their hospitals refused to approve the opera tion for their patients, had to content themselves with re ferring the patients to Eng land or Japan or, in even more rare cases, to one of the better‐known out‐of‐state abortionists. To understand the medical aspects of the controversy, it is worthwhile to examine the nature of the abortion opera tion. There are currently four medically accepted abortion procedures in use in this country. The most common is dila tion and curettage. The open ing of the cervix, or lower portion of the uterus, is dilat ed with a series of instruments in graduated sizes to allow the insertion of a curette, or scraping instrument, into the uterus. The pregnancy is then scraped from the uterine wall. A “D‐and‐C,” as the proce dure is usually called, is ad vised only during the first 10 or 12 weeks of pregnancy. It can be done under a local anesthetic, which is injected alongside the cervix. However, in women who have never given birth, the opening to the cervix is only about the diam eter of a broom straw. The dilation procedure then can be quite difficult and time‐con suming, and general anesthe sia is usually preferred. Another method for abortion in early pregnancy is uterine aspiration, usually called suc tion. The cervix is dilated as in a D‐and‐C, and then the uterus is evacuated by means of a vacuum suction machine. This method, which was intro duced from Japan to Europe and then into the United States about 12 years ago, is neater, quicker and generally considered safer than a D‐and‐C, since there is less chance of perforating the uter us. Like a D‐and‐C, suction can be performed under local anesthesia on a woman who has previously had children. Both can be performed on an out‐patient basis, allowing sev eral hours for recovery and to watch for possible complica tions. For pregnancies up to 20 weeks — the latest most doc tors will recommend abortion —one method is a hystero tomy, actually a Caesarian operation in which the uterus is opened from above and the fetus removed. A hysterotomy is major surgery and requires at least several days in the hospital. A newer method called “salting out” has recently been gaining favor in some of the larger hospitals. In this proce dure, a hypodermic needle is inserted through the abdomen and uterine wall into the am niotic sac, which contains the amniotic fluid and the fetus. About 200 cc. of amniotic fluid are removed, and are re placed by no more than that amount of a 20 per cent saline solution. The saline solution kills the fetus and induces labor. Labor begins from 12 to 36 hours after the injection, and the woman expels the fetus in a normal delivery. Salting out can be done under local anesthesia; in some cases, women have been able to go home and return to the hos after labor has begun. NONE of these procedures is especially formidable, as operations go. On the other hand, they are operations, and none are without possible dan ger and discomfort. “The pub lic has gotten the idea that an abortion can be done in a few minutes,” says Dr. Sherwin A. Kaufman, a practicing gyne cologist who is also medical director for Planned Parent hood of New York City. “Un der some ideal conditions, it can be. But changing the law doesn't change the nature of the procedure. It is still a medical procedure that de serves to be treated with the greatest respect.” An ideal abortion, Dr. Kauf man said, is one that would be performed on a woman less than 10 weeks pregnant who had already had one or more babies. As either factor changes, the chance of compli cations is likely to increase. Doctors fear that many wo men who ordinarily would have sought illegal abortions or would have prepared to have their babies have been waiting until July 1 to ask for their abortions, although by then they will be more than 12 weeks pregnant. To the problem of large numbers will be added a disproportionately high number of complicated abortions. Ironically, the leading med ical spokesman for the con servative approach to both a residency requirement—impos ing one—and out ‐ of ‐ hospital abortions—forbidding them— is Dr. Robert E. Hall, president of the Association for the Study of Abortion and an as sociate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia University. His role is ironic because he has been in the forefront of the abortion‐repeal movement for years. Only last winter, he was a plaintiff in a Federal Court suit which sought to have New York's abortion law declared unconstitutional. (The suit was dropped when, a week before the case was to be heard, the new law was passed.) In the months since then, in the eyes of some of his associates, Dr. Hall has turned from a hero into some thing of a goat. The trans formation amuses him. “I've never seen articulate, intelli gent people flip like they did when I started talking about this,” he says. Dr. Hall bases his views on the limited abortion experi ence of most doctors here and on his conviction that New York's handling of its abortion law will be a crucial test for the course of abortion reform in the rest of the country. He has studied abortion sta tistics for several years and is the editor of a two‐volume study, “Abortion in a Chang ing World.” “We don't know the precise demand, but we can certainly guess the ball park,” he says. New York women, he estimates, will seek about 50,000 abortions a year. Without a residency re quirement, about 500,000 wo men would come to New York, almost all of them to New York City. IN 1968, only 68 of the city's 136 hospitals performed any abortions at all. To meet a demand of 50,000, each of those hospitals would have to do about 14 abortions a week, a number Dr. Hall calls “feas ible.” With half a million abortions, each hospital would have to do about 20 a day— feasible in time, but “there is almost no hospital presently able to do that,” he says. “To cope with even 50,000 abortions, 80 to 90 per cent of them will have to be done on an out‐patient basis, using suc tion and minimal anesthesia. There isn't one doctor in the state of New York who has ever done a legal abortion un der those three conditions out‐patient, local anesthesia and suction. To do 50,000 with these strange new techniques will be trouble enough in a hospital. But let the floodgates open, let in 500,000, and you will have to have independent clinics to accommodate them. Then you will have deaths, profiteering, gruesome stories on the front pages of the papers. “Next January, the Legisla ture will meet again and say, ‘See what a mess they've made of the abortion law,’ and they'll rescind it. The other 49 states, looking at the New York experience, will see us screwing it up and will stay away from abortion repeal. I'm even naive enough to be lieve that Supreme Court Jus tices read the papers, and that they will wonder why they should legalize abortion repeal for the whole country if this is the way we behave in New York. “To say that a residency requirement and hospital re strictions will keep abortion underground, will keep abor tions away from poor women, is one thing—but to what end? For the larger goal—to en hance the chance of nation wide repeal forever. “I've fought for repeal for seven years, and I don't want to see it jeopardized by our experience here. All we need is breathing time, a grace pe riod to start doing abortions under the best possible condi tions. Then, possibly in a year, when we see where we are going, when other states start   relaxing their laws and easing the demand on New York, then we can safely open up.” Dr. Hall's pessimistic prem ise is not universally shared. The National Association for Repeal of Abortion Laws and other groups have been refer ring thousands of women to technically illegal but medi cally competent abortionists. Most of the operations have been D‐and‐C's performed in the doctor's office without complications. These groups point out that it is the butchers — unqualified people who take no sanitary precau tions — who have given in office abortions a bad name. “New York women, Dr. Hall estimates will seek about 50.000 abortions a year. Without a residency requirement, about 500,000 women would come to New York almost all of them to New York City.” “A qualified person can safely perform an abortion anywhere,” said Dr. Bernard Nathanson, chief of gynecol ogy at the Hospital for Joint Diseases (a general hospital, despite its name). On July 1, Dr. Nathanson will preside at a day‐long training session on the techniques of out‐of hospital abortions, sponsored by the National Association for Repeal of Abortion Laws. More than 15,000 doctors have been invited, and the first 350 to accept will be accommo dated in the main auditorium at New York University Med ical Center. A panel of three doctors will talk about their experiences in performing abortions in their offices. Dr. Nathanson will demonstrate equipment and discuss its use. IT was against this back ground of medical controversy and uncertainty that, during a two‐week period in May, three agencies issued three sets of guidelines covering implemen tation of the new law. The first set came on May 12 from the Public Health Council, an arm of the New York State Department of Health. They recommended that abortions after the 12th week of pregnancy be per formed on an in‐patient basis only, and that all abortions, regardless of whether the pa tient remains overnight, be performed in a hospital, a hospital‐run clinic or “a suit ably staffed and equipped facility having a hospital affiliation agreement accept able to the State Hospital Council.” On May 21, the Health Serv ices Administration of New York City issued its guide lines. They were based on the recommendations of the Health Department's 19‐member Ad visory Committee on Obstet rics and Gynecology, a per manent group composed of medical professors and chiefs of service at large hospitals. Dr. Robert Hall is a member. The chairman is Dr. Saul Gus berg, chief of obstetrics at Mount Sinai Hospital. The city guidelines followed those of the state in allowing out‐patient abortions up to 12 weeks of pregnancy. They de parted from the state guide lines in restricting abortions to “hospital premises” only— no clinics. The following week, the Medical Society of the State of New York issued the third set of guidelines. They limited abortion to the 20th week of pregnancy, not the 24th as in the law, since “after the 20th week of gestation, the process cannot be classified as an abortion and constitutes an actual birth process.” In other words, it is possible that fetus delivered after 20 weeks could survive. Like the others, the society's guidelines limited out‐patient abortions to the period before the 12th week of pregnancy. In red ink and capital letters, the “hot line” newsletter, which presented the guidelines to the society's members, con tained this sentence: “The Medical Society of the State of New York would like to caution all physicians that an abortion performed after the 12th week of gestation is fraught with tremendous dan ger.” (It is interesting to note that the medical society counts the weeks of pregnancy start ing with the first day of a woman's last menstrual period, although presumably concep tion did not take place until two weeks later. Calculated this way, a woman in her 20th week of pregnancy is carry ing an 18‐week‐old fetus.) The medical society's guide lines followed those of the state rather than the city in permitting abortions to be per formed in free‐standing clinics with back‐up hospital agree ments, as well as in hospitals and hospital‐run clinics. SINCE none of the guide lines supplant the state law or have the effect of law at all, there has been confusion about exactly what they mean. The city's guidelines will have the effect of establishing policy for the 18 municipal hospitals which the city administers. But the city exerts no direct control over the majority of hospitals within its borders— 82 voluntary hospitals (i. e., privately owned, nonprofit making), and 36 proprietary (profit‐making) hospitals. To gether, the two private cate gories account for nearly two‐ thirds of the city's total hos pital beds and handle about four‐fifths of the obstetrical cases. Unless the city incorporates any of the guidelines into its 613‐page health code (a rather lengthy process which requires a public hearing), the guide lines technically have the ef fect, for private hospitals, of recommendations only. What the sets of guidelines do provide, in a cumulative way, is a definition of “stand ard medical practice” as ap plied to abortion. Standard medical practice is a bland phrase that carries consider able weight in the profession as a guide to doctors in their own practices in a general sense and as a recourse against a malpractice charge under more drastic conditions. Faced with a malpractice suit, one of a doctor's best possible defenses is that he acted in accordance with standard med ical practice. It is clear that a doctor who performs an abortion in his office after July 1, although it is perfectly legal for him to do so, will be acting against standard medical practice, at least as that definition seems to be emerging. If nothing went wrong with the abortion, probably nothing would “hap pen” to the doctor. If some thing did go wrong, he would be in a difficult position. The county and state medical so cieties have considerable pow er to police their own houses. The county societies can cen sor, suspend or expel members who are found in violation of medical ethics. Such action could prevent a doctor from being able to get malpractice insurance or staff privileges at accredited hospitals. An analogy could be drawn to the question of performing a tonsillectomy in a doctor's office. Although in the past tonsillectomies were often done in offices, the operation is regarded today as a hospital procedure. A doctor who en countered complications while performing a tonsillectomy in his office would have little defense against a malpractice suit, even though he was not in violation of any law. So, office abortions are not likely to become popular in medical circles. Because of the disparity between the state and city guidelines, the clinic situation is not so clear. Planned Parenthood and other groups have talked about opening clinics, but no one is expected to move until well after July 1, when the demand and supply picture becomes clearer. Only the city's guidelines talked about a residency re quirement. Patients at the mu nicipal hospitals are already required to be city residents, and no change will be made for abortion. The private hos pitals are urged to give “pri ority” to city residents. THE radicals in the abortion movement have not suppressed their outrage at the net of guidelines surrounding the law. “Hospitals will be doling out abortions like a privilege in stead of a right,” Dr. Nathan son said. “Doctors are getting dust thrown in their eyes by technicians and professors acting as experts. These men don't know what's happening with patients. They don't have to listen to some girl's sob story and tell her, Sorry, my dear, there's no bed for you, and send her running off to an illegal abortionist only to have to patch up her infected abortion a week later. There's going to be a terrible public outcry over this that will force the entire medical establish ment to open up.” “What right has anybody to tell the Legislature of the State of New York, responding to the will of the people, what to do? “asked Lawrence Lader, a well‐known abortion cru sader and chairman of the ex ecutive committee of the Na tional Association for Repeal of Abortion Laws. “It's be yond belief. It's the most crass and absurd thing I've ever heard. What do you pass a law for if a few medical‐hier archy bigwigs are going to make it 50 or 60 per cent in effective? It's absurd that the medical societies that fought the bill in the first place, and were defeated, are still calling the tune. “There have always been conservatives in any move ment who say to go slow,” Lader continued. “But we've proved that we can take a gamble. We made the abor tion‐repeal movement by forg ing ahead and knocking heads together. It's absurd to take the attitude that because we might make a mistake we have to go slow. We're tre mendous optimists. In a year or two there will be more states with abortion repeal and we won't need the re strictions we put in today. It's shortsighted. At least let's stay philosophically humane. The conservative approach has no place here. You have to do what F.D.R. did in the Depression, attack the prob lem in a sweeping way, not inch inch.” DESPITE their differences, most doctors do agree on a few aspects of the new law. One is that implementation requires a concerted effort at public education to inform women about the need for early pregnancy tests, the need for early rather than late abortion if that is the decision they make and the existence of some drawbacks to abortion with which most women are not familiar. Since April, queries have poured into doctors' offices and hospitals from women seeking information. The New York County Medical Society received so many calls, both from the public and from doctors and out‐of‐state medi cal societies, that it sent a questionnaire to its member gynecologists and obstetri cians asking them if they wanted to be listed on a spe cial referral list for abortions. Some of the inquiries have indicated a real lack of knowl edge about abortion, and this has concerned doctors as much the sheer numbers. “I'm very much concerned that the public not get the Idea that abortion is a substi tute for contraception,” Dr. Kaufman said. “The two are simply not in the same league. We're talking about a surgical procedure vs. a preventive service.” Even under the best of cir cumstances, abortion carries certain risks for those women who later plan to have chil dren. Dr. Kaufman specializes in the treatment of infertility, and he has observed that the trauma to the cervix and uterus of repeated abortion leads to an increased chance of miscarriage in the second trimester of pregnancy, pre mature birth and about twice the incidence of complioa tions in labor. This is espe cially true if a woman has an abortion before she has ever given birth. In addition, a slight, often undetectable infection can set up a low‐grade inflammation of the Fallopian tubes, which can result in temporary in fertility or in an ectopic (tubas) pregnancy. The chance of an infection from an abor tion performed under sterile conditions is minimal, but is always present; ordinary child birth also sometimes leads to such an inflammation. “It's not like a vacuum cleaner—in and out and good by,” Dr. Kaufman said. “We've had the strangulating law for 140 years, and all of a sud den the noose is off and everyone wants implementa tion, like yesterday. So we're caught between trying to get enough medical experience quickly to handle the load and trying to educate the public in how to deal with the new law.” Most doctors feel that the new law will bring a signifi cant change in their prac tices, and will challenge some well‐ingrained attitudes about abortion. Not only have few gynecologists and obstetricians performed abortions on any kind of regular basis; most of them took no part in the movements for abortion re form or repeal and, in fact, rarely had much contact with the abortion question at all. So to the average gynecol ogist or obstetrician, whose name has not been in the pa pers and who has gone quietly about his private practice, the law has really opened a closed door. “I didn't do more than whisper about abortion four months agri,” said Dr. Leon Zussman, a Manhattan gyne cologist and obstetrician who has practiced for 30 years, performed about one abortion a year and had to turn down requests for about 40 a year. “Neither did most of my friends. But now it's all we talk about — morning, noon, night and in between. Wheth er we're seeking this or not, it will fall into our laps, so what else is there to talk. “I will do abortions. Every body I know will do abor tions. But, while I am intel lectually ready, willing and able, I will still have an emotional reaction. I've been so emotionally attuned to this attitude toward abortion throughout my whole career that it will be difficult. It's a challenge. We've all been frustrated all these years by having to refuse so many, so no one will say no now. But I would not want to be known   as an abortionist. Maybe the next generation wouldn't con skier that a stigma, but with me it will persist until I die.” There will, of course, be doctors who will not perform abortions. Many of them will be Catholic; no abortions will be performed at the Catholic hospitals. All the guidelines state explicitly that no doctor can in any way be penalized for refusing to do an abor tion. Predictions range from mild to severe forms of chaos “Even Bob Hall doesn't en joy doing abortions,” Dr. Hall said. “It's not because I think I'm killing a baby. Not that. But it's the potential, the feel ing that if only this pregnancy had occurred at the right time everything could have been different. Delivering a baby, a doctor feels he is part of the process of creation, even if all he does is catch the baby when it comes out. It's a Godlike role, and we like to play it. Doctors do have a God image, and what they cannot buy now is that this law has forced them to as sume social responsibility as well.” THESE private agonies will soon be swept along by the tide when the gates open on July 1. What can we expect to see? No one expects perfec tion. No one — not even the spokesmen for the Health Services Administration, who are experts at sounding opti mistic — expects that every woman who wants an abor tion on July 1 can get one quickly, at reasonable cost and with a minimum of red tape. Predictions range from mild to severe forms of chaos. The Health Services Administra tion has announced that the 15 municipal hospitals that have obstetrical services will be able to perform between 25,000 and 30,000 abortions a year. The city is prepared to spend most of a $5‐million contingency fund to help the hospitals develop their facili ties or to hire the staff to use the facilities at normally un derused times — nights and weekends. (In fact, there is bed space in the obstetrical units of most hospitals. In 1969, the obstetrics services at the mu nicipal hospitals were utilized at an average of 61 per cent of capacity; the gynecology services, 75 per cent. In 1968, use of obstetrical beds aver aged 68 per cent of capacity at the voluntary hospitals, 61 per cent at the proprietary hospitals. Utilization is usual ly lowest in the summer. The bottleneck is staff — nurses, technicians and anesthetists as well as doctors.) A city patient will not be restricted to the municipal hospital in her neighborhood, as she now is. If there is no room in her neighborhood hos pital, an appointment will be made for the woman before she leaves the first hospital at one where there is space. Actually, any New York City resident can use a mu nicipal hospital. Patients are charged for procedures on a sliding scale depending on their ability to pay. There is no means test as such, but a patient is asked to state his or her combined family in come and to sign a form say ing that proof of income may be required. City hospital officials do not, however, expect a flood of wealthy women seeking abortions at the municipal hospitals. Private physicians cannot perform operations there, and most women who have their own gynecologists probably would not want to have their abortions done by a hospital staff doctor they had never met. The city was still trying 10 days ago to work out a fee schedule for municipal hos pital abortions. Medicaid will cover abortions for indigent patients, both single and married. MANY of the large volun tary hospitals are waiting un til after July 1 before commit ting themselves to handling any specific number of abor tions. University Hospital was the first to announce a def inite plan, and it may perhaps become a model for some of the others. The hospital will have three programs for its private patients. First, women pregnant for less than nine weeks will be given out‐patient abortions on Saturday, a day when the operating room is normally used only for emergencies. All preadmission tests must be done ahead of time in the doc tor's office. The woman comes to the hospital on Saturday morning, has the operation, stays in the recovery room for several hours and leaves in the afternoon. Twelve wom en a week will be accom modated under this program. Women 10 or 11 weeks pregnant will be admitted to   a special six‐bed unit on the hospital's gynecology floor on the afternoon of the first day. They will have the operation the following day and be dis charged on the morning of the third day. Twelve women a week will be accommodated under this program also. A simple abortion can easily cost $500, a complex one double that Finally, if a bed is available on the obstetrical floor, one woman a day will be admitted for an abortion by the salt ing‐out method. The patient, from 12 to 20 weeks pregnant, will remain in the hospital three or four days; a max imum of five a week will be admitted. University Hos pital will then be doing 29 abortions a week. That is a start, but clearly if no more than a few hospitals are will ing to make even that limited commitment, there will be trouble. As more hospitals announce their plans, the private hos pitals may set up some form of clearinghouse to keep track of available beds. One organization, the Family Plan ning Information Agency, Inc., is preparing to handle refer rals in large numbers. In May, the agency sent letters to 55, 000 gynecologists, psychia trists and general practitioners across the country announc i",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

g its referral service. Re plies came back by the hun dreds. Women calling the agency, which is housed in a converted brownstone at 160 West 86th Street, will be able to get current information on available space in both the ward and private sections of the nonmunicipal hospitals. Out ‐ of ‐ state medical soci eties and Planned Parenthood chapters will probably try to keep up‐to‐date with the New York situation. Women whose own doctors do not have con tacts in New York will sim plify their attempts to get an abortion here if they make as many arrangements as they can before they come. Calling any of these organizations would be a start. Women who arrive in New York without any arrange ments will unquestionably have the most difficult time. The municipal hospitals will not accept them and, even after getting a list of names from the county medical so ciety, they may have trouble getting appointments with busy doctors here. It is for them — especially the out‐of state poor—that abortion clin ics would make the most dif ference. But for New York women, the gap between rich and poor, which has always meant the difference between a rela tively safe or frightfully dan gerous illegal abortion, is bound to be narrowed. There may be red tape, waiting lists and impersonality at the mu nicipal hospitals, but abortions will be done there in unprece dented numbers and at low cost for people whose only previous alternative was a wire coat hanger or worse. Abortions, even where ob tainable in the private hos pitals, will not be bargains. Most gynecologists will prob ably charge between $200 and $300 for an early abortion by D‐and‐C or suction. In addi tion, the anesthetist charges about $75 and the hospital will set its own fees for use of the operating and recovery rooms, probably about $100. Laboratory fees are additional. Thus, without an overnight stay, an uncomplicated abor tion can easily cost $500. A hysterotomy or salting ‐ out procedure could easily double that figure with higher doc tor's fees and several days in the hospital at $100 a day. Blue Cross had not an nounced by mid‐June whether it would cover abortions or, if it does, whether it would limit coverage to maternity benefit contracts, which would effectively exclude single women. FOR a few days after April 10, it did look easy. A few years from July 1, when pre sumably other states will have repealed their abortion laws, efficient clinics will be oper ating and emotions will have cooled, it may look easy again. But the day when an abortion carries with it no more bu reaucratic or emotional bag gage than a tonsillectomy will be a long time coming. “The word abortion still has a seriously soiled, stained meaning,” said Dr. Bernard Nathanson. “People talk about New York becoming the abor tion capital of the world as if that would be a terrible thing. But substitute ‘heart trans plant’ — make New York the heart‐transplant capital of the world and see how their ex pressions change. Well, don't think there should be a difference. I'd be proud if New York were humane enough and had enough com passion to become the abor tion capital of the world," and I think we have to do every thing in our power to make it possible.” ■""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
New York's Democrats Now Face A Real Test,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/28/archives/new-yorks-democrats-now-face-a-real-test.html,"It was Primary Day in New York last Tuesday, but until the polls closed at 10 P.M. the ma jor impact of the election seemed to be on those unhappy souls who walked up to their neigh borhood tavern and found the lights out and a “Closed” sign on the door. The campaign had dragged on for months, with candidates finding little to dis agree about and voters finding little reason to remember to vote; in the Democratic party, with contests for everything from Governor and United States Sen ator to district leaders, only about one million of the 3.6 mil lion eligible voters came out. But there was considerable impact after the bars opened and the votes were counted. Among other things, the voters who came out had: ¶Nominated the most unbal anced statewide ticket in the history of a state whose poli ticians traditionally followed every rule of ethnic, religious and geograprilc equity. The win ners of the Democratic primary were four Jews—Arthur J. Gold berg for Governor, Richard L. Ottinger for United States Sena tor, Adam Walinsky for Attorney General and Arthur Levitt for Controller — and a Negro, Basil A. Paterson, for Lieutenant Gov ernor. And all five came from the metropolitan area — three from New York City and two from Westchester County. ¶Defeated three of the state's most senior Congressmen — Ad am Clayton Powell of Harlem, Leonard Farbstein of Manhat tan's West Side and Jacob Gil bert of the Bronx. ¶Punished two veteran state legislators who had been identi fied with passage this year of a law legalizing abortions. Clinton Dominick, the Republican who sponsored the bill in the State Senate, and George Michaels, the Democrat who dramatically cast the deciding “aye” vote in the Assembly, both loht in districts they had represented for years. Election Night Drama The drama on election night was provided by the race be tween Mr. Goldberg, who said he had polls showing he would win by better than 2 to 1, and Howard J. Samuels, a feisty un derdog who would not quit just because he was running against a former Secretary of Labor, As sociate Justice of the Supreme Court and United States repre sentative to the United Nations. In the end, Mr. Samuels got just under 48 per cent of the vote, and Mr. Goldberg's new political career survived only because the ?? where he was strongest— middle‐class Jewish neighbor hoods in the city and suburbs— voted in much heavier propor tions than in other districts. The day's leading vote‐getter was Mr. Paterson, a State Sen ator from Harlem, who many Democratic leaders wanted to keep out of the primary because they thought he would hurt the ticket. November might be a dif ferent story, but in June Mr. Paterson rolled up 70 per cent of the vote against a white sub urban opponent, Huntington (L.I.) Supervisor Jerome A. Am bro. Mr. Ottinger was also an easy winner, getting 361,556 votes to 304,481 for Paul O'Dwyer, 152, 034 for Theodore C. Sorensen and 101,803 for Richard Max McCarthy. The 41‐year‐old West chester Congressman's victory did not stun anyone, but his campaign did. Among the stunned was one of the party's highest state officials, who said, “Well, now we know, you can buy an election.” The Ottinger nomination was a tribute to the political clout of television. He began the cam paign as just another liberal Congressman, but he happened to be one whose family had made millions with the United States Plywood Company. A nice chunk of that money, at least $1‐million, went into television and radio advertising, and Mr. Ottinger's public recognition went from below 30 per cent to above 70 per cent. Serious Questions The millionaire's campaign has raised serious “questions among New York politicians—although voters did not seem to be moved by the repeated “election buy ing” charges of his opponents— and even among his own staff. The dispute within the staff ex ploded on election night, when Mr. Ottinger's advisers got into an argument over whether the candidate should use a prepared victory statement or speak ex temporaneously. Some staffers argued that the slick Ottinger television campaign was making the man “look packaged, like we're selling toothpaste or some thing.” They wanted him to “just say what you feel, be hu man.” Mr. Ottinger recited the pre pared speech, tailored to com plement his commercials. After the primary votes were counted, Mr. Goldberg said, “Now we're in the real campaign.” The real campaign will get under way in earnest on Labor Day, when the five Democrats nomi nated for statewide office last Tuesday hit the streets against Republican and Conservative party slates that did not have to face primary opposition. Governor Rockefeller will head the G.O.P. ticket with three other incumbents: Senator Charles E. Goodell, Lieut. Gov. Malcolm Wilsr and Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz. The candidate who has been asked to run what will almost certainly be a losing race is Edward V. Regan, who will he attempting to unseat Mr. Levitt. The Conservative slate is head ed by Paul L. Adams, who polled 510.000 votes four years ago while Mr. Rockefeller was de feating Frank D. O'Connor, the Democratic candidate, by 300,000 votes. The Conservative candi date for the Senate is James L. Buckley, two got 1.4 million votes two years ago. The favorites in the real cam paign, according to early polls, should be Mr. Goldberg and Mr. Goodell. But nobody, especially Mr. Goldberg, is paying much at tention to early polls. On paper, Mr. Goldberg would seem to have everything going for him. There are 3.6 million Democrats in the state, against 2.9 million Republicans, and Mr. Adams will probably take votes from Mr. Rockefeller on the right. “Time for a change” will be a Democratic issue after 12 Rockefeller years of rising ex pectations, frustrations and taxes. The Democrats' left flank finally seems secure enough— particularly because Mr. Rocke feller has some identification with President Nixon's policies— to prevent the massive liberal, Jewish and black Democratic de fections that have elected the Governor in the past. But Mr. Rockefeller is a long way from being beaten. His own polls show him in far better shape with the elettorate than he was at the beginning of the 1966 contest with Mr. O'Connor, and he is ready to pour millions of dollars and his own formi dable campaigning skills into the race. To win, the Governor must hold some of his past support in the state's Jewish communities and add new support among conservative Democrats in Irish, Italian and Polish communities. It is no accident that his search for a New York City campaign manager was confined to Italian‐ Americans before he chose Fiore vante Perzotta, a former Lindsay aide. The gubernatorial race is the one politicians care about be cause of the power and patron age it brings to a party. Demo cratic leaders desperately hope that Mr. Goldberg turns out to be a winner who can bri g their party together again after 16 dismal years of defeat. Dismal Campaign But the Goldberg primary cam paign was also pretty aismal, in the eyes of most professionals. The candidate himself is any thing but a natural politician, and his campaign organization impressed very few people. And so the Democratic summer will be devoted to research, regroup ing and rethinking about how to project a former Supreme Court Justice as a Governor and how to start tearing down Mr. Rockefeller and his not‐undis tinguished record. The New York Democrats do have a way of muffing oppor tunity. Two days after the pri mary—a primary that most Democrats thought strengthened and started uniting the party— Mr. Rockefeller was on the hustings, touring state housing projects. At one in the Inwood section of Manhattan, he met one of the Democrats' more col orful leaders, Joseph Zaretzki the minority leader of the State Senate and an early Goldberg supporter. There was a friendly hug, and Mr. Zaretzki blurted out: “No body has done anything for my district except this fellow.” That fellow, Mr. Rockefeller, beamed. “I've’ heard of the loyal op position,” a reporter mumbled, “but this is ridiculous.” —RICHARD REEVES",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sharp Battle On. Issue Of Aid to Hospitals,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/28/archives/sharp-battle-on-issue-of-aid-to-hospitals.html,"WASHINGTON — Patients lie in bed in the corridors of a small community hospital in the south. There aren't enough rooms to go around. Other patients sit in terminably in the waiting room of a large metropolitan hospital clinic in the north. That institu tion, too, is, often overcrowded. These scenes show the most visible part of the medical facil ities problem over which the President and the Congress were at odds last week. The President vetoed the bill for hospital mod ernization and construction un der the Hill‐Burton program. The House overrode the veto which must now come to a final test Tuesday in the Senate. Both sides agree there is serious problem. They disagree over what should be done. Much of the disagreement is political. Signs of overcrowding are only an obvious, visible clue to a medical facilities problem that is, itself, simply one aspect of the nation's health care prob lem. Indeed overcrowding is, in some respects, a misleading sign. There are some places in the country that have an ex cess of hospital beds. The over‐all problem is one of maldistribution; shortage of facil ities in some places; need for modernization almost every where, and the need for facili ties that will allow alternatives to conventional hospitalization for many persons who don't need acute patient care. Invisible Consequences Many consequences of the problem are not readily visible to the public, but contribute to the over‐all difficulty. There is the laboratory technician doing tests slowly by hand because the hospital lacks the automated equipment that can do the same work much faster and probably with greater accuracy. There is the nurse hampered by the obso lete design of rooms and cor ridors in which she must care for patients. And there is the case of two hospitals in the same city wastefully duplicating elaborate equipment that could be more efficiently used by sharing. All of these things bespeak the need for modernization—new types of equipment, new types of facilities. And all this costs money. The Federal Hill‐Burton pro gram has been helping American communities expand modern ize and improve their health care facilities since 1946. There is hardly a community in the coun try that has not been affected. The latest review by the Hill Burton program estimated that nearly half of the nation's 6,600 non‐Federal general hospitals need modernization or replace ment. The report said that New York State has the greatest num ber of hospital “beds” to be modernized—a total of 26,629. Pennsylvania follows with 21, 805. Of course, the term “beds” does not refer to the actual springs and mattresses of in dividual beds, but to all of the complex items of equipment, space and services that permit a hospital to give the patient who occupies that bed the care he needs. During a recent Interview, Dr. Harald M. Graning who heads the Hill‐Burton program, in dicated that lack of facilities, modernization and other im provements reverberates through the whole realm of American health care, contributing to cost, aggravating manpower short ages, even keeping patients in the hospital longer than would be necessary otherwise. As has often ‐ been the case, Congress was willing to spend more money on this program than the President and was less con cerned with establishing priori ties among the things that would be desirable if the money were available. The President singled out for particular objection a section in the bill that would have required him to spend all money appro priated for the health programs of the public health service for the current fiscal year and the next two as well. This appeared to be the point on which the issue turned. But it gave the House the opportunity to show that it is as hazardous to give the ap pearance of being against hospi tal construction as against motherhood—perhaps more so, considering the current concerns over family planning and less re strictive abortion laws. —HAROLD M.

Dissenters Win Points From A.M.A.,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/28/archives/dissenters-win-points-from-ama.html,"CHICAGO — The American Medical Association, which for the past half‐decade has often been regarded as one of the na tion's most conservative organi zations, is showing increasing evidence that it is moving from its far right political position. Evidence of the shift arose when the A.M.A.'s doctor‐politi cians assembled at the Palmer House last week for their annual convention. For two years black militants and leftist doctors pro testing the A.M.A.'s rightist ways disrupted opening day ceremonies, branding doctors as “medical profiteers,” “war col laborators” and “racists.” The script was the same last week, but this time the A.M.A. not only allowed the demonstra tion but also gave it a formal sounding board by providing a banquet room for what it termed the “consumers forum,” The dele gates adopted about 50 resolu tions ranging from the right of all Americans to have good med ical care, to abortion and other matters that were surprisingly moderate. Many of the policy statements that were passed stemmed from a liberal report prepared over the last two years containing 57 rec ommendations aimed at changing the A.M.A.'s approach to the na tion's health needs. The delegates did not buy the whole loaf, but they did face up to facts that most public health officials have long known—that new health care delivery sys tems are needed, that poverty contributes to poor health, that the reliance on the piecework, fee‐for‐service system of reim bursing doctors may be coming to an end, and that someone has to police doctors' fees. One reason for the switch un doubtedly is the awareness by some delegates, however moss back their political sympathies, that the national attitude toward medical care has changed and that most Americans believe that it should he available to everyone. Yet the steady erosion of the A.M.A.'s power may be the more important reason. While 167,000 doctors were paying dues to the A.M.A. at the start of the year, 157,000 doctors were not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
News Summary and Index,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/29/archives/news-summary-and-index-the-major-events-of-the-day.html,"MONDAY, JUNE 29, 1970 International South Vietnamese spokesmen reported yesterday a slight increase in fighting throughout South Vietnam and scattered and sporadic clashes with enemy forces south of Neak Luong in Cambodia. American troops, in the meantime, continued their withdrawal from Cambodia. [Page 1, Column 8.] The United States is being informally asked for at least $200‐million in additional emergency aid by the Saigon Government, the South Vietnamese Economics Minister said. The money, the Minister said, would help curb a severe inflationary crisis and allow sweeping economic reforms. He indi cated that devaluation was likely. [13:1.] No Government concessions were en visioned in the wake of widespread rioting, gun battles and arson in Northern Ireland, Unionist party officials indicated. One offi cial hinted of a subversive plot against the Protestant‐dominated state after the Catholic Protestant strife in which five men were killed and 240 injured. At night, British troops fired tear gas into a Catholic mob renewed violence. [1:3.] Mrs. Richard M. Nixon flew with two planeloads of United States relief supplies to Lima, Peru, and prepared to tour the Peru vian countryside. The supplies were destined for survivors of the May 31 earthquake that devastated much of northern Peru. [1:1–2.] Secretary of State Rogers discussed rela tions between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact, the crisis in the Middle East and other problems with Corneliu Manescu, the Rumanian Foreign Minister. Mr. Manescu is to meet today with Mr. Nixon at San Clemente, Calif. [11:1.] National Most of the money pledged by the Nixon Administration to help minority capitalists has not materialized, a survey found. Mr. Nixon, in campaign speeches, talked of a partnership between hundreds of large com panies and the Federal Government in pro viding the money. So far only nine companies have made money available. [1:6–7.] Governmental agencies across the nation are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to end the growing pollution of bathing beaches and ocean waters. While most of the oceanfront beaches are in good shape, tidal ?? coasts are often badly polluted. And some beaches have been closed because of oil wastes or sewage. [1:4.] Unless the Administration ends the war and curbs inflation, Senator Mark O. Hat field warned, the Republican party may turn to other candidates than President Nixon and Vice President Agnew in 1972. Mr. Hatfield, a liberal Republican, particularly criticized Mr. Nixon's “Southern strategy.” [21:3–6.] The Strategy Action Conference called by leaders of a variety of radical groups to plan new strategies to end the war got under way amid speechmaking and argumentiveness on a campus in Milwaukee. [6:3–5.] Metropolitan Acting Hospitals Commissioner Robert A. Derzon announced that only emergency abortions would be performed in city hospi tals if 22,000 nonmedical workers struck 33 voluntary hospitals on Wednesday, as they have threatened. Many of the workers are employed in municipal hospitals under affilia tion programs with voluntary hospitals. [1:5.] Declaring their “new pride,” thousands of homosexuals from all over the Northeast ral lied in Sheridan Square in Greenwich Village, marched in a 15‐block procession to Central Park and held a “gay‐in” in the Sheep Meadow. They were protesting “oppressive” laws and social conditions. [1:6–7.] Three thousand Shakespeare buffs bundled up in blankets and sleeping bags to enjoy a full night of Elizabethan drama in Central Park's Delacorte Theater. Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival troupe performed three plays on the Wars of the Roses through the night, and the ever‐present cast of “Hair” helped greet the new day's sun. [1:1–3.] The Board of Education announced that its most extensive summer recreation and instruction programs would begin on Wednes day, the day after regular classes end. Some 700,000 people are expected at 650 school buildings for the programs, which range from remedial reading classes to an early childhood program. [31:1–8.] All children found to be neglected or abused will be placed by officials under the city's Commissioner of Social Services in reorganization of Family Court procedures announced by the Appellate Division here. The new procedures, to begin July 10, stem from complaints of duplication and conflict in handling of cases.

HOSPITAL DISPUTE PERILS ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/29/archives/hospital-dispute-perils-abortions-official-says-a-strike-here-would.html,"None but emergency abor tions will be performed in mu nicipal hospitals here if non medical workers carry out their threat to strike on Wednesday, the day a liberalized abortion law takes effect throughout the state. The acting Hospitals Commis sioner, Robert A. Derzon, said yesterday that there would be a moratorium on abortions and on some other nonemergency medical services because many of the 22,000 workers threaten ing to strike for higher pay al 33 voluntary hospitals were employed in municipal hospitals that were affiliated with the private nonprofit institutions. Whether abortions will be performed in any voluntary hos pital if there is a work stop page will depend on how seri ously the individual institution is affected by a strike, a spokes man for the hospitals said yes terday. Demonstrations Planned Negotiations between Local 1199 of the Drug and Hospital Workers Union and the League of Voluntary Hospitals and Homes of New York broke off at 8:30 last night, a spokesman for the union said. The spokes man said that there had been no progress and that no re sumption of negotiations had been scheduled. At noon today, he added, union members at the 33 hos pitals that are members of the league plan to stage hour‐long demonstrations outside the hos pitals, leaving only skeleton crews on duty, to “bring home the point that they're impa tient.” The spokesman said that the union leadership hoped to avert a strike but that “some offer has to be made” by the hospitals. The union, which represents service, technical, maintenance and professional employes, is seeking an increase in wage minimums from $100 to $139.71 a week. The first offer by the hospi tals, made Saturday night, was rejected by the union, which said it provided a 6 per cent wage increase in the first year and cost‐of‐living increases in the next two years of a three‐ year contract. “As of last Friday, we had 717 applications for abortions in the municipal hospitals,” Mr. Derzon said in announcing his policy plans. “But if the strike takes place, we will perform only abortions required to safe guard the health of the preg nant patient.” Mr. Derzon said that about half the 18 municipal hospitals had affiliations with voluntary hospitals and that the. X‐ray technicians, and laboratory pro lessionals working in them were employed by the volun tary hospitals. “All our nonemergency serv ices could be affected in these places if there is a strike,” he declared. “We are seriously concerned. But nonemergency abortions are expendable under such circumstances.” Commissioner Derzon's policy statement was made during and after an appearance on WNBC TV”s “Direct Line” program. He also expressed hope that ne gotiations between the un ion and the League of Vol untary Hospitals and Homes of New York would lead to a peaceful settlement. Under the new abortion law, the most permissive in the na tion, any woman, with the con currence of her physician, may obtain an abortion up to the 24th week of pregnancy. The Roman Catholic Bishops of New York State called yes terday for citizens to ignore the new abortion law. In a statement issued yes terday by Cardinal Cooke, the Archbishop declared that “the implementation of the regres sive abortion law on July 1, 1970 begins a tragic chapter in the history of New York State.” “We strongly afirm that the change of the civil law on abor tion does not alter God”s law,” the statement continued. “The law of God and the law of our church remain unchanged. To take human life is gravely wrong. This taking of human life is particularly heinous be cause the life is innocent and defenseless. Participation Not Mandatory “We endorse the action of those hospitals which will not permit abortions to be per formed or advised. We support those doctors, nurses and other health professionals who will not participate in this grave evil of abortion.” Mr. Derzon said in the tele vised interview yesterday that Catholic hospitals were not re quired to perform abortions and that employes were not required to participate in them. He added, however, that many Catholic hospitals were setting up referral services for Catholic women who wanted abortions. Mr. Derzon estimated that about 60,000 to 70,000 abor tions in the municipal hospitals would be sought every year, and another 50,000 in the volun tary institutions here. He said the cost of a one‐day stay in a municipal hospital for an abor tion would be $104 and that in the voluntary hospitals rates would range from $125 to $350. Jews were advised yesterday by a spokesman for Orthodox rabbis that “Torah Law pro hibits abortions.” The state ment was made by Rabbi Meyer Cohen, executive director of the Union of Orthodox Rabbis of the United States and Canada. Rabbi Cohen said that “in case of a woman's serious ill ness, competent Orthodox rab binical authorities should be consulted” before a decision was made on whether she should have an abortion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Iakovos Seeking to Americanize His Orthodox Church,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/30/archives/iakovos-seeking-to-americanize-his-orthodox-church.html,"Archbishop Iakovos, the Greek Orthodox Primate of North and South America, de clared yesterday that his church must be granted more autonomy by the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Istanbul if it is to thrive in an American con text. He also urged the 1.8‐million member denomination to re verse a half century of tradi tion and, like other Eastern Or thodox churches in this coun try, switch to an English lit urgy.

Archbishop Iakovos spoke amid rising anxiety in his church over its efforts to pre serve both a Greek and an American identity. The problem is particularly serious among young people, especially those who do not speak Greek and those who enter into mixed marriages. Earlier Efforts Unsuccessful Two years ago the Clergy Laity Congress was held in Athens in an effort to reaf firm ties with the mother church in Greece, but the effort was generally regarded as a failure. In his address yesterday, Archbishop Iakovos declared that the concept of dual loyal ties “cannot be continued in definitely.” “It is a fact that we are embracing new ideas and new traditions,” he said. “Our church is slowly, but surely, becoming an indigenous church.” The Archbishop informed delegates that he was suggest ing to the appropriate commit tees two proposals designed to make the church more relevant to its American surroundings. The first was to grant more “de facto autonomy” to the archdiocese. In an interview after, his address, which was read for him in English by an aide, the Archbishop said: “If we are to serve our people fully, we must be able to speak out on issues like abortion, birth control and mixed mar riages.” Official positions on such matters must now be cleared by the Archbishop's immediate superior, Athenagoras I, the ecumenical patriarch in Istan bul. English Liturgy Urged Archbishop Iakovos also asked the delegates to approve use of an English translation of the Divine Liturgy and to per mit the use of an abbreviated version. He expressed confi dence that the delegates would “decide favorably” on both matters. The proposal took on added interest because of the action of the Russian Orthodox lead ership in Moscow last April in granting autonomy to a new Orthodox Church of America. The Russians expressed hope that this would become the basis of a single autonomous church of all Orthodox Christ ians in this country. Archbishop Iakovos has long expressed hope of bringing about such a unified church through le Standing Confer ence of Canonical Orthodox Bishops in the Americas, which he heads, and initially he crit icized the move as contrary to canon law. Later, however, he changed his position and de clared his willingness to cooperate through the confer ence. More autonomy for the Greek Orthodox archidoese would presumably facilitate eventual union with other Orthodox churches. It was also noted that most other Orthodox denominations had already switched to English and that comparable move by the Greeks would eliminate a point on which their leadership has been challenged by other Orthodox leaders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Books of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/30/archives/books-of-the-times-an-essay-on-morals.html,"Daniel Callahan — director of the Insti tute of Society, Ethics and the Life Sciences, former executive editor of Com monweal magazine, and a Doctor of Phi losophy from Harvard—began this book four years ago with the intention of “de fending, with some modifications, the tra ditional Western prohibition against abor tion.” His formidable researches caused to change his mind. He now believes that the State has no right to re fuse an abortion to a woman who wants one, and he proposes permissive legislation to that effect. ABORTION: LAW, CHOICE AND MORALITY. By Daniel Callahan. 524 pages. Macmillan. $14.95. Naturally, such a change will displease those Roman Catholic and Protestant con servatives who insist that the fertilized egg is a human being, and that to interfere with it after implantation is to commit murder. But to change one's mind isn't necessarily to reverse all one's perceptions and convictions as though they were a raincoat. His book will also displease those who subscribe to Ti‐Grace Atkinson's no tion that the woman is an artist, that “her reproductive function and the fetus con stitute her property,” and that she can destroy the fetus as she might destroy a painting, up to the point at which she de cides to confer “child‐status” or “person hood” on it by expelling it from her body. Legality and Morality Dr. Callahan believes that what is (or should be) legal may not always be moral. Legality is a shifting process of accommo dation between individual rights and social needs. If legal abortions do not threaten a society, and he demonstrates that they do not, then the individual right of a woman to control her own body and plan her own family takes precedence. But is abortion the only way to protect that right? Shouldn't society see to it that other options are avail able to women who don't want children for medical, psychological or socioeco nomic reasons? And, in the process, shouldn't society grapple with the genuine moral issues raised in the abortion debate? For abortion is a moral problem. As Thomas Szasz has said, “To be sure, the procedure is surgical; but this makes abor tion no more a medical problem than the use of the electric chair makes capital punishment a problem of electrical en gineering.” (And Szasz supports legalized abortion.) What do we mean by such phrases as “the sancity of life”? Can secu lar and religious apprehensions of that sanctity be brought into useful approxi mation? Dr. Callahan argues (and I agree) that the effort to do so, drawing on all our resources in science, philosophy and history, is crucial. Should “life” be defined only as what a majority of voters in any political subdivision decides it to be, then we enter a universe of expediency, and can go about defining black people, South east Asians, Indians, the aged, infirm, long‐haired and ideologically delinquent as not quite to our standards. If Dr. Callahan's method is mechanical —first examining the medical and psycho logical reasons for (and hazards of) abor tion, then the fetal situation, followed by a reprise of the legal codes, statistical experience and ethical perceptions of Eastern Europe, Latin America, Scandi navia, Africa and Japan, on to what philosophers, biologists, Catholics and lib erated women say about the subject—his motion is toward a “moral policy.” As ours should be unless we are asparagus or the Joint Cheats of Strafe. As method and motion proceed on two different levels in this book, so the prac tical and the abstract seem to occupy different stories in the same intellectual apartment house. Dr. Callahan weighs the arguments against abortion (legitimate medical and psychological reasons are rare; a better society could take care of socioeconomic problems; nobody can agree on when “life” actually starts) and the arguments for it (women's rights; over population; the butchery of illegal abor tions under restrictive systems)—and can eludes that the balance favors permissive ness. Probing Certain Abstractions But he digs his heels into certain ab stractions: While abortion may serve the laudable end of our “control of the kind and quality of human life,” it is at best “to be looked upon with ambivalence... Any method which requires the taking of human life, even though that life be far more potential than actual, falls short of the human aspiration, in mankind's better moments, of dignifying and protecting life.” He urges us to continue to worry about the morality of it until “a method of birth control is discovered which does not require that we make a choice between the life of a conceptus and those other human values and goods we count im portant.” I have no doubt that most people, whether or not they approve of abortion, will appreciate the data in Dr. Callahan's book more than they will appreciate the scruples. We are, after all, coming around to certain new social truths—that women aren't prepared to die in behalf of male definitions of female roles; that contracep tion has not only altered sexual roles, but philosophical categories as well; that the natural law, knowing what we now know about nature, isn't quite good enough for man (or nature)—and why, some might ask, doesn't Dr. Callahan brood about the “Just War” theory or racism or something important? To which I think he would answer: every issue has its scruple; the scruples connect even if the issues don't; to ignore the scruple while riding the issue is to sow the Zeitgeist and reap the disaster. What makes “Abortion: Law, Choice and Morality” the valuable book it is, is the fact that it takes morals seriously. To de fine what's right, to choose to do it, to help create a world in which the right thing can be chosen and might survive ... these are endeavors as worthy as they are rare, in philosophy and in poli tics and in private life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Women's Lib Headquarters,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/01/archives/womens-lib-headquarters.html,"There is no sign, just a symbol and a bell at the side of the entrance to the loft building at 36 West 22d Street. The motif—the palm of a hand with four fingers raised within a circle and cross peace symbol — is the mark of the women's liberation movement, whose communications center is housed on the second floor. There, the atmosphere is a mixture of sorority house and campaign headquarters. Young women with shining hair and faces devoid of make‐up are filing, writing, planning and compiling a library. Telephones ring and girlish voices answer them and call out, “Is anyone here from day care?, “When is the next Joan Bird meeting?"" “Judy, come talk to Sue.” Joan Bird is one of 13 Black Panthers awaiting trial here. She is held in the Women's House of Detention in $100,000 bail, which women's liberation sympathizers are trying to raise. Variety of Messages Bulletin boards are encrusted with notices and messages. Karate lessons and a speech by Aileen Hernandez, president of NOW—the National Organization for Women;—abortion counseling and child‐care picketing; a contact for women with drug problems; “Up From Under” is going to talk to women in housing projects; a mother of a 10‐month‐old baby just left by husband needs crib, playpen and stroller; the Radical Lesbians are having a dance and “Bitch” (the new women's lib organization that recently staged man‐ogling sessions on Wall Street and midtown) is having a meeting. Requests for speakers on women's liberation have been received from the New Jersey Junior Women's Club and the North Shore Rotary. Lists of women's liberation groups (Park Slope Women's Lib, Older Women's Liberation, Consciousness‐Raising for Lower Westchester) and of women seeking a group with which they can affiliate. “This is more of a woman's space than a political place,” said one of the staff who prefer, according to the tenets of radical feminism, to remain anonymous. The center is open to all women regardless of degree of feminist belief. It has no officers — “so we don't become elitist,” one of the women said—or employes and is run by volunteers from a number of women's liberation groups, ranging from the radically oriented to those primarily concerned with the defense of the Black Panthers. Financial support is informal and comes from contributions and dues paid by some women's collectives. Part of the fee paid by the Ladies Home Journal to a women writers collective for contributing to a forthcoming women's liberation section (one of the concessions wrested as the result of a sit‐in at the magazine last March) was given to the Woen's Liberation Center. The center serves as a meeting place for groups and a clearinghouse for information about the movement, which is growing rapidly but is largely unstructured. Growth of Mcivement It opened last April after women's liberation had begun to resemble an epidemic and to show symptoms of becoming one of the major movements of the seventies. Since last fall, groups have been sprouting on college campuses, in industry and in the suburbs. Most women's liberation groups are small, fluid and lack offices or telephone numbers. Use of the Women's Liberation Center and its services is free, although there is a token charge for some printed materials, for women's liberation buttons (25 cents) and posters ($1). The center is open Monday through Friday from 10 A.M. to 10 P.M., Saturdays from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. and Sundays from noon to 6 P.M.

State's Liberal Abortion Law Takes Effect Today Amid Prospects for Initial Delays,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/01/archives/states-liberal-abortion-law-takes-effect-today-amid-prospects-for.html,"The nations’ most liberal abortion law goes into effect in New York State today amid controversy and confusion over how many women will seek abortions, how an abortion can be obtained, how much it will cost and whether the hospitals will be able and willing to meet the demand. Adding to the confusion a threatened walkout by nor medical hospital workers voluntary hospitals. This coul, severely curtail the number abortions hospitals in the cit: will be able to do. For the last two months, hos pitals in New York City have been preparing to meet the de mand for abortions under the new law, which leaves the de cision to have an abortion ur to the woman and her doctor The law permits most abortion: to be performed within the firs 24 weeks or pregnancy. Salary Confusion Noted As the deadline drew near last night, some hospitals were still preparing facilities, purchasing equipment and hiring the personnel they will need to operate their abortion services. One chief of obstetrics at city hospital reported yesterday that he was unable to hire the needed personnel because of uncertainty over how much he could spend on salaries. Another obstetrical chief remarked: “I'm turning gray over the confusion about abortions. But I do feel it will turn out all right in the end.” At the Family Planning Information Service, operated by Planned Parenthood of New York as a citywide clearinghouse for abortion patients, the phones have been ringing constantly for the last three days. A spokesman reported that more than 100 calls were received yesterday. More than 700 women have already been scheduled to receive abortions in municipal hospitals, beginning today, and abortion services in a number of hospitals — both municipal and voluntary — are already fully booked through July. Six‐Month Delay Seen Dr. Shirley A. Mayer, assistant commissioner of maternal and child care services at the Health Department, concedes that women might encounter delays at first in obtaining abortions because of the backlog of patients who have been waiting for the new law to take effect. However, she says, “within six months we expect a leveling—a trade‐off in which a reduction in the number of births and number of women we have to treat for [illegally induced] septic abortions will increase our capacity to perform abortions.” Estimates of the demand for abortions among city women have ranged from 50,000—representing one abortion for every three live births—to 100,000 a year. A Health Department survey has indicated that hospitals in the city could handle the lower figure and perhaps as many as 75,000. Although new guidelines issued by the Board of Health would permit abortions to be performed in special clinics, no such clinics are expected to be in operation for some months. Noting that an uncontrolla ble influx of women from out of the state could swell the demand for abortions to as many as 500,000 a year, several groups have called for further relaxation of the guidelines to permit abortions early in pregnancy to be done in doctors’ offices. Although priority under the new law is to be given to state residents, doctors and hospitals will be hard put to ascertain the true residency of women who ask them for abortions. In addition to out‐of‐state women, the demand for abortions at the city's hospitals may be further increased by women from upstate New York, where a check of the large hospitals revealed that few were prepared to meet the demand they anticipate. A woman seeking an abortion is advised by the City Health Department to “get advice from your doctor or hospital clinic right away,” since “waiting can endanger your health.” In a new leaflet, “If You Want an Abortion...""—a half a million copies of which are being distributed—the Health Department urges women who have missed a menstrual period but are not certain they are pregnant to get a pregnancy test right away. The test can be given by a doctor or hospital or a Health Department maternity and family planning center. A pregnant woman who wants an abortion, the department says, should see her doctor immediately. If she has no doctor, she should go to her neighborhood hospital and ask at the information desk for the abortion service. If neither her doctor nor her local hospital can help her, the department advises the woman to call the Family Planning! Information Service at 777‐45041 to be referred to a doctor or, hospital that can serve her. The New York City Health and Hospital Corporation has designated two special numbers that any woman who has difficulty being scheduled for an abortion may call. The numbers are 566‐8063 and 566‐8069, and they will be open Mondays through Fridays between A.M. and 5 P.M. The cost of an abortion under the new law will vary according to where and how it is done and who does it. A woman who was on Medicaid at the time she got pregnant will have her abortion cornpletely paid for. For a non‐Medicaid patient at a city hospital, the total cost of an abortion is expected to be between $110 and $125. The same, or slightly higher, rates will apply to ward patients at voluntary hospitals. The cost to a private patient, however, will depend largely upon how much her physician charges for his services and at what stage of pregnancy the abortion is done. The Medical Society of the State of New York has recommended that doctors charge $100 to $150 for outpatient abortions and $200 to $250 for those that require a hospital stay. However, some doctors are expected to charge considerably more. Added to the doctor's fee will be the laboratory and hospital charges, which could easily run into several hundred dollars if several nights are spent in the hospital. In general, the later in pregnancy an abortion is done the more it will cost, since the techniques that must be used beyond the third month of pregnancy are complicated and require several days in the hospital. Toward these fees, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Greater New York will contribute up to $300, depending on the type of contract, for married or single women who receive abortions in hospitals. The Health Insurance Plan of New York will cover doctor's services for all hospital abortions performed by doctors in the plan. Other medical insurance companies have not yet decided whether to extend their abortion coverage to unmarried women.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Where Birth and Abortion Cases Meet,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/02/archives/where-birth-and-abortion-cases-meet.html,"Ten of 14 women who applied for care at Harlem Hospital's obstetrics and gynecology clinic yesterday wanted abortions and often made their need known only after a great deal of hesitancy as nurses delicately questioned them. The four other women wanted to have babies, and the two categories of patients sat together on benches in the clinic's waiting room, facing movie screen on which films were shown about the process and joy of childbirth. The films, a feature of the clinic long before the new liberalized abortion law went into effect yesterday, underlined the sensitivity of the new task assumed by the busy staff of the city hospital. In recent weeks, as patients were processed in advance of the new law, one woman who had signed up for an abortion watched the maternity films while waiting for an examination, changed her mind and went back to the nurse to say, “I want to have the baby.” A ‘Confrontation of Values’ But another woman applying for an abortion objected, according to the nurses, saying: “I shouldn't have to sit through that.” Although the hospital is pressed for space, the woman was permitted to wait away from the green‐and‐violet‐tiled waiting room, where most of the women are usually obviously pregnant and returning for regular maternity checkups. “It's a total confrontation of values, and the two services don't go together very well,” said Caroline Manuele, a nurse. Ideally, members of the staff said, there should be two clinics, with abortions separate, but the July 1 deadline did not allow for this. Dr. Donald Swartz, director of obstetrics and gynecology at the hospital, said that preparations had been under way since the law was passed and that the staff had not been caught short yesterday in the clinic at West 136th Street and Fifth Avenue. But the nurses said there was always a crucial question that could not be avoided. This is whether a woman wants to have an abortion or to give birth. The registration and medical history forms are the same for both procedures and so are the initial medical examinations, with the exception of an extra blood test for an abortion applicant. Hesitancy at Times Stella Washington, a nurse, explained that the women often did not state directly and immediately their wish and that the staff hesitated to bring up the subject of abortion. “We can't be in the position of seeming to suggest such an operation,” Miss Washington said, noting that one or two women who turned out to be looking forward to maternity had been shocked and insulted at the mention of abortion. “But we have to know, since there are Catholic doctors here and we can't refer the women [abortion cases] to them,” Miss Washington continued. “You look for little clues—facial expressions or something —but you can't be sure,” Miss Manuele added. “After getting no indication and talking around the subject, you wind lip asking something like, ‘Do you plan to Continue this pregnancy?’ “ If the woman answers no and her medical state is acceptable, she might undergo one more check before entering the hospital for the 30‐minute abortion operation. At present there is wait of about one week between acceptance by the clinic and the operation. The hospital, which performed a total of about 15 abortions a year under the old, more stringent law, is prepared to handle 20 to 30 operations a week under the new law. It is a two‐day procedure, Dr. Swartz said, although there are plans for an ambulatory service in which a woman could check in the morning, undergo the operation and return home in the evening. Dr. Swartz said that estimates of Harlem's needs for abortion ranged from 1,000 to 3,000 a year and that the hospital “can cope with that quite satisfactorily.” Requests From Other States “The new law is extremely desirable,” he added. Its effect on the hospital will depend on Whether other states liberalize their laws, he indicated. The hospital has received telephone inquiries from women in Chicago and Connecticut about possible abortions at Harlem Hospital. And letters have been sent by newly pregnant women and their families from such distant places as the West Indies. “One woman flew up from the islands and applied here because she had relatives in the community,” a staff member said. Others have come from other neighborhoods in the city where the waiting time for an abortion was longer. And middleincome women have applied for clinic care. Priority under the new law is to be given to New York City residents, and should the local demand become heavy enough, this could lead, in effect, to banning out‐of‐state residents, according to city officials. The city's policy also provides that when a woman from, say, Queens finds her local city hospital overbooked on abortions, she should join a central waiting list and be assigned to a city hospital with a lighter abortion schedule. For those who are not medically indigent, the city charges fees based on a sliding income scale. A single woman earning $15,000 a year, for example, would pay the full rates of $26 for each clinic visit plus $104 for each day in the hospital, which includes the fee for the abortion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some of the Busiest Phones in the City,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/02/archives/some-of-the-busiest-phones-in-the-city.html,"Man from Florida: “My wife and I are out at Kennedy Airport. We flew to New York so she could get an abortion. What can we do?” Teen‐age girl from Queens: “I'm 10 weeks pregnant, and my doctor wants $605 for an abortion. My boy friend can't afford it. What can I do?” New Jersey woman, 25 years old: “I'm pregnant, but I'm in the process of getting divorced. Can you give me the name of a good doctor?” These people, generally calm—but occasionally hysterical—were among 350 who dialed 777‐4504 yesterday, the day when New York's new liberalized abortion law went into effect. The telephone number, which has 16 trunk lines, is that of the Family Planning Information Service, the division of Planned Parenthood, of New York City, Inc., 300 Park Avenue South, that provides information free. The service was begun with two employes in March, 1969, to give callers information on birth control, infertility, voluntary sterilization and related subjects. But in recent weeks, as July 1 approached, the service expanded its staff to 10—four of them registered nurses —in response to the deluge of calls from people seeking abortion information. (The phones are manned from 9 A.M. to 7 P.M. Monday through Friday and until 5.P.M. on Saturday.) Not Form of Birth Control Alfred F. Moran, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood of New York City, said he wanted to emphasize that his organization did not look upon abortion as another form of birth control. “We regard it as a back‐up service only,” he said yesterday, as telephone calls poured in. “An abortion is not like 30 days in the country, you know. It's no fun.” The first thing all callers are asked is whether they have had their pregnancy confirmed. If the answer is yes, the caller is referred to a doctor or a hospital in her area. (The man froth Florida was told to bring his wife to Planned Parenthood headquarters In New York for a conference with a staff member. The teen‐ager from Queens was given the name of a hospital in her neighborhood and told to call back Thursday if the hospital wouldn't take her. The New Jersey woman was given the name of.a private doctor in Manhattan.) Occasionally, the switchboard in the tiny office was so swamped with calls that six or seven callers at a time were put on “hold.” Many of them just hung up. “I have a feeling that the abortion situation in this City Is going to be impossible!” said Mrs. Katie Dabbs, a registered nurse who heads the Family Planning Information Service. “The hospitals just aren't going to be able to take all these people.” Calls From Out of State Mrs. Dabbs said she had had “oodles and oodles” of calls from out‐of‐state residents who were coming to New York to seek abortions. (Yesterday, about 40 per cent of the callers were not New Yorkers.) One woman, from Norfolk, Va., called long distance to see‐if the service had any information on a doctor whose name she had been given. The doctor was not listed in the service's medical directory. “I'm coming anyway,” the Virginian vowed. Some of the other callers included a 42‐year‐old woman from Bay Shore, L. I., who felt she was too old to have another child; a woman from Pennsylvania who wanted to terminate her pregnancy because her husband had had a hervous breakdown, and a man who wanted to know how to go about setting up an abortion clinic. The callers were not always coddled. One of them, a 25‐year‐old woman from New Jersey who said she was 14 weeks pregnant, refused to give Mrs. Dabbs her name. “Look, miss,” Mrs. Dabbs said brusquely, remembering how a doctor had just refused to do an abortion on a woman who was 19 weeks pregnant, “if you don't have something done soon, you're not going to be able to have anything done.” Once a woman decides to terminate an unwanted pregnancy, just what does she do? And what is it like to have an abortion? For weeks now, hospitals in the city have been performing abortions to test their facilities in anticipation of a flood of requests. Here, reporter Joan Cook gives the case histories of two women : one, a married woman with two children who had an abortion last week, before the new law took effect yesterday; the other, a single, working girl, 15 weeks pregnant, who has already been through her preliminary physical examination at a city hospital clinic and will soon have an abortion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A SINGLE GIRL,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/02/archives/a-single-girl.html,"Nineteen‐year‐old Eleanor Patterson, a college student who is a Roman Catholic and lives with her parents on the East Side, arrives at Metropolitan Hospital, 1901 First Avenue, alone. Unmarried, she is 15 weeks along in her first pregnancy. She did not use contraceptives and said she was “turned off” by mechanical devices, but might be interested in taking birth control pills. Hoping to cut down on the waiting time, Eleanor (a fictional name) comes to the hospital's Family Planning Clinic, after referral from its department of obstetrics and gynecology, at 8:20 A.M. After an hour's wait, she is ushered into a small conference room to fill out a hospital form. The form includes the patient's name, address, telephone number, age, race, occupation and marital status. Other questions ask about previous pregnancies and their results, previous abortions and the type, number of children now living, date of last abortion or delivery and whether or not pregnancy is the result of contraceptive failure. If so, what method was used? The interviewer, Rose Raveneau, a research associate in the clinic who appears to be hardly more than a girl herself, is patient, polite and efficient. She correlates medical information from other departments, sees that applications are processed as swiftly as possible (the hospital's service is already booked solid through the first two weeks in July). The forms completed, Miss Raveneau asks Eleanor for a urine sample and tells her to return for her physical. The specimen turned in, Eleanor joins the other women on the brightly colored bucket chairs in the clinic's waiting room. Care in clinics requires patience and waiting is inevitable. To pass the time, Eleanor, who is wearing a short, blue jacket and a plaid miniskirt, chats with a pretty, young Puerto Rican mother who is married, has two children, 8 and 9, and does not wish to have a third now because she is about to move. It is her first abortion, too. “If it had happened next year, I'd have had it,” she confided to her new friend. It will take time, the mother says, for her children to adjust to a new school and a new neighborhood, and she wants to see them settled before she thinks about enlarging her family. Worried About Boss Eleanor discusses the job she has just started in an art store and says she hopes that the hospital will give her a slip for her boss so that he won't dock her for taking the day off. Assured by a passing nurse that she would be given such a slip, Eleanor is relieved, especially when told that the reason for her visit will be kept confidential. When it is her turn to be examined, she stops at Miss Raveneau's desk to request that the hospital not notify her at home or of her appointment date for the abortion because she doesn't want her mother to know. Miss Raveneau, in turn, gives her a telephone number to call next week and promises her that at that time, she will be given a definite date. Already 15 weeks pregnant, Eleanor is too far along for suction techniques and must wait a week or more for her abortion. From the 12th to the 16th or 18th week, it is too difficult to tap the uterine cavity so that the “salting out” process can be safely carried out. Somewhere between the 16th and the 20th week of her pregnancy, Eleanor will return to the hospital to have a hypodermic needle inserted through the abdomen and uterine wall into the amniotic fluid and the fetus. About 200 cubic centimeters of amniotic fluid are removed and replaced by no more than that amount of a 20 per cent saline solution. It is this that kills the fetus and induces labor, which begins from 12 to 36 hours after the injection. Twelve to 36 hours later, the fetus is expelled in a normal delivery. Under the new law, an abortion can be performed through the 24th week of pregnancy, but in this stipulation, according to Dr. Myron Gordon, director of the Family Planning Service, New York Medical College, the law is medically off‐base. “We would be extremely loathe to abort any woman after the 20th week without full medical and psychiatric recommendations,” Dr. Gordon said. “That's the trouble with laws that pertain to medical matters being made by politicians.” Seemingly Unconcerned Unlike many of the women who are in the clinic this day, Eleanor is seemingly unconcerned about the medical, economic or emotional implications of abortion. To a stranger, she conveys the impression that it is like having your hair done—time‐consuming but neces sary. Since she has just started her jab and has few savings, the chances are that Eleanor will pay the hospital little or nothing for her abortion, despite the fact that her advanced pregnancy, which requires the more involved, procedure, will mean a longer hospital stay (four days or more depending on the case). Eleanor will be treated in pleasant surroundings. There will’ be no onus on her unmarried status and, save for the long hours of waiting and being a ward patient instead of a private patient, the only, difference in her care from. that offered in a private hospital will be that the abortion will not be performed by her own doctor but by one of a team of doctors, part of the New York Medical College's staff. When the operation is over, she will be asked again if she is interested in any kind of contraception from pills to intrauterine devices, foams, jellies and diaphragms. If she shows interest, a nurse or family planning counselor will explain the various contraceptives and see to it that she leaves the hospital fully equipped. While the nurses in the Family Planning Service are pleasant and efficient, they are only a fraction of the hospital's nurses—not all of whom regard abortion cases in a friendly light. “It's understandable,” said Dr. Martin Stone, chief of obstetrics and gynecology. “The nurses in family planning recognize the implications of having unwanted children because they are closely involved with families. But nurses and doctors, too, are a part of our society, which for years has regarded abortion as a part of penal law. “Too many of our nurses have had experiences withcriminal abortions and have seen patients brought here in terrible condition after go. ing to some neighborhood’ abortionist who bungled the job,” he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Abortions Begun in State Under Liberal New Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/02/archives/abortions-begun-in-state-under-liberal-new-law-scores-get-abortions.html,"Scores of abortions were performed in hospitals throughout the state yesterday on the day a new state law—the nation's most liberal on abortions—went into effect. Checks showed there were 147 terminations of pregnancy in 42 public, voluntary and proprietary hospitals here and upstate. Some other abortions were reported to have been performed in physicians’ offices. Complete official data here will not be available until next week. In the 15 municipal hospitals equipped to terminate pregnancies 208 more patients registered for future abortions yesterday, bringing the applications in those hospitals to 1,263. The municipal hospitals have prepared for as many as 600 abortions a week, according to Robert Derzon, acting executive vice president of the new City Health and Hospitals Corporation. Many hospitals in the city had hesitated to book operations for yesterday because of the threat of a strike against voluntary institutions—a threat that was averted only in the morning. Some such as Mount Sinai later brought in patients whose operations had been deferred. Other hospitals reported that they had already increased their abortions in the last month. They did this by invoking liberal interpretations of the new law which permits elective operations, though they reported that they still used screening committees to authorize “therapeutic abortions” in keeping with the old law. Thus Flower and Fifth Avenue Hospitals performed 118 therapeutic abortions during June, according to Dr. Martin L. Stone, chief of obstetrics and gynecology there with about 200 at its municipal affiliate, Metropolitan Hospital. Previously they had carried out about 12 therapeutic abortions a year. Huge Influx Expected One pair of proprietary hospitals—Park East, with 118 beds at 122 East 83d Street and Park West with 76 beds at 176 West 76th Street—were described by Ronald Shaw consultant‐administrator as prepared to handle nearly 30,000 abortions a year. Mr. Shaw, with similar hospital experience in England said that the two hospitals here had averaged about 80 unused beds a day and that these were now available for abortions. He said the two hospitals handled 10 abortions yesterday and booked 64 for the next three days with “physicians ringing in every half hour.” The two hospitals Mr. Shaw said, will charge about $575 for a minimum stay of 24 hours including doctors fees and laboratory tests with no additional charge if a patient has to stay more than that time. Voluntary nonprofit hospitals reported plans for single‐day charges ranging from $100 to $300 a day with physician's fees on top of this in some cases. Municipal Fees Vary Mr. Derzon who had been acting City Hospitals Commissioner until the municipal hospitals were turned over yesterday to the new public corporation, said the municipal hospital charges were $104 a day. The municipal charges which will be covered for medically indigent patients by Medicaid but which will be paid by patients who can afford them include physicians pharmacists’ and other services and medicines. Municipal clinic outpatient ?? cost $2 or $5 for most patients but could run up to $26 for persons of means. The new law permits abortion on consent between a woman and her physician “under a reasonable belief that such act is necessary to preserve her life,” or “within 24 weeks from the commencement of her pregnancy.” The City Health Services Administration said yesterday that 55 voluntary and 26 proprietary hospitals as well as the 15 municipal hospitals equipped to handle abortions had reported readiness to carry out the operations here so far out of 136 queried in a survey. Catholic Participation Barred While eight of the 13 Roman Catholic hospitals here have maternity wards Catholic hospitals throughout the state are bound by guidelines issued by the state's Catholic Bishops last week: None are to admit patients for abortions and no doctors or nurses are to participate in abortions in any hospital, whether a Catholic institution or not. St. Vincent's Hospital and some others printed up small cards stating their policy against abortions and giving the telephone number of the Health Department. Dr. Jules Rifkind, a non‐Catholif obstetrician at St. Vincent's, said he opposed abortions himself on ethical grounds. In a check of voluntary hospitals, New York Hospital and Flower and Fifth Avenue reported the largest number of abortions yesterday 10 each followed by the Beth Israel Medical Center, with nine. Others included St. Luke's six; Roosevelt, five; New York Polyclinic, four; Albert Einstein College of Medicine French, Jamaica the Lutheran Medical Center and Presbyterian, three each; Community Hospital of Brooklyn, Hospital for Joint Diseases, Jewish Memorial and Mount Sinai, two each, and Richmond Memorial and Staten Island, one each. City Institutions Report The municipal hospitals’ records, as compiled by William Kerr, assistant to Dr. Joseph F. English, president of the Health and Hospitals Corporation was as follows: Morrisania five abortions Harlem, Lincoln and Metropolitant and Queens General, three each; Elmhurst, Kings County and Sydenham two each and Greenpoint, one. The State University Hospital of the Downstate Medical. Center in Brooklyn reported four such operations with a fifth case developing a spontaneous miscarriage. In the suburbs, reports cited five abortions at the Nassau County Medical Center in East Meadow and two each at Smithtown and Huntington Hospitals in Suffolk County and Grasslands Hospital in Valhalla. Upstate 14 abortions were reported in Buffalo, 13 in Rochester and six in Albany. Clearinghouse Set Up Dr. Edwin F. Daily director of the City Health Department's maternity and infant carefamily planning health projects reported the municipal hospitals had set up a clearinghouse through which an overburdened public hospital could make arrangements to book an abortion patient into another municipal hospital. Eight such cases yesterday morning led to bookings for seven operations elsewhere within a week. Dr. Daily said letters were being sent to 10 voluntary hospitals that have been cooperating in the city maternity‐care program, inviting them to join the clearinghouse effort. In a different venture, Dr. Daily said 22 community workers were added yesterday to 54 already at work in 15 municipal hospitals in a program to discuss family planning with patients before they go home. Contraceptive Aid Given The program has been operating for a year during which 23,000 patients of all kinds have been interviewed in municipal and voluntary hospitals and 91 per cent have asked to be helped with a contraceptive plan before going home, Dr. Daily said. “If we had done a good job in family planning in the city, state and nation, we wouldn't have abortions,” the city official commented. The City Health Department began distributing yesterday new certificates on which physicians are to report “termination of pregnancy” in cases where the pregnancies are less than 16 weeks old. These forms replace former fetal death certificates for such early cases. The death certificates are still required in longer‐term cases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DOCTORS HERE GET ABORTION LESSON,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/02/archives/doctors-here-get-abortion-lesson-80-learn-office-and-clinic.html,"About 80 doctors attended “teach‐in” here yesterday to learn how to do abortions safely in their offices or in clinics. The lessons were sponsored by the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws, a New York‐based organization that has devoted itself to making inexpensive, safe abortion: readily available to all women who want them. While doctors at the teach‐in, held at New York University Medical Center, listened to experts describe office‐abortion techniques and the precaution they must take to avoid mishaps, eight young women were undergoing abortions in a doctor's office on the Lower West Side. Office abortions, although legal under the state's new abortion law, are in defiance of the guidelines that have beer promulgated by the State Health Department and the City Board of Health. Two of the women, who said they felt “just fine,” described their “uneventful” experience at a news conference yesterday afternoon at the Tuscany, 120 East‐39th Street. The conference was held under the auspices of the Women's Abortion Project, which is planning to open a clinic to give abortions for $50 in the next few weeks to treat patients who are less than 12 weeks pregnant. ‘I Feel Fantastic’ One of the women, a smiling, unmarried 25‐year‐old New Yorker who had been 12 weeks pregnant, said she had experienced only “very slight pain” during her abortion, even though she was given no anesthetic. The second woman, 21 years old and from Chicago, said there had been “nothing horrible” about her experience. “I feel fantastic,” she remarked, “even better than I did when I was pregnant.” One doctor who participated in the teach‐in, Dr. Bernard Nathanson, said he intended to defy the city guidelines by doing abortions in his office, even if those guidelines were made part of the City Health Code, which would give them force of law. Dr. Nathanson, director of gynecology at the Hospital for Joint Diseases and on the staffs of Cornell, New York and St. Luke's Hospitals, is medical consultant to the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion laws. He said he would “invite the police” in order to challenge the legality of the Board of Health's restrictions. Asks Reasonable Cost Dr. Nathanson also deplored what he called “the third set of covert guidelines” that have been imposed by some ‘hospitals to limit the number and kinds of abortions done on their premises. “In one case,” Dr. Nathanson said, “the attending staff was told ‘only one abortion pet week’ In another, consultants will be required for any abortion done beyond the 12th week of pregnancy.” He said that under such circumstances, office abortions were necessary to make the procedure readily available to all who needed it at a reasonable cost—which he said need not exceed $200. Lawrence Lader, president of the association, said he was negotiating with the Professional Insurance Company in New York to obtain malpractice insurance that would cover doctors who did abortions in their offices or in clinics. Aryeh Neier, lawyer with the New York Civil Liberties Union, noted that “the more doctors who do abortions in their offices and are willing to testify to this, the less danger there would be of a malpractice case,” since malpractice is based on deviation from the “accepted medical practice” in the community.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2 Women Who Decided on Abortions, but for Different Reasons",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/02/archives/2-women-who-decided-on-abortions-but-for-different-reasons-a-wife-a.html,"At 44, Mary Smith is an attractive, honey‐haired housewife who has been married close to 20 years and is the mother of two sons, John, 18, and Eric, 17, to whom she is obviously devoted. Hers is a close marriage, made more so, perhaps, by Eric's defective heart, a condition that has plagued the boy since birth. Her husband, John, is a dentist. The family (the names have been changed) live in an old but attractive house in the Douglaston section of Queens. Last week, Mrs. Smith went to see her obstetrician for the first time in some years. “I'm either pregnant or in menopause, and in either case, I need you,” she said. Once the diagnosis was made, Mrs. Smith was sure. “I'm too old to start again with a baby,” she told her doctor. “I don't have the patience. I want an abortion.” Friday afternoon, Mrs. Smith packed an overnight bag, and her husband drove her to Flower & Fifth Avenue Hospitals, Fifth Avenue at 106th Street, where she was admitted for a therapeutic abortion. After she registered, she was taken to a private room on the fifth floor at 4:30 P.M. She had a light hospital dinner at which she picked, chatted with her husband until visiting hours were over, and then settled down with “a dirty novel,” Jacqueline Susann's latest book. “I've got hospitalitis,” she had confided to her husband earlier. “I'm nervous because it's an operation, and I'm ashamed because three of my closest friends are going through menopause. It seems so stupid to be pregnant at my age.” “I don't think I'm selfish not to want a baby at my age,” she said thoughtfully. “I just don't think I could cope, especially after going through all of the worrying about Eric. I don't think I could take worrying that the baby might not be all right.” Interruptions in Sleep Throughout the night, Mrs. Smith slept fitfully, both because of her surroundings and the numerous interruptions for tests, temperature‐taking, blood pressure and other hospital procedures. Missing breakfast, she said, was no great sacrifice since she isn't too keen on hospital food, but she was anxious to have the operation over as soon as possible. Although she had been fitted for a diaphragm after Eric's birth, she hadn't bothered with it in recent years, she said, in answer to her doctor's question, and didn't want to think about contraceptive devices at this time. “Let's get this over with first,” she said, as a nurse efficiently removed the colorless nail polish from her fingers and toes and swiftly covered her wedding ring with adhesive tape. Asked to remove her watch and any other jewelry and be sure that her purse was put away safely, she was checked for false teeth (“only caps; if they come out, I'll sue the dentist”), given mild sedation, put on a wheeled stretcher and sent up to the operating room shortly before 10 A.M. for a suction curetage, a method used for abortion in early pregnancy (up to 12 weeks) in which the cervix is dilated and the uterus evacuated by means of a suction device. Put to sleep before the operation by an anesthesiologist, Mrs. Smith had no way of knowing that the procedure itself took less than 10 minutes. Most of two hours she spent out of her room was spent waiting for the operating room to be made available and, later, coming to in the recovery room. Glad It Was Over By 12:30 P.M., Mrs. Smith was back in her room, with her husband by her side, still feeling a little woozy (“I don't think I'll‐make the dance tonight”) but glad to have the operation over with. Feeling stronger, after a light lunch, Mrs. Smith got up, dressed, said she felt better than she thought she would and marched down the hall to check out. The time was 3 P.M. That night, Mrs. Smith cooked dinner for her family as usual despite her husband's objections. The tab: $750, a fee which was replaced, as of yesterday, at Flower Fifth by a flat rate of $350 for a suction abortion or $500 for “salting out,” a more complex procedure used in more advanced pregnancies, according to Dr. Martin Stone, head of the hospital's department of obstetrics and gynecology. The $750 breaks down into $350 for the hospital, which includes room, laboratory tests, operating room fees; $250 for the attending physician (fees range from $250 to $300 on the average); and $120 for the anesthesiologist. Nine other women—five of them married — received therapeutic abortions at Flower & Fifth Avenue Hospitals, the same day Mrs. Smith did. Among them were a concert pianist, who did not wish to be distracted from her career; a laboratory technician, who had become involved with a married man; three housewives, two with children, one with none; an unmarried bookkeeper who did not wish to marry the father; a Polish woman visiting the city on vacation and two adolescent girls. Most of the women had not used contraceptive devices; an exception was a housewife with two children whose intra‐uterine device had failed to stay in place.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
News Summary and Index,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/03/archives/news-summary-and-index-the-major-events-of-the-day-international.html,"International Britain's new Conservative Government, speaking according to tradition through the voice of the sovereign, Queen Elizabeth H, announced yesterday a program that gives tax cuts and labor‐union reform top priority. The speech, before Parliament, emphasized free enterprise, competition and economic growth. [Page 1, Column 8.] Senior Presidential aides said privately that the shaky Middle East situation was far more difficult problem than Vietnam and could more easily lead to a major‐power confrontation. [1:6‐7.] Thai planes were said by informed sources in Bangkok to have joined the Cambodia war by launching air strikes on an arms depot and field installations about five miles from the Thai border. The air raid was apparently designed to deny the Communists the use of weapons abandoned by Cambodian troops who fled to Thailand. [1:6‐7.] Reporting a move that could mean a sig nificant improvement in the relations be tween the Soviet Union and Communist China, diplomats in Moscow said that China has agreed to accept Vladimir I. Stepakov as the new Soviet Ambassador to Peking. [1:5.] A three‐judge civilian court must decide on the legality of the Vietnam war and the con stitutionality of the Uniform Code of Military Justice before a soldier accused of atrocities at Songmy may be tried, Federal Judge Al bert Henderson ruled in Atlanta. [5:1.] English and other languages can be used instead of Greek in services at churches of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America, under a change voted by delegates to the 20th Clergy‐Laity Con gress of the archdiocese. [1:1‐4.] National The Labor Department announced a drop in the unemployment rate in June to 4.7 per cent of the labor force, but officials cautioned against too much optimism because the “un derlying employment situation” was un changed from May, when the rate was 5 per cent. Total employment declined in June, as it did in May and April. [1:1.] A full investigation into the operations, accounts and finances of the Penn Central Transportation Company and its affiliates was announced by the Interstate Commerce Commission. The I C.C., in the first such inquiry in almost 10 years, will try to find out why the railroad had to file for reor ganization under the bankruptcy law. [1:3.] Bidding on a $50‐million satellite project was ordered reopened after the Controller General upheld charges by the losing bidder, Fairchild Hiller Corporation, that the Na tional Aeronautics and Space Administra tion gave preferential treatment to the win ner, the General Electric Company, and al lowed some Fairchild developments to fall into G.E.'s hands. [1:8.] House Speaker John W. McCormack, called as the final witness at the trial of his former chief administrative aide, Dr. Martin Sweig, explained that he was “not an inquiring fel low” and so did not know that friends could have used his office for the benefit of com mercial clients. The Speaker denied that he had asked favors for the clients. [1:2.] A group of draft‐age youths picked by Selective Service officials recommended lowering of the draft “age of vulnerability” from 19 to 18, elimination of student defer ments and appointment of agents to help conscientious objectors prepare their cases. The 109 advisers also recommended an all volunteer force, which would do away with the need for the draft altogether. [1:5.] Metropolitan Citing two questions of ethics, Controller Abraham D. Beame stopped city payments on two contracts with McKinsey Associates, a consulting firm. The firm recently enter tained Jerome Kretchmer, the Environmental Protection Administrator, and his family, and a member of the firm was an unpaid assist ant city budget director when the contracts were awarded.

ABORTIONS RISING IN CITY HOSPITALS,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/03/archives/abortions-rising-in-city-hospitals-but-municipal-centers-are-still.html,"New York City's municipal hospitals reported that they performed 49 abortions yester day, the second day of opera tions under a new state law allowing terminations of preg nancy by choice. This was more than doubt the 24 abortions reported the public system on the fir: day, but still far below planned capacity of 100 a day. A canvass of 15 other hoE pitals in the city voluntary proprietary and state institu tions showed a slight easing in activity, with 78 abortion tallied yesterday, compare with 84 in the same institu tions the day before. The municipal system yester day registered 207 more worn en for future abortions, com pared with 208 the day before for a total of 1,470 registered under the new law thus far. Public Hearing Due Meanwhile, the city's Board of Health set a public hearing for July 15 at 9:30 A.M. at 125 Worth Street. It will consider a proposed article on abortior services for the City Health Code. The proposal, published in The City Record on Wednes day, would permit abortions up through the 12th week of preg nancy to be performed either in hospitals or other facilities, provided the facilities had blood bank, laboratories for X rays and other tests, supervi sion by an obstetrician or sur geon, anesthetic equipment and an operating room and other emergency units. However, a hospital‐affiliat ed abortion service would be allowed to operate without meeting all of the requirements provided travel time to the hospital did not exceed 10 min utes. Abortions beyond the 12th week of pregnancy would have to be performed on an in patient basis. The proposed Health Code article would require that fam ily planning counseling be made available to each patient. Lor ance Hockert, board secretary, said groups wishing to testify at the public hearing should designate a speaker and send 10 copies of his statement to the Board of Health office be fore the hearing. A number of hospitals in the city reported they were booked well ahead for abortions, to capacity. Mount Sinai said it was booked through July, Flower & Fifth Avenue Hospi tals until July 21, the New York University Medical Center and Jamaica for the next two weeks John Alden Settle, executive director of a commercial re ferral service, the Family Plan ning Information Agency of 160 West 86th Street, said its Abortion Counseling, Infor ination and Referral Services Division had been placing 100 to 150 applicants a day in hos pitals, mainly proprietary insti tutions. It started to do this last Tuesday. Free Guidance Available The commercial agency is not to be confused with the Family Planning Information Service of the nonprofit Planned Parenthood of New York City, 300 Park Avenue South. It offers free informa tion and guidance. Mr. Settle said his enter prise, open 24 hours daily, had written to all 150,000 gynecol ogists, obstetricians, psychi atrists and general practition ers in the United States and Canada, explaining its clearing house effort. “A woman who registers with this agency will be guar anteed a hospital bed and an available board certified gy necologist on a specified date,” the letter said. The cost was reported as free for an indigent New York resident and up to $800 or more for a private pa tient, depending on the case and the institution. Yesterday's report of munic ipal hospital abortions covered the following: Harlem Hospital, nine; Bellevue, seven; Morris ania, six; Cumberland and Queens, five each; Coney Island and Metropolitan, four each; Greenpoint, three, and Elmhurst, Lincoln and Sydenham, two each. Voluntary hospital abortion cases yesterday included Beth Israel, 12; New York Hospital, 10; St. Luke's, seven; Flower & Fifth Avenue, six; French, the Lutheran Medical Center and Roosevelt, five each; Presbyter ian, four; Albert Einstein Col lege of Medicine, three, and Jamaica, one. St. Luke's revised its first day report of six abortions on Wednesday to 11. University Hospital said it had performed six abortions Wednesday and had admitted six patients yes terday for operations today. The State University Hospital of Downstate Medical Center reported four abortions yester day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LUTHERANS URGE OPEN MIND ON SEX,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/03/archives/lutherans-urge-open-mind-on-sex-understanding-and-justice-sought.html,"MINNEAPOLIS, July 2—The Lutheran Church in America spoke out today for fair treat ment of homosexuals. The 600 delegates at the eight‐day biennial convention of the church, which has 3.2 million members, took a stand on homosexuality in a state ment adopted by an over whelming voice vote in the con vention's closing moments. It is “essential,” the state ment said, that homosexuals receive “understanding and jus tice” in the church as well as in the community. The convention, which met in the Minneapolis Auditorium also emphasized a belief that individuals wno engaged in homosexual behavior were no more nor less sinners than were heterosexuals. The church's stand was de scribed as follows in a state ment entitled “Sex, Marriage and Family”: “Scientific research has not been able to provide conclusive evidence regarding the causes of homosexuality. Nevertheless, homosexuality is viewed bibli cally as a departure from the heterosexual structure of God's creation. “Persons who engage in homosexual behavior are sin ners only as are all other per sons—alienated from God and neighbor. However, they are often the special and unde serving victims of prejudice and discrimnation in law, law enforcement, cultural mores, and congregational life. In relation to this area of concern, the sexual behavior I of freely consenting adults in private is not an appropriate’ subject for legislation or po lice action. “It is essential to see such persons as entitled to under standing and justice in churchl and community.” Another section of the state ment, which was approved al most unanimously by the con vention, sanctioned interracial ‘marriage. It declared: “Theologically, marriage between persons, without reference to racial and ethnic differences and back grounds, is a witness to the oneness of man under the one God and as such should be’ fully accepted in both church and society.” A section of the report deal ing with marriage pointed out that a marital union can be le gally valid yet not be a “cove nant of fidelity” or a couple's relationship with God and one another, just as it can be a covenant of fidelity and not a legal contract. At the insistence of many delegates, the following sen tence was adopted and added to the statement: “Because the Lutheran Church in America holds that sexual intercourse outside the context of the marriage union is morally wrong, nothing in this statement on sex is to be interpreted as meaning that this church either condones or ap proves premarital or extra marital sexual intercourse.” On abortion, the report de clared: “Persons considering abor tion are encouraged to consult with their physicians and spir itual counselors. This church upholds its pastors and other responsible counselors and per sons who conscientiously make decisions about abortion.” The statement, prepared and submitted to the convention by the denomination's Board of So cial Ministry, was originally called for by the 1964 conven tion.

Hospitals Delay Most. Abortions Until After Holiday Weekend,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/04/archives/hospitals-delay-most-abortions-until-after-holiday-weekend.html,"No abortions were performed yesterday in most city hospitals, elective surgery being postponed until Monday so that surgeons and other members of the hospitals’ staffs could observe the Independence Day holiday. But there were such operations under the new law in one municipal hospital, Sydenham, where three abortions were performed, and in three private hospitals, University, ColumbiaPresbyterian and Park East, which had six, eight and eleven respectively, a total of 28. The city hospitals have performed a total of 76 abortions since the new state law permitting women to have abortions on demand went into effect last Wednesday. The municipal institutions have registered 1,686 applicants for abortions. University Hospital, a voluntary hospital which is a unit of the New York University Medical Center, will begin its weekend outpatient program today for women seeking termination of pregnancies. Fifteen operations are scheduled. The Beth Israel Medical Center will begin a similar program next Saturday, with 15 or 16 operations planned. Both of these programs are intended especially for the convenience of working women. The municipal hospital system is planning to perform 100 abortions a day. The voluntary and proprietary hospitals have individual plans that provide for a total of at least that number. But it will not be known until next week whether the plans will meet the demand, hospital administrators have said. Hospitals usually maintain only minimum staffs on holiday weekends, so no applications were accepted yesterday. A spokesman for the municipal hospital system said that only emergency abortions would be performed today and tomorrow, the same type that would have been performed under the old law. Obstetrician Resigns New York is one of 18 states which have either liberalized or repealed restrictive abortion laws, according to the voluntary agency, Planned Parenthood‐World Population. Some of them provide abortion counseling and referral services such as the one operated by the nonprofit Planned Parenthood of New York City, 300 Park Avenue South, called the Family Planning Information Service. One of the first such services, established soon after California passed its abortion reform law in 1967, is the one operated by Planned Parenthood of Alameda‐San Francisco. Its staff consists of a director, a coordinator, a training director and volunteer counselors. The reform in New York has cost the Yonkers General Hospital its director of obstetrics. Dr. Robert R. Onorato disclosed that he had resigned on Wednesday because he “didn't want a position of responsibility that involved making decisions on abortions.” “I am a Catholic and I don't believe in taking life,” explained Dr. Onorato. The 54‐year‐old physician will remain on the hospital's staff as an attending obstetrician and gynecologist. His right to refuse to perform or arrange abortions is safeguarded in the new abortion law.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WIDE STUDY URGED ON BIRTH CONTROL,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/04/archives/wide-study-urged-on-birth-control-group-at-geneva-stresses-need-to.html,"GENEVA, July 3—A group of scientists, sociologists and theologians recommended today a wide discussion of questions arising from new birth‐control methods in view of what it called the “worldwide need for population control.” They cited, for one thing, the ethical and psychological considerations raised by the growing legal acceptance of abortion as a means of birth control. The recommendation was made at the close of a conference called by the World Council of Churches to explore the impact of technological advances on man and society. More than 100 scientists, churchmen and sociologists attended the six‐day session here at the headquarters of the council, which includes most of the world's Christian churches with the major exception of the Roman Catholic Church. Preparation Is Urged A conference committee that examined the implications of discoveries in the biological sciences urged the council to help prepare mankind for the developments ahead. It might then be possible, the committee said, to avoid having mankind caught unprepared in the same way it was “when physics ushered in the atomic age.” Another committee said all people affected by technological power “should have a say in its development and operation.” It recommended that the council study ways for achieving a “broadening of participation in meaningful decisionmaking “relating to technological power. One conference group said the council should urgently seek new ways of transferring technology from the industrialized nations to the poorer lands and from advanced to backward regions of the same country. ‘Humanizing’ Needed But this committee warned at the same time of the need to study how to control and humanize the “urbanization process.” It called for “more widespread action by the churches and other agencies” in this field. Another committee recommended in its report to the conference that the council take the lead in extending the use of computers into the social and cultural areas. It said it appreciated the “immense difficulties” to be faced when attempting to measure data in these fields for use in computer programs. Nevertheless, the computer was found to be a “powerful new tool” that could help provide better insights into the “consequences of existing pol. icies, institutions and behavioral patterns.” But the committee also warned of the “great potential danger to mankind” of the misuse for malevolent purposes of computer ‐stored information about individuals, organizations and states.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DENVER SUIT SCORES EASED ABORTION LAW,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/04/archives/denver-suit-scores-eased-abortion-law.html,"DENVER, July 3—Six Denver lawyers, one of them the chief sponsor of Colorado's liberalized abortion law, filed suit yesterday in Federal District Court asking that the law be declared unconstitutional. Representing eight physicians and five women as plaintiffs, the lawyers said the law was an unconstitutional infringement on the rights of pregnant women, on the rights of married couples and on the rights of physicians to care for patients “according to the highest standards of modern medical practice and procedure.” The suit said the five women plaintiffs had tried unsuccessfully to have legal abortions performed. The liberalized abortion law, approved in 1967, provides that an abortion may be performed if a woman's physical or mental health is threatened, if the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest or if there is a medical likelihood the baby will be born deformed. Richard Lamm, one of the six lawyers, is a Denver Democrat who led the legislative fight for the law. He said the statute was subject to varying interpretations and that a overwhelming number of women who sought abortions under its provisions were refused.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
More Social Action ls Pledged At Greek Orthodox Convention,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/05/archives/more-social-action-is-pledged-at-greek-orthodox-convention.html,"The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America has ended its weeklong biennial Clergy‐Laity Congress, pledged to ever‐deeper involvement in the areas of social action and liturgical reform. In the closing moments of the congress Friday night the 1,000 delegates voted to establish an office of social concern. They also passed resolutions condemning drug abuse, abortion, racial prejudice, lawlessness and war, and favoring protection of the ecology. A spokesman for the congress said the archdiocese had never before been so deeply involved with social concerns. The meeting was in the Waldorf‐Astoria Hotel. More Autonomy Sought On Thursday the delegates voted overwhelmingly to permit the use in the liturgy of English and other vernacular languages in addition to Greek. Friday night, in action paralleling its entrance into the field of social activism, the Congress asked Archbishop lakovos to ask the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Instanbul to give the Greek church here more autonomy in the solving of local problems. Archbishop Iakovos is the Primate of the Greek Church in the Western Hemisphere. As such, he is the spiritual leader of about 1.8 million churchgoers. Earlier in the week the congress approved the establishment of a council of priests similar to priests’ senates in the Roman Catholic Church. The 23‐member council will aid the Archbishop in decisionmaking on matters SUCTI as liturgy, church polity, education and mission work. Actions Are Listed In pledging “deeper involv ment and Christian activism in the moral and social problems of our time,” the congress took the following actions: ¶Deplored the “tremendous, increase” in the use of marijuana and charged that calls for a relaxation of laws concerning its use only added to the “drug flow.” ¶Called upon Orthodox Chrisd tians to become involved in neighborhood organizations that welcome minorities and to strive for racial harmony. ¶Condemned violence as a’ means of achieving racial harmony and encouraged churchgders to avoid extremists of both the right and the left. ¶Described abortion as an evil “not in harmony with the life of Christ and a rejection of the most elementary and fundamental principles of the faith.” ¶Reaffirmed opposition to all war—""in Southeast Asia, in the Middle East, and wherever it may occur.” ¶Called on churchgoers to, “respect the right of peaceful assembly and the expression of opinion, which is the essence of the freedom we enjoy by virtue of the sacrifices of our maternal and paternal forefathers.” In other actions, the congress deplored the “increase in the spread of pornography.” It also urged all citizens to “harness their intellects and energies to reduce to the absolute minimum the defilement of our environment.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ABORTION DEMAND PREDICTED TO RISE,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/05/archives/abortion-demand-predicted-to-rise-referral-aide-urges-more.html,"The head of a referral service predicted yesterday that the demand for abortions here under the new state law would be “manageable” through July, “tapering off” into August but then become “increasingly unmanageable.” This should be countered by giving more family planning information in schools as well as colleges and by expanding facilities in hospital‐associated clinics for early pregnancies and in hospitals for those over 10 weeks, he added. The forecast was made by John Alden Settle Jr., director of Abortion Counseling, Information and Referral Services, of 160 West 86th Street, who said his agency had arranged for 1,200 to 1,500 women to go to England for abortions in the first half of this year. By mid‐April, he said, the private English hospitals were asking his agency to curtail referrals, and last month they could not take more foreign patients, while the Government's National Health Service was “bursting at the seams.” England, Mr. Settle said, is in the third year of a liberalized abortion law, and Japan, with a 20‐year‐old law, had had similar experience about its third year. The history, he said, indicates a high initial demand with backlog of cases, then declining but thereafter picking up as abortion becomes more socially “permissible and acceptable.” Japan, he said, “began mastering the problem by talking birth control,” as well as “a massive educational campaign” to terminate pregnancies very early. 100 Inquiries Daily With the new state law effective last Wednesday permitting abortions here by agreement between a woman and her physician in the first 24 weeks of pregnancy, Mr. Settle said his agency had averaged 100 to 150 inquiries a day for the first three days of round‐theclock operation. This fell off closer to 100 on yesterday's Fourth of July holiday, he said. About 75 per cent of referrals actually made have gone to proprietary hospitals, as compared to voluntary nonprofit or municipal hospitals, he said. The first holiday weekend under the new law saw University Hospital, part of the New York University Medical Center, begin a Saturday outpatient program for women pregnant less than nine weeks. Fifteen terminations of pregnancy were reported. No Weekend Abortions The municipal and most other hospitals here generally indicated no abortions were scheduled for the holiday weekend, unless emergencies arose. Increased schedules were expected to start next Saturday. Park East, a proprietary hospital, was renovating facilities over the weekend, but Ronald Shaw, consultant‐administrator, said it and its companion, Park West Hospital, had a combined average of 20 abortions a day scheduled this week starting Tuesday. Bronx‐Lebanon Hospital Center reported its Concourse Division down to one abortion yesterday after two on Thursday and two on Friday, while its Fulton Division performed none yesterday after eight Wednesday, six Thursday and two Friday. The information and guidance telephone program operated by Planned Parenthood of New York City was closed for the weekend, but will resume tomorrow. The number is 7774504. A Typical Week The city's Health and Hospitals Corporation said the holiday period and the strike threat against voluntary hospitals, called off at the,, last moment Wednesday, made the first week's experience atypical. In addition, many potential patients and physicians were still considered to be familiarizing themselves with the situation. A higher rate of abortions appeared to have been going on than hitherto realized, using the therapeutic authorizations for the sake of a potential mother's health. Thus, Beth Israel Medical Center said it had been averaging 25 therapeutic abortions week for the last two years. With the new law, it is expanding its capacity by 15 a week by opening a special room on Saturdays, starting next Saturday.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hospital Pay Hike Granted,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/05/archives/hospital-pay-hike-granted.html,"On the very day last week that the state's new abortion law went into effect—a regulation that is expected to further jam the city's already overcrowded hospitals — a strike scheduled by 25,000 nonmedical employes in 34 nonprofit, private hospitals was averted just a few hours before the picket lines were to be set up. The workers won pay rises of 25 to 30 per cent over two years and, among other things, a 12th paid holiday—the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's birthday, Jan. 15. Prior to the settlement, the average pay of service workers was $112 a week; for practical nurses and clerical and social workers, it was $135.

Abortion: New Law Gets Its First Tests,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/05/archives/abortion-new-law-gets-its-first-tests.html,"To those who have hoped and worked for years to make legal, safe abortions more accessible to American women of all socioeconomic and racial groups, New York truly became the Empire State last week. Under its new abortion law, the nation's most liberal one, the decision to have an abortion within the first 24 weeks of pregancy is up to the mother‐to‐be and her physician. Beyond that time, an abortion can be performed legally only if it is necessary to preserve the woman's life. Here in the city, the abortion program got off to a slow and somewhat chaotic start. Nonetheless, in the first three days under the new law, several hundred abortions had been performed in city hospitals (with possibly hundreds more in doctors’ offices). Also, by week's end, several chiefs of obstetrics reported that initial problems were rapidly being ironed out. The 15 general service municipal hospitals here expect to be able to perform at least 30,000 abortions a year, most of them on women who could not otherwise afford a “clean” one. Estimates of the total annual demand for abortions among city women have ranged from 50,000 to 100,000; according to the Department of Hospitals, hospitals in the city should be able to meet such a demand. Plea for Facilities However, many activists in the abortion field, noting that an influx of women from upstate and outside New York could easily swell the demand for abortions to 500,000 a year, have maintained that additional, nonhospital facilities are needed if all women who want abortions are to get them at a reason able fee. (The cost of abortions, incidentally, ranges from nothing for Medicaid patients to as much as $1,000.) In partial answer to this challenge, the city's Board of Health has relaxed the original Health Department guidelines restricting abortions to hospitals. It now permits hospital‐affiliated clinics and specially equipped free‐standing clinics to treat abortion patients. Presumably, abortions could also be done in a physician's office if he equipped it with a blood bank, anesthesia machine, operating room for major surgery, laboratory and qualified medical personnel—at a cost of about $250,000. The activists, among them the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws and the Women's Abortion Project, a women's liberation group, say that such an elaborate facility is not necessary to perform abortions safely during the first 10 or 12 weeks of pregnancy. The more conservative physicians who advised the Health Department on its guidelines point out that, if the state mishandles its abortion law, similar legislation elsewhere may be doomed. They fear that any deaths that may occur among women aborted in ill‐equipped doctors’ offices will jeopardize this and future liberal abortion legislation. Hearing Scheduled The issue is far from settled. The Board of Health has scheduled hearing on its guidelines fo July 15, at which time marry are expected to press for further relaxation of the restrictions. Poor performance by hospitals during the next weeks could strengthen the activists’ argument, especially if many women are waiting three or more weeks to get a hospital appointment for an abortion. As Dr. Christopher Tietze, associate director of the Population Council and an international authority on abortions, pointed out recently, “It is my impression that an abortion in a doctor's office at eight weeks of pregnancy is safer than an abortion in a hospital at 16 weeks.” —JANE E.

Letters to the Editor of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/07/archives/letters-to-the-editor-of-the-times.html,"Preferential Voting To the Editor: The June 23 primary election provided many further ex amples of the inadequacy and basic inconclusiveness of our electoral procedure which per mits a mere plurality to decide the winner, where three or more candidates are running for an office. The 1969 Mayoral Democratic primary, which Procaccino won with only 33 per cent of the vote, spotlighted the problem. But in the June 23 Democratic primary there were thirteen in stances where the winning can didate in a field of three or more failed to win a majority of the vote; the winners’ per centages varied from 49.6 down to 29.9. (The 49.6 was for John J. Rooney in the Fourteenth Congressional District and the 29.9 was for Herman Badillo in the 21st). In eight instances (Ottinger for U.S. Senate, Badillo and Rangel for Congress and De Salvio, Miller, Nine, Stella and Ferris for Assembly from New York City) the percentage was under 40—a figure that The Times seemed to consider a sufficient proportion, but which can mean that nearly 60 per cent of the voters are opposed to the winner. Runoff elections, with only the two highest candidates par ticipating, could indicate which one had the majority support. They are better than nothing but they involve delay, much expense and the likelihood of a reduced number of voters. A definite conclusive indica tion of the majority opinion can be obtained at the first election by use of the preferential bal lot. Under this method the vot ing simply consists of indicat ing choices, to the extent de sired by each voter, by marking one for first choice, two for second, and so on. In the counting, the man with the fewest first choices is dropped and his supporters’ second choices are transferred to the candidate indicated there by. This process is contin ued, until one candidate ob tains a majority, or until all marked choices are exhausted. Electronic methods can be de vised to facilitate and mecha nize the process. HAROLD M. OLMSTED Jamaica, N. Y., June 29, 1970 Use of Consultants To the Editor: Martin Tolchln's news article (July 1) on the increase in city contracts for consulting services raises some interesting ques tions about the use of consult ing organizations. Consultants often bring to bear on problems a greater range of experience and a more open intellectual attitude. Their perspective is relatively unen cumbered by the sense of past failure which characterizes the civil service. Their freedom from existing jurisdictional ar rangements improves their problem‐solving capability. On the other side of the coin, they lack some of the detailed knowledge of situa tions which is essential to de velop practical solutions. They spend much of their time re inventing the wheel. Effective executive management requires the blending of efforts of con sultants with the work of regu lar staffs. Either group left to itself is unlikely to produce the most useful results. The complexity of this proc ess makes public bidding for consulting services undesirable. Greater publicity about these contracts would, however, be desirable. The present administration deserves credit for expanding urban analysis activities and for its. efforts at building up more sophisticated analytical resources. David Grossman is, however, unfair when he as serts that there was little urban analysis done during the Wag ner administration. The former Mayor stimulated urban analy sis in community renewal, per onnel management, health, youth services, and in other areas. In the buildup of recent ef forts, the local universities have been neglected. Some of the arguments raised by Peter Szanton of the Rand Corpora tion are valid. The “publication” need of university faculty often conflicts with the agency need to maintain some confidential ity. Furthermore, faculty tend to work on a different time frame than agency people, and are often unwilling to accept the scope of a problem as defined by agency staff. Yet there are tremendous benefits in involving faculty, other university ‐based staff, and students in municipal anal ysis activities. It is beneficial both to the intellectual process in the university and to the educational process. It may provide more responsible analy sis than sometimes comes from private consultants and it pro vides opportunities for involv ing, capable and purposeful stu dents in municipal government. The potential benefits are great enough to warrant struggling with some of the problems. The current administration, despite some fanfare, has done mighty little to involve or en courage the local universities in urban analysis in a signifi cant way. HENRY COHEN Director, Center for New York City Affairs, New School for Social Research New York, July 1, 1970 Abortion Issue To the Editor: The Times's editorial indigna tion (June 26) at the treatment accorded pro‐abortion legisla tors during recent primary cam paigns was misdirected. It might better have been exer cised over the thousands of hu man lives that will be “legally” destroyed with the consent of your heroes. When lawmakers oppose the basic beliefs of a large segment of their constituents, they should anticipate elective oppo sition that is not entirely calm and unemotional. Public acqui escence toward abortion on de mand can only vindicate the jeremiad of the radical left, that America is not worth saving. WILLIAM P. KEAVENEY Pompton Plains, N. J. June 28, 1970 Soviet Anti‐Semitism To the Editor: A fundamental misconception underlies C. L. Sulzberger's July 1 Foreign Affairs column on Soviet Jewry. It is the assump tion that “the regime itself is not committed to internal anti Semitism” and that “real anti Semitism is concentrated among relatively few bigots.” But in view of the totalitarian control of printed publications in the Soviet Union, the Gov ernment's publication in hun dreds of thousands of copies of two anti‐Semitic novels by Ivan Shevtsov, one of which was published by the Ministry of Defense—a fact to which Mr. Sulzberger alludes — cannot be accidental or attributable to an isolated bigot. Nor is the publication of vicious Streicher‐like carica tures throughout the central press. It is part of the same policy that produces openly anti‐Jewish books and tracts by notorious anti ‐Semites like Kichko, Ivanov, Mayatslry and many others. If the Government were not in favor of such pub lications they would not be published. The heart of the matter is that anti‐Semitism is endemic not only to the grass roots but to the policy of the regime as such. It is from this that the oppression springs, with all the manifold and wide‐ranging dis crimination, disabilities and deprivations in culture, religion, community, educational and public life. That oppression has now taken a turn for the worse in the recent arrests of eight Leningrad Jews who had signed petitions requesting the right to leave the U.S.S.R. for Israel. HANS J. MORGENTHAU Chairman Academic Committee on Soviet Jewry New York, July 2. 1970 Hard‐Hats’ Fanaticism To the Editor: I was dismayed to read a recent report of a commenda tion plaque and letter sent by some men of Special Forces to the Construction Workers of America. As free men they may speak for themselves. But it is pre sumptuous of them to state that the violence perpetrated by the hard‐hats “lifted the morale of all men serving the United States Armed Forces.” I also serve with Special Forces in Vietnam. I found the actions of the construction workers a disgusting reflec tion of the same violence, hate and lack of tolerance shown by those they demonstrated against. Later reports of construction workers in St. Louis attacking an unarmed woman and a man carrying on his private property a sign reading “Veteran for Peace” further showed the fla grant idiocy and emotional irre sponsibility of these men. Whether a mob is filled with college students or construction men it is still a mob and will behave like one. Many of the men fighting here in Vietnam do so valiantly. Yet they plan to return home to work for peace and for an end to the absurd political machinations that keep this war going. Will they too be set upon by these construction workers as the reward for their service? Violence begets anarchy. The construction workers, as much as any political radical, were promoting revolution. In that sense, the hard‐hats who com mit violence and spread a disregard for personal rights are as fanatical as any bomb thrower. STEPHEN L. JOHNSON 5th Special Forces Group Nha Trang; Vietnam June 20, 1970 President's Rights To the Editor: When questioned during a television interview on July 1 as to whether there is any le gal justification for continuing to fight an undeclared war in Vietnam now that the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution is dead, President Nixon replied in the affirmative, citing his “consti tutional rights—not only the right but the responsibility —to use his powers to protect American forces when they are engaged in military actions.” With perhaps uncharitable skepticism, I proceeded to ob tain a copy of the Constitution of the United States of Amer ica and to read it carefully. There is nowhere the slightest mention of such a Presidential right or responsibility. Mr. Nixon has apparently appended to that venerable document an apocrypha of his own. MARTHA JANE MOUNT New York, July 2, 1970 Free Speech Issues To the Editor: In his June. 16 letter George Brockway suggests that we “require all TV and radio political programs to be at least fifteen minutes....” He correctly points out that this would lead to a decline in the influence of the irrational mes sages produced by advertising agencies. He ignores the rather im portant fact that this proposal is a blatant violation of the First Amendment, which states that “Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech....” If a candidate wishes to spend only one min ute making his case, that is his right. This proposal Is another symptom of the increasing dis respect for the principle of free speech. Many Americans seem eager to deny First Amendment protection to the vociferous opponents of the Vietnam war. Even the Congress of the United States, with the passage of curbs on cigarette advertising, has endorsed the outrageous principle that if you dislike what a man is saying, you have the right to prevent his saying it. The widespread acceptance of this idea is a greater menace to American freedom than all the missiles in Russia. JAMES M.

Standard Diet for Premature Babies Is Questioned,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/08/archives/standard-diet-for-premature-babies-is-questioned.html,"A new study has raised the question of whether premature babies receive adequate nour ishment from standard for mulas. Cow's milk and prepared it fant formulas are low in a cer tarn critical nutrient that, ac cording to the study, prema ture infants cannot manufac ture for themselves. The nutrient is the amine acid cystine, an essential build ing block of protein. The studs reported in the current issue of the journal Science, shower that before full term, the hu man infant is unable to con vert the elements of his norma diet into cystine and thus “may require a diet supplementer with cystine.” The study was made by Dr John A. Sturman, a biochemist and Dr. Gerald Gaull, a pedia trician, both of the New York State Institute for Basic Re search in Mental Retardation on Staten Island, in collabora tion with Dr. Neils C. R. Raiha, a pediatrician at Helsinki Uni versity Central Hospital in Fin land. Human Milk Different In an interview yesterday, Dr. Gaull said that unlike cow's milk, human milk was high in cystine content, suggesting that nature always “knew” what sci ence had just discovered. This is another good reason for giving the baby breast milk rather than formulas, he added. He also said that the finding might be one of the reasons premature infants tended to de velop less well than babies born at full term, since normal de velopment depended on the ability to manufacture proteins properly. In studies made since the preparation of their report, the scientists found that during pregnancy the cystine content of a woman's blood is very low. indicating that the developing fetus may be “scavenging” all it can get, Dr. Gaull said. “This, in turn,” he said, ""brings up the question of the liet of the mother during preg naney, with regard to both the rind and the amount of protein the eats. Maybe in some cir cumstances we have to supple neat her diet with cystine, too.” Most meat proteins contain a goodly amount of cystine. Vege able proteins, on the other Land, are not especially high in ystine, and gelatin has almost Lone of this amino acid. The scientists' initial study ovolved a biochemical an lysis of the tissues of 24 fuses obtained at therapeutic bortion and of three pre lature infants and one normal full‐term infant who died shortly after birth. The study was made at Hel sinki Hospital, where fetal tissues are readily available, land was financed by grants from the Lalor Foundation of ‘Wilmington, Del., and the As sociation for the Aid to Crippled Children. Dr. Gaull said that this was just one of many important studies of normal and ab normal human development that could be made by using tissues obtained at abortion. In their study, the scientists looked for the presence of the i enzyme cystathionase, which is necessary for the manufac ture of cystine from other foodstuffs. They found no trace of this enzyme in either the tissues of the aborted fetuses or the premature babies. Nor did they find any in the placenta. The full‐term infant, how ever, contained a “small but measurable amount” of the enzyme, the scientists found, indicating that “in the develop ing human, cystathionase ac tivity does not appear until after birth.” In the adult human, this en zyme is present in considerable I amounts, and with its aid adults convert most of the amino acid methionine into cystine.

Letters to the Editor of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/08/archives/letters-to-the-editor-of-the-times.html,"To the Editor: I am a New York City fire man, working in the South Bronx. I have just returned from an alarm in my area. As we were leaving the building to return to our ap paratus, a group of children gathered across the street and started chanting. They were young—from seven to ten years old, and at the beginning their chant was inaudible. Fif teen voices, at first disjointed, but then finding harmony filled the street with a song, “Pig, whitey, pig.” I was surprised, then angered, then completely perplexed. In my years in the South Bronx I have heard simi lar phrases before, but these kids were so young. What is it in their experi ences which motivates them to begin so naturally such an ugly phrase? There was no discern able hatred in their faces. It just seemed the appropriate thing for them to do. I do not think these children were malicious. In fact, if they are guilty of anything it is bad manners. But the kids were ob viously propagandized. That is what disturbs me, and should disturb all reasonable people. There is no direction or focus in this kind of platitude—only words internalized by kids to be used on all occasions when dealing with white people. As a fireman I am not any less dedicated to my service, or to the people I serve, because of bad words hurled at me. However., I have a fireman's concern for the future. Will those kids let me put their fires out ten years from now? I think this is a ques tion psychologists and sociolo gists better start asking them selves. DENNIS SMITH New York, July 2, 1970 Unit Pricing Reaction To the Editor: The most cheering news item of the month was the June 30 story of consumers’ reactions to unit pricing of grocery items, which permits instant compari son of relative costs of different brands and sizes. Reactions like “Who would ever take the trouble to go through that?” and “No housewife has the time” are the best possible proof that we are affluent, and in no fear of recession. If consumers cannot be both ered to watch out for their own money, sellers can hardly be blamed for exploiting this indif ference. The original justifica tion for teaching females arith metic was to save them from being cheated by greengrocers and dry goods merchants. Ap parently that hasn't worked too well. But if we really are in for bad times, shoppers will suddenly become very sharp at figures, even without unit price charts. THOMAS T. SEMON New York, June 30, 1970 Hospital Abortions To the Editor: I am moved by your recent editorial critical of the New York City Department of Health guidelines restricting abortions to hospital facilities, to present once more the position of the Obstetric Advisory Committee of the City Health Department —a group of distinguished gynecologists and medical ed ucators. There should be no problem for the “poor and near‐poor” for they are local women who can be readily cared for in our hospital facilities, especially since most can be done on an out‐patient ambulatory basis. With respect to “humane” treatment, we must presume you include safety for the health and well‐being of these women, proper anesthesia for their com fort and respect for their pri vacy. In this model year, at a time when modern technical proce dures for abortion are not yet practiced by most physicians, we cannot agree that the super market or free‐standing clinic approach will meet the usual supervised hospital standards. Surely you are misinformed when you equate abortion with dental procedures. Does anyone want to perform an appendec tomy outside a hospital? While abortion can be made safe with proper examination and laboratory control, it is not innocuous. These patients should be offered the same safeguards offered others re quiring medical care. Abortion is not properly contraception which can be thought of as clinic or office procedure. These considerations led to the unanimous conclusion by the Obstetric Advisory Com mittee of the City Health De partment that a hospital set ting was appropriate. As chair man of this committee I am writing to explain and endorse this view. S. B. GUSBERG, M.D. Professor and Chairman of Obstetrics and Gynecology Mt. Sinai School of Medicine New York, June 25, 1970 Ian Paisley's Views To the Editor: Your June 20 editorial “The Tories Win” in which you ad monish the new British Prime Minister to put Enoch Powell in his place and repudiate his racial policies, is a clear exam ple of how you escaped the in escapable and didn't see the Rev. Ian Paisley as Mr. Powell's counterpart for Northern Ire land. Mr. Paisley's stand for big otry, and his archaic homilies place him in the same horren dous class. It is a misfortune for the Irish people that part of their country is de facto linked with Britain, and therefore involved in British politics. Mr. Paisley's activities as a conservative Unionist deserves the disappro bation of Mr. Heath that you suggest should be the lot of Mr. Powell, and for the same reasons. J. F. BRANIGAN Staten Island, N. Y. June 21, 1970 Chile's Civil Liberties To the Editor: In a letter published by The Times June 24, Domingo Santa Maria, Chilean Ambassador to the United States, asserted that I was unfair in having included Chile in a news article (June 9) about the weaknesses of democracy in Latin America. He took particular exception to my observations about the Chilean judicial system and my statement that “it is possible to spend years in jail without coming to trial,” in Chile. Earlier this year I was per mitted an interview with Henry J. Kuzen, an inmate at a Santi ago prison. Mr. Kuzen, a United States citizen and the former captain of a fishing boat, was arrested by Chilean authorities on Sept. 22, 1967, charged with having signed several checks lacking funds in the bank. At the time I saw him, Mr. Kuzen had been a prisoner nearly two and a half years without trial (or immediate prospect of trial) and may still be there. I was assured at the prison and by Chilean authori ties that Mr. Kuzen's case was by no means unique. Chilean judicial deficiencies inconsistent with the Anglo Saxon legal tradition (and, hence, with American concepts of democracy) were discussed at length in a series of articles published last February by El Mercurio, Santiago's leading newspaper. I would refer Am bassador Santa Maria to the case histories therein. The ambassador suggests that it is beyond the realm of credibility that there could be political prisoners in Chile. The most spectacular ex ample to the contrary that comes to mind is the imprison ment two years ago of Senator Carlos Altamirano, member of the Chilean Senate. Senator Altamirano served sixty days in jail after being convicted of having insulted the Chilean armed forces. The charge stemmed from a speech, in which he had said that the alle giance of the armed forces to President Frei was directly re lated to their pay scales. (Subsequent events, notably the abortive revolt of the Army's Tacna garrison last Oc tober, appear to have at least partly born out Senator Alta mirano's contention.) Unquestionably Chile is one of the most free nations in the hemisphere. But to infer there from that Chile is altogether free of the anti‐democratic forces plaguing other Latin American nations seems to me inaccurate. MALCOLM F. BROWNE Buenos Aires Correspondent The New York Times Buenos Aires, July 1, 1970 U.N.'sMideast Presence To the Editor: The positioning of a United Nations peace‐keeping force on both banks of the Suez Canal might reduce the volatibility of the Israeli‐Egyptian conflict. The two most significant con ditions are that the U.N. force be stationed with the under standing that it can be removed only by the consent of the Is raelis and the Egyptians (or by a unanimous vote of the Secu rity Council), and that its task be recognized as enforcing cease‐fire, not guarding an in ternational border. The first condition is needed because of the experience of the U.N. force posted at the Gaza Strip. The force remained there from 1957 to 1967 but was removed on short notice at the unilateral request of President Nasser. Actually, the force did sur prisingly well in turning the Gaza Strip border into one of the most peaceful Israeli fron tiers throughout ten years. A U.N. force on the Suez banks, which could be a natural expansion of the U.N. observer force now positioned there, would have to be accept able to both sides and bound to stay there as long as either felt it was needed. The Egyp tians would, of course, refuse to accept such a U.N. force if they felt it implied a conces sion regarding the future of the Sinai. But clearly no such im plication would be entailed. Value of Force A U.N. force would stop the losses inflicted on Israel by Egypt's artillery war of attri tion, since the U.N. units would be in the firing line. Israel, hence, would not need to bomb the Suez area. (Other Israeli bombings of Egypt have been stopped as of April 1970.) While the Egyptians and the Russians would surely use the U.N. shield to erect Sam‐3's be hind it, thus possibly closing the most direct route for Is raeli aircraft into Egypt in case of a future war, this may be an acceptable cost to Israel in view of another gain: the U.N. men would provide a barrier against major Egyptian landings across the canal which might be completed with Soviet air cover and advisers. The Soviet Union's tactical goals are said to be limited to shoring up Egyptian defenses and opening up the Suez Canal. The canal could be opened within the lines of the U.N. force, but it would have to be opened to all countries. This would have to be part of the initial understanding regarding the introduction of the force on both banks of the canal. This condition Is one the Egyptians and the U.S.S.R. may find almost impossible to ac cept. Only the fear that with out such action their limited goals could not be achieved—at least not without risking a major Soviet‐Israeli confronta tion, with its world war impli cations — might induce the Russians to lead Egypt to ac cept the true opening of the Suez. In the Middle East de‐escala tions are hard to come by. But in view of the fact that the sides involved have agreed to the positioning of a U.N. ob server force, it might be pos sible to gradually increase it, until it is able to take over the Suez cease‐fire lines, thus dis engaging the sides. AMITA1 ETZIONI New York, June 30, 1970  Data on Citizens To the Editor: From the momentum already apparent in the programs which compile and store information on suspect individuals (news story, June 28) it is probably impossible to reverse the proc ess. But it could be slowed and its horror perhaps mitigated if any citizen had the legal right, on demand, to full disclosure of all information pertaining to him. I. HERBERT SCHEINBERG, M.D. Bronx, July 1, 1970 MAROONED There is a distance in our lives that boats and footsteps cannot cross; we sat together on the stairs and yet our thoughts were seas apart.

"Goldberg, in Campaign Upstate, rinds Abortion Is Still Big Issue",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/10/archives/goldberg-in-campaigh-upstate-finds-abortion-is-still-big-issue.html,"UTICA, N.Y., July 9—Arthur Goldberg discovered today that although the most liberal abortion law in the nation wen into effect in New York State on July 1, the issue of abor tion can still be explosive. Mr. Goldberg, the Democraft Liberal candidate for Gover nor told an audience at the Senior Day Center here that he favored liberal abortion laws because “family life ought to be regulated by the family.” An elderly woman in the audience called out to him: “Don't you realize it!s murder? If I had aborted just one of my 10 children, it would still have been murder.” Mayor Richard Assaro, who sat beside Mr. Goldberg, pointed to a Roman Catholic nun in the audience. Her left eye Was blackened and she had ad hesive bandages on her cheek. She was beaten up in an argu ment over abortion‐just last Week in the city, the Mayor said. Similar Incidents The abortion issue contributed to primary defeats of two central New York legisla tors — Assemblyman George Michaels, a Democrat, and State Senator D. Clinton Dominick, a Republican. Other upstate lawmakers had near misses, As semblyman Maryann Krupsak of nearby Amsterdam, and many other, are treating the subject cautiously. Incidents similar to that ex perienced by Mr. Goldberg here today, when the candidate dis cussed issues with 50 elderly people, occurred at other meet ings with community groups at the Y.M.C.A. and at Utica Col lege, a branch of Syracuse Uni versity. The candidate, who rates highest in personality polling on “integrity,” has abandoned what he calls “hit‐and‐run cam paigning” for the “talk session’ or dialogue in which he and his audience exchange ideas. His contributions today included: ¶Social Security payments should be increased “by at least 50 per cent.” ¶As Governor he would de mand “an early scientific an swer” on whether marijuana use leads to addiction to hard drugs. ¶An original advocate of cen tralized government, he now would favor decentralization and “going backward and re storing a lot of vitality to the states.” Ms. Goldberg, who has ac companied her husband on this two‐day upstate swing, is cam paigning on her own, visiting with community groups and in specting local hospitals and other social facilities. In one of Mr. Goldberg's ses sions was a question labeled “personal,” from a man in one of the audiences. Noting that Mr. Goldberg had held many illustrious positions during his career, the man asked: “Tell me, why can't you hold a steady job?”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2 Top Orthodox Rabbis Score ‘Blanket’ Abortion Permission,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/11/archives/2-top-orthodox-rabbis-score-blanket-abortion-permission.html,"The two top leaders of Orthodox Judaism in this country issued a joint statement yesterday condemning “indiscriminate and blanket” abortions. The leaders were Rabbi Joseph Karasick, president of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, and Rabbi Bernard L. Berzon, president of the Rabbinical Council of America. The rabbis emphasized that their comments were aimed specifically at the medical profession and women about to take advantage of the state's new permissive legislation. State law, the most liberal in the nation, now leaves the decision to have an abortion within the first 24 weeks of pregnancy up to the woman and her physician. Beyond that time an abortion can be performed legally only if it is necessary to preserve the woman's life. The joint statement declared that no woman was the “final arbiter about the disposition of her body and the embryonic human life flourishing therein.” “Doctors, too,” the statement insisted, “must face up to the moral dilemma: whether they can play havoc with the basic worth and dignity of human life when they freely perform abortions. “In Judaism, the life of an unborn child is sacred and only when It is a threat to the mother can the moral issue of abortion be resolved. For each person to decide arbitrarily, on the basis of economics or convenience, whether a fetus is to survive is literally for man to play God and is religiously blasphemous and socially destructive.” In an interview, Rabbi Karasick declared that to destroy human embryo Is “sacrilegious interference with life itself and akin to murder.” “Only when there is actual and acute danger to the life of the mother does Jewish religious law permit termination of pregnancy,” he said. According th the rabbi, the Talmud asserts that “whoso sheds the blood of man within man his blood shall be shed.” This has been traditionally interpreted as constituting a commandment against the killing of unborn children, Rabbi Karasick noted. Rabbi Bernard Twersky, information director for the Rabbinical Council, said the joint statement was the first public expression of opinion on the new state law by a major Jewish body. The Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches have always opposed abortion. Protestantism, in general, has been less restrictive. Catholics Warned LOS ANGELES, July 10 (AP) —The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Los Angeles says he will excommunicate any member of the church in his jurisdiction who becomes involved in abortion. “Thou shalt not kill Is the unchangeable law of God,” Archbishop Timothy Manning declared yesterday. “Loudly and clearly our voices must guard the religious convictions of every doctor, nurse, social worker, employe of any medical or social welfare group agency. They must not be pressured to assist in abortion practices, nor may they advise, counsel or pressure welfare recipients toward the procurement of an abortion.” The Los Angeles Diocese has 1.7 million members. Under California law, aborton is permitted in cases of rape, and incest, and to preserve f,the mother's physical or mental health.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Policy Rates Rising for Malpractice,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/12/archives/policy-rates-rising-for-malpractice.html,"The rates that physicians pay for malpractice insurance are rising sharply around the coun try, sometimes doubling in cost. A 65 per cent increase will go into effect for doctors practic ing in New York on Sept. 1.  The Medical Society of the State of New York, largest in the nation with a membership of 27,000, reported that the new increase followed a 55 per cent rise in malpractice rates last year. Even with that increase, the insurer, Employers Insurance of Wausau, Wis., said it had lost money on the New York doc tors covered. In reporting the increase to society members, Dr. Arthur J. Mannix Jr. of New Rochelle, chairman of the society's professional medical liability and defense board, said: “The malpractice claims tide continues to rise, not just in New York but across the coun try.” Asked if widespread use of the birth control pill or legaliza tion of abortion, which went into effect in New York July under the nation's most liberal Oabortion policy, had anything to do with the increase, Frank Appleton, the society's indem nity representative, answered: “Long range, probably yes, in that any new medical pro cedures mean additional expo sure—ranging from operations to correct baldness to abortion. Malpractice insurance rates recently doubled in Vermont and Michigan. In Ohio, they in creased 75 per cent; in Phila delphia, 250 per cent. In California a 95 per cent increase went into effect Oct. 1, 1968, to be followed by 110 per cent increase the fol lowing year. “The steadily worsening ex perience is only partly a mat ter of proliferation of claims,” Dr. Mannix explained in a re port in the society's journal. “Far more serious is the boost in value attached to the average case,” he said “Awards approaching or ex ceeding the million‐dollar level are no longer rare. “And each well‐publicized recovery proportionately en hances the settlement value of thousands of outstanding cases.” According to one Federal study, the ironic thing about malpractice awards is that only about 30 per cent of the money paid out by the insurance com pany goes to the patient, with the remainder going to attor neys.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
‘10‐Year Legislature’,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/13/archives/10year-legislature-both-major-parties-looking-forward-to.html,"“This will be a 10‐year Legis lature,” said Stanley Steingut, the Democratic leader of the State Assembly, as he talked about the November election of 150 Assemblymen and 57 State Senators. “We're trying to make voters understand that the Legislature means more to their everyday life than the Presidency — and that the parties that control the Legislature next year will probably control the state for 10 years.” New Analysis What Mr. Steingut was talk ing about—and what many political professionals are spending most of their time worrying about—is that the legislators elected this year will have the power to reappor tion their own districts and the state's Congressional districts to conform to the population changes that will be reported in the 1970 census. Because gerrymandering—the fine art of drawing districts to favor one party—is part of New York's political tradition, both Democrats and Republicans are involved in hectic but largely unpublicized efforts to win majorities in both the Assembly and Senate. The Republicans start with two advantages: They have more incumbents running be cause they now control both houses‐79 to 71 in the Assem bly and 33 to 24 in the Senate— and the present Senate districts, carefully drawn by past Re publican majorities, were de signed to create numerous “safe” districts with a majority of enrolled Republican voters. But, for the first time the Democrats have established a statewide organization to co ordinate their legislative cam paigns. The Democratic Legis lative Campaign Fund, with a projected budget of $250,000, is working In 29 Assembly dis tricts and nine Senate districts where computer analyses and politicians' instincts have in dicated that Republican incum bents could be retired this year. The campaign fund will pro vide personnel and literature to help Democratic candidates in those districts, but a major part of the party effort will be the production of a 30‐minute tele vision documentary describing the legislative process and attacking the record of Re publican legislators. The film — which will be used as a paid television com mercial in key districts — is being produced to try to persuade more voters to vote in legislative contests. Past voting records show that from 15 to 25 per cent of the peo ple who vote for candidates for Governor do not bother to vote for Assembly and Senate candidates—and the Democra tic leadership is convinced that 75 per cent of those “fall off” voters are democrats. The Republicans have had an active and effective Assembly Campaign Committee and Sen ate Campaign Committe for many years. Financed with grants of about $100,000 each from the Republican State Committee, the G.O.P. commit ees provide campaign litera ture, hold seminars for their candidates on campaigning techniques and, most impor tantly, contribute up to $5,000 to candidates in marginal dis xicts. 2 Examples Explained Where will the Democratic and Republican money be spent? The men responsible for iistributing it — Assembly Speaker Perry B. Duryea Jr. and Senate Majority Leader Earl W. Brydges for the Re publicans: Mr. Steingut and Senate Minority Leader Joseph Zaretzki for the Democrats— are somewhat secretive about their plans, because they would like to keep them from the other side. But there are sev eral districts that could obvi ously swing either way in November. Two examples are: The 122d Assembly District in Binghamton. Republicans will concentrate on this district because the Democratic incum bent, George M. Michaels, lost his party's primary after cast ing the deciding vote that passed the state's new abortion law. Mr. Michaels, who will be on the November ballot as the Liberal party's candidate, had been consistently winning in a district with a substantial majority of enrolled Republi cans, and the G.O.P. thinks it can now win his seat. The 12th Senate District in Queens. Democrats will con centrate on this district, rep resented by Martin J. Knorr, Republican‐Conservative, be cause they have a popular and well‐known candidate in a for mer City Council President, Francis X. Smith. Control of the Legislature, of course, is also critical to the candidates for Governor. The programs that will be advo cated in the next five months by Governor Rockefeller and Arthur J. Goldberg, the Demo cratic candidate, will probably never become laws if the nex Governor cannot work with a Legislature controlled by his own party. For that reason, the travel schedules of the guber natorial candidates will be one indicator of which legislative races have a high priority in each party. Mr. Rockefeller will have devote some of his time to helping Republicans in close races, and Mr. Goldberg will have to do the same because of the importance of legisla tive control to both parties.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Village Youths Find Friend in Doctor,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/13/archives/village-youths-find-friend-in-doctor-village-youths-find-a-friend.html,"Jofrey Arlen, M.D., does not have an answering service, but he sleeps on a mattress on the floor in the back of his office. His head is usually off the pil low at the first ringing of the doorbell by a patient on a bad trip.  There are no diplomas on Dr. Arlen's walls. What re sembles a diploma is a mock scroll certifying that he is member of the Righteous Freaks of America. There is Beatle music in the waiting room, but no pile of Reader's Digests for his pa tients, who include an Andy Warhol superstar, a Bob Dy lan scholar and a stream of young men and women who straggle in from the surround ing “hippie” neighborhood of the East Village to see the bearded doctor when their problems get too big. This is the form of medicine as it is practiced at St. Mark's Clinic, an informal, six‐month old free medical center run by Dr. Arlen at 44 St. Marks Place in conjunction with St. Mark's in the Bowery Church. Experience on Coast The 26‐year‐old physician, who usually is addressed by patients as Jef, opened the clinic on the basis of his ex perience practicing medicine in Haight‐Ashbury, the hippie col ony in San Francisco. Until last week, the new clinic's future was in doubt, because Dr. Arlen had received notice that he was to be activated by the Army Reserve next month to serve two years of active duty. Some of the young people and local residents who are served by what is called sim ply the Clinic reportedly were planning to surround the place to prevent his departure. Dr. Arlen says he had no intention of reporting anyway, but word came from Senator Charles E. Goodell's office that the doctor had been granted a six‐month postponement to continue his work, the second such delay he had received from military authorities. The news cheered Dr. Arlen, his young blond wife, Deanna, and the others who consider his presence vital, including score of volunteer physicians, nurses and therapists who treat an average of 40 patients there five nights a week. Mrs. Arlen serves as office manager, keeping track along the way of crash pads where the young patients can safely spend the night if, as often hap pens, they are newcomers at tracted to New York by roman tic notions of the drug culture. “We get a lot of drug cases,” Dr. Arlen said, “along with venereal disease. Believe me, gonorrhea is an epidemic down here.” The clinic has been financed privately, mainly by $1,800 month, in aid from the David and Minnie Berk Foundation, philanthropic group that pro vides seed money for offbeat ideas. There was also $7,500 in aid from the New York Founda tion. The financing is not long term, however, and Dr. Arlen is constantly begging for addi tional aid and shopping around for second‐hand equipment. The clinic has four consulta tion rooms equipped in typical fashion with paper‐covered ex amination tables, tables of band ages and tongue depressors, and usually some bright poster about a rock group or pacifist cause. The Arlen's kitchen doubles as a laboratory for minor diag nostic tests. Drug Selling Witnessed Dr. Arlen gets angry at the drug selling he reports witness ing in the streets, and the clinic's attempts to deal with it include limited methadone treatment, group therapy ses sions and as much interview and conversation as doctor and patient can manage in the P. M.‐to‐10 P. M. office hours each day which often slip on to midnight. Young girls are fitted with contraceptive devices quite often at the clinic, or advised to get an abortion, a service Dr. Arlen hopes the clinic itself will offer one day. The typical problems of the East Village runaways must be dealt with gingerly, he says. “We watch out for heroin addiction and pregnancy,” Dr. Arlen declared as he moved through the clinic dressed in shorts, sandals and heads. “If a kid appears to be adjusting well and is not depressed, let him find out what's it all about.” The Arlens, who earn a total salary of $6,000, have helped youngsters find their way home in some cases. One high school senior from a small town in Pennsylvania became pregnant and had an abortion during her fling in the East Village. She returned to school with the Arlens' help and now volun teers at a children's hospital and has a summer job at a turnpike restaurant where slie loccasionally serves some of this year's crop of runaways, advis ing them about the Clinic. “I'm hoping they'll find a kind of giving and caring right along with a loving attitude toward life that I found there.” the girl wrote the Arlens. Dr. Arlen recently branched out, opening a free dental clinic up the block, staffed by volun teers, to treat the neglected teeth of the young strays. The teeth of the youngsters often show special problems. He ob tained four chairs and related equipment from retiring den tists and in the waiting room there is a sign that has one of the Clinic's few rules: “If you're high, you can't stay.” Customs Aide Appointed The Bureau of Customs has announced the appointment of Jack T. Lacy as executive as sistant to Myles J. Ambrose, Commissioner of Customs. Mr. Lacy, who joined the bureau in 1954, most recently had the post of program management lofficer in the bureau's office of operations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Letters to the Editor of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/14/archives/letters-to-the-editor-of-the-times.html,"British Election To the Editor: As an Oxonian at New York, and made most welcome here, may I seek further hospitality in your columns? I have observed the British election through the news media in this country, and have not always recognized what I have seen. It has simply seemed a contest between Twee dledum and Tweedledee, ins and outs, favorites and outsiders. Not so; the effects of this election, domestically and in ternationally, will be far‐reach ing and long‐lasting. The British system is dominated to an extent not always appreciated here by the 630 members of the House of Commons. There is no independent Pres ident or Supreme Cqurt to make or to strike down law. All im portant decisions must be put through Parliament, and what passes Parliament inevitably takes effect. In the new Parliament the Conservatives and their sup porters have a small majority. It is smaller than the combined forces of Ulster Unionists and adherents of Enoch Powell. A House of Commons so consti tuted will not pass the liberal laws on abortion, divorce and homosexuality that have passed the previous House of Com mons with its majority of Labor members. Nor can a Government depend ent upon such support avoid pressure for further reduction of non‐white immigration into Britain, the repression of the minority in Northern Ireland and a fundamental change of Britain's international stance. For evidence, one need look no further than the new Govern ment's program as announced in the Queen's speech, recent events in Belfast and the wel come accorded by the Prime Minister of South Africa. Whatever views one might hold on these issues, the pro found change of principle and approach stemming from the recent election, which will be worked out for years to come, should not be lightly disre garded. COLIN TAPPER Fellow of Magdalen College, Visiting Professor of Law, New York University New York, July 8, 1970 • For Defense Spending To the Editor: Your dispatch (July 10) quoting Defense Secretary Laird to the effect that Soviet mis sile development has “gone for ward with new starts” clashes with your editorial of the same day (“Shifting National Priori ties”). In the editorial you de scribe the American ABM pro gram as being of “dubious merit.” But we may need that “dubious” program in the light of developments in the U.S.S.R. Since late 1965, however, the U.S.S.R. has proclaimed a pol icy of “waging an offensive against the positions of im perialism” and has strengthened (and “enriched”) both its de fensive and offensive war‐mak ing capabilities. In the last five years, the Soviets have been spending almost twice as much in absolute terms as the U. S. on offensive/defensive weap ons systems. They have passed us in total numbers of ICBM's; they have developed, or are developing, some systems which remain on drawing‐boards in the U. S. e.g., Fractional Orbital Bombs and improved long‐range ABM. In contrast to the burgeoning Soviet military build‐up pro gram, our defense effort, ex cept for the expenditures for the war in Vietnam, has re mained almost constant for the past fifteen years, measured in terms of the 1968 dollar. Mean while, our gross national prod uct for the same period has more than doubled. Moreover, while the Soviets concentrate their attention on both defense and offense, we have tended to emphasize offense. But our offensive ICBM's (the Minutemen) will scarcely avail us if Soviet strategy calls for a Soviet pre‐emptive (sur prise) attack. In such an attack, our second‐strike capability (represented by Minuteman, Po laris, and SAC bombers—the “three main pillars”) would be seriously depleted. Soviet Step‐Ups Not only this, but the Sovi ets, beginning at a stepped‐up pace since 1965, have worked assiduously at developing an ABM system which would blunt the effectiveness of our much‐touted second‐strike ca pability. If our retaliatory mis siles were knocked out of the sky as they re‐enter over Soviet targets, how effective would our half of the deterrent equa tion be? Yes, let's end the war or at least our part in it, in South east Asia. But when we start licking our wounds at home, let's not neglect our national defense. The war in Southeast Asia could be only a phase in a pre‐World War III situation, a weapons‐testing and attrition type war into which we were drawn with the cynical ap proval of China and Russia. Once out of this quagmire, how ever, we would be advised to keep our powder dry. ALBERT L. WEEKS New York, July 8, 1970 The writer, Associate Professor at N.Y.U., is the author of “The Other Side of Coexistence: An Analysis of Russian Foreign Policy.” • Moynihan's Slip To the Editor: When Daniel P. Moynihan tells the Urban Coalition that we have become a “noisome” nation, he performs the Freu dian slip of the year. His se mantics may be quite poor, but under the circumstances, who can blame him? ABE GOTTLIEB Harrisburg, Pa., July 2, 1970 • State Campaign Issue  To the Editor: Harry Frank castigates Ar thur Goldberg for asking Gover nor Rockefeller to repudiate President Nixon's policies. [Let ter July 3.] The fact is that New York is an integral part of the United States and is already seriously affected by the President's many actions. When the President expands the war into Southeast Asia, New York boys are killed. When he creates and engineers an economic depression (not a mild recession), every New Yorker is affected. New York citizens have lost many billions of the $250 billion already lost through security price attrition. New York stores and fac tories find their sales shrinking and their existence threatened. New York firms are going out of business. New York citizens who have lost their jobs find themselves forced to go on re lief. New York graduates find “No Help Wanted” signs at every door. As the deterioration sinks deeper, it will affect the very ability of the State of New York and its cities to collect taxes. We had the experience in 1929–32 and can predict the next phases of the bankrupt policies of the Administration. Mr. Goldberg should inten sify his criticism of the tie between Governor Rockefeller and President Nixon. If the Governor objects to the tie‐in, [et him speak forcefully in oppo sition to the President's policy. New York's well‐being is in terwoven with that of our na tion. That is why all the candi dates should speak out loudly, especially so because the future looks dark indeed. SAMUEL C. GREENFIELD New York, July 7, 1970 • Consultants' Standards To the Editor: As president of the Society of Professional Management Consultants. I am writing to voice the shock and dismay of our members throughout the country at the revelations in The Times on July 1 and 3 re garding consulting contracts for New York City. Our society has worked for ten years to raise the level of ethical and profes sional practices among man agement consultants. We are concerned lest the practices and standards reported in your revealing news articles are as cribed to our entire profession. You quote an employe at Mc Kinsey Associates as saying that management consultants “are not oriented toward solving the problems, but toward pleasing the client.” This viewpoint is precisely the one which our so ciety and its code of ethics and its exacting qualification re quirements for new members seek to banish. Similarly, the notion that it is proper for a consultant to act as assistant budget director while contracts for his firm are being processed, or for his firm to provide vacations in the Poconos to prospective clients or to offer $1,000 for a copy of a speech to a prospective client—all of these represent unethical practices that cannot be condoned by professional management consultants. We egret that the opinions and practices of one consulting firm should appear to smear the en Ire profession. No member of the cited firm —which is the largest and has the highest fees of any such or ganization — has applied for membership in our professional society. The Society of Professional Management Consultants, which as members throughout the United States and other coun tries of the world, represents the responsible and profession al consultants who deal with the problems of management of organizations—business, indus trial, governmental, nonprofit, etc.—in their efforts to upgrade and improve the standards of conduct and professional prac tices employed by management consultants everywhere. We wish to assure you that the viewpoints and practices which you reported in connec tion with consulting work for the City of New York do not represent the viewpoints or ethical standards of consultants who are professionals in the field. JAMES A. O'HARA President, Society of. Professional Management Consultants, Inc. New York, July 3, 1970 • For Safer Planes To the Editor: The air tragedy at Toronto again lays bare the critical lack of onboard fail‐safe crash sys tems for commercial aircraft. The NASA experience and ability to slow down a moon capsule speeding at 25,000 miles an hour by means of retro‐rockets and lastly chute systems; to protect crews from heat and fire by heat shields— are all proven. To be adaptable to commer cial aviation they need to be unsealed. With the airlines now operating on average loads of 50 per cent capacity, the room is surely available. Fail‐safe crash systems will do more for aviation than any SST ever planned. Retro ‐ rockets externally mounted on fuselages combined with multiple heavy duty chute systems installed along the top line of the fuselage, with the fuselage itself built as a heat and fire shield, and inflated air bags along the bottom side would have allowed every per son on the Toronto plane to walk away from that plane even though both wings and all the engines had fallen off. The basic airframe fuselage can it self be an integral safety con tainer. This is a worthy mission for NASA and SST program funds. JAMES P. O'SHEA New York, July 8, 1970 • Gifts by Banks To the Editor: It would seem advisable fol the Government to allow banks to pay higher interest rates tc depositors rather than have banks offer give‐away prize$ for new depositors who are after all, old depositors of non give‐away banks.

Homemakers of the Future: Marriage Is Only One Goal,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/14/archives/homemakers-of-the-future-marriage-is-only-one-goal.html,"In junior and senior high schools throughout the coun try, the initials “FHA” do not usually bring to mind the Federal body in Washington that makes loans to prospec tive home owners. Instead, they refer to the Future Homemakers of America, an organization of 600,000 teen age girls who hope someday to be the wives and mothers of America.  But while these girls may want to he homemakers, they also believe that they won't feel fulfilled as women un less they also have careers. That was the consensus of five representative FHA girls from across the nation who got together yesterday, on the first day of the group's national convention in the Hilton Hotel, to talk about what American teen‐age girls are thinking about, talking about, and doing. “We all want to work,” said Luck Hendrix, IS years old, of Metter, Ga., the out going national president of FHA. “Some of us want to work before marriage, and some of us want to work during marriage. Everybody I know seems to think of women as having a dual role of homemaker and wage earner.” Influence Cited Miss Hendrix, an attractive blonde who has two legal names on two birth certifi cates (Betty Lucretia is her other legal name) said she thought the women's libera tion movement had had “definite influence” on the thinking of today's teen‐age girls. “I especially agree that women should have equal pay for equal work,” she said. “But I think that if woman is married, the man should be the head of the household.” The five girls, who are among the 1,500 delegates at tending, also generally agreed that the so‐called sexual rev olution in this country is, in deed, a reality; that abortion should be legalized in all of the states: that while drugs are a serious problem, they may just be a “phase” that all young people think they have to go through, and that the United States should honor its commitments in Vietnam. Nobody's Business “Young people are really free now,” said Brenda Booker, 16, of San Francisco who is her state's FHA song leader. “Most of the girls I know are going bra‐less now. And they were taking the Pill until they learned about the side effects. If they do get pregnant, they no longer think they have to run out and get married. They think that it's nobody's business but their own.” “In my state,” said Cynthia Masukawa, 17, of Hanamaulu, Kauai, Hawaii, “girls who have had babies out of wed lock come back to school to finish their educations. Then they go on to jobs.” Miss Masukawa, who is of Japanese descent, said that when school started last fall, the students in her class be gan talking about drugs, then switched to the war in Viet nam as the year wore on, then to abortion. (In a mock referendum, the class officers voted in favor of Hawaii's new liberalized abortion law.) “And when school ended, we were talking about ecol ogy,” she said, fingering the purple lei around her neck. “We young people are very much against tourism in Hawaii. We see it as a de stroying factor to our natural environment. We would like to see people stop building hotels and taking over the beaches.” Cindy McCracken, 17, of Tuscaloosa, Ala., president of that state's FHA, said that drug use was the major prob lem at her school, Tusca loosa High. She said it was not unusual for her to go into the rest room and find several students smoking marijuana. Room Set Aside “In San Francisco,” Miss Booker said, “five high schools last year set aside a room where students who were loaded [high on drugs] could come in and lie down and come down. While they were coming down, they could discuss any problems they might have with a high school counselor. “But the worst thing.” she said, “is that even kids in grammar school are walking around loaded or smoking pot.” The articulate black girl said she thought racism was the biggest problem in her school, Lowell High School, a secondary school for 2,900 honors students‐120 of them black—in San Francisco. But even so, Miss Booker agreed with Linda Poole, 17, of Wetumka, Okla., who is half white and half Creek Indian, that the Indians are the most oppressed minority in America. “The Bureau of Indian Af fairs is nothing but a dump ing ground for the Presi dent's friends,” Miss Poole said angrily. “It's supposed to be for Indians, but it's run by whites.” Unexpected Views Ironically, the girls, who seemed to espouse the liberal point of view on most issues, tended to favor the Adminis tration's position in regard to Vietnam. “It's our duty to keep Com munism as far away from our shores as we can,” Miss Poole said. “Going into Cambodia was controversial,” Miss Hendrix added, “but in the end, think it was the right thing to do.” On the subject of fashion, all of the girls except Miss McCracken were violently opposed to the midiskirt. “I'll buy one, maybe two, the long‐haired brunette said. “I'm a member of the teen hoard at a local department store, and I've got to be fashion leader.” “I won't buy them,” Miss Booker vowed. “If the stores don't have miniskirts, I'll make some myself.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Colombians Get Aid on Family Planning,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/15/archives/colombians-get-aid-on-family-planning.html,"BOGOTA, Colombia July 4— There is a new billboard at Sev enth Avenue and 22d Street here that subtly advertises a service that until recently was only whispered about in tradi tion ‐ bound Colombia—family planning.  The billboard, the first of many sponsored by an anony mous group of businessmen says simply: “Another child? Think about it in time.” But to the thousands who pass that busy downtown corner here, there is no need to say more. After years of quietly persist ent work by the medical profes sion, social groups and, sur prisingly for this conservative land, many Roman Catholic churchmen, most Colombians now know that they can receive birth‐control advice and help. A relatively large number are availing themselves of both. “Please don't call it birth con trol because we still have many obstacles to overcome,” said Dr. Guillermo López‐Escobar, chief of the population‐studies divi sion of the Association of Co lombian Medical Schools. “We are working, let us say, on the problem solely as a health measure.” Using that approach, Dr. López‐Escobar's group not only has neutralized most of the tra ditional opposition of conserva tive church leaders but also has enlisted their aid in drawing almost 25,000 women into about 340 family‐planning centers each month. Leading Cause of Death “The church realizes that pregnancy‐related illnesses are the leading cause of death among Colombian women in the 15‐to‐44‐year‐age group.” Dr. López‐Escobar explained.. “Many of these deaths result from self‐abortions or poorly attended abortions.” As it is, Colombia's popula tion of about 21.5 million will grow by more than 700.000 in the year ending next July 1. Nearly half the people in this poor country are under 15 years, the physician went on and “no social or economic progress can ever match that rate of growth.” More disturbing to social and economic planners is the continued spillover of rural popu lation into the swollen and poorly serviced urban centers. This capital for example, is ex pected to double in population to five million by 1980. Other large Colombian cities, such as Medillin, Cali and Barranquilla, are expanding at even greater rates because of the traditional movement of younger farm children into urban areas. Dr. López‐Escobar noted that despite important aid from the Ford Foundation and other or ganizations only 1 per cent of the $300‐million in foreign aid and loans received by Colombia each year is earmarked for family planning. Many social workers at the family‐planning center here believe that reflects the lack of profit for lenders and donors in this vital area. Dr. López‐Escobar finds, however, that despite the gains already made, his group's major hurdles are economic, social, political and religious. The big gest gain is that the subject is now spoken about openly. High Cost of Birth Control The economic barrier is in the high price of birth‐control pills and other devices, almost all of which are made of im ported materials. A monthly cycle of pills, for example, costs, about a dollar, or the average daily wage of a common labor er. Because most Colombians will not accept anything free, many family‐planning centers, known here as Pro‐Familia, charge a fourth of the drugstore price. Even so, an increasing number of Colombian women cannot afford that. Another economic problem that many Colombian women, married or not, desire children as a means of insuring income in later years. Among the traditionally con servative Andean highland peo pie, such as those in Bogotá, only 20 per cent of the children are born out of wedlock. How ever, the rate is about 60 per cent along the tropical Atlantic and Pacific coastal areas. Many coastal Colombiani women who are unmarried tend to ignore the church's rulings on birth control, Dr. López Escobar observed, but there too children are considered a sort of social security. The political problem faced by family‐planning groups is attributed to the new stand being taken by leftist forces, in the church and in public life. “Just as we thought we had reached an informal peace pact with the church leadership.” Dr. López‐Escobar said, “we now find that the radical young priests are turning against us.” Some Sell the Pill High churchmen have gen erally let it be known, he ex plained, that as long as the family‐planning groups do not openly confront them, they will not impede the movement. In fact, many church communi ty centers sell birth‐control pills and other devices at sub sidized prices as a “health measure” for as long as 18 months after a woman has either had an abortion or given birth. Abortion is still de nounced by the church. Because many Colombian hospitals are church‐supported or connected, their attitude has opened the path toward public acceptance of birth control. However, the radical young priests, along with their lay supporters, are now taking the line that family planning is being fostered by “imperialist United States agencies” in place of social and economic aid. Many of the radicals be lieve that only a change in basic social and economic in stitutions can solve Colombia's problems. “Washington is trying to give us the pill because they think it is a simple solution to our problems,” one so‐called Marxist priest told a gathering here. “Oh, God, how Washing ton loves neat and simple solutions in Latin America First it was the Alliance for. Progress, which they are quiet ly burying. Now it is the pill.” To right‐wing political sec tors, such as the followers of the former dictator Gen. Gusta vo Rojas Pinilla, family plan ning is considered a United States ploy. General Rojas, who came close to winning the presidency last April, is charging that the election was a fraud and prom ises to battle the winner, Misael Pastrana Borrero. Many family planning officials fear the sit uation may inhibit the nev Government from further aid ing their efforts after it take office Aug. 7.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Abortion Measure Stirs Alarm,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/16/archives/abortion-measure-stirs-alarm-code-shift-barring-surgery-in-doctors.html,"City officials, physicians and leaders of what used to be the abortion‐repeal movement warned the Board of Health yesterday that its proposed amendment to the City Health Code would cancel the very benefits the state's new abor tion law was designed to bring.  Speaking at a five‐hour hear in the Department of Health building at 125 Worth Street, they said the amendment would in effect prevent low‐income and middle‐income women from getting safe, inexpensive abor tions. The amendment would re strict all abortions to hospitals or highly equipped clinics and tend to maintain the current price for an operation in such facilities, which ranges general ly for the private patient from about $400 to $1,000. Any physician who per formed an abortion in his office —at a price possibly as low as $50 — would be subject to a $1,000 fine or a year in prison. “The Board of Health's rec ommendations may in effect lock out substantial numbers of women from the possibility of obtaining an abortion in safety and comfort,” said Man hattan Borough President Percy E. Sutton. He condemned the proposal on a ground that was supriorted by virtually all the other critics who spoke at the hearing. Fears Effect “They may force the very people the law was originally intended to help to go back to illicit back‐room parlors for an abortion,” Mr. Sutton con tinued. “I am concerned that abortions may still be a right for the rich and an unobtain able privilege for the middle class and the poor.” On July 1, the day the new law went into effect, the Board of Health published in The City Record its proposed amend ment outlining specific medi cal standards for abortions. According to law it must wait three weeks to receive comment on it. Then, on July 21, it re evaluates its additional infor mation and decides finally whether to adopt the original proposal as law. If, as a result of yesterday's extremely critical testimony, the Board wishes to change the amendemnt, it has to republish and allow another three weeks to lapse again. The proposal specifies that abortions through the 12th week of pregnancy can be performed either in hospitals or outside facilities, provided these facil ities have a blood bank, a lab oratory equipped for taking X rays and making other tests, supervision by an obstetrician or a surgeon, anesthetic equip ment, an operating room and other equipment. Would Cost $250,000 The only kind of outside fa cility exempted from these re quirements which, doctors agree, would cost at least $250, 000 to provide, is one directly affiliated with a fully equipped hospital provided that traveling time to the hospital is no more than 10 minutes. Supporters of the proposal, who were largely outnumbered by critics, argued vigorously that high safety standards should not be jeopardized at this time when there is still a tremendous amount of confu sion about exactly how the new law should best be carried out. The witnesses emphasized that many of the city's leading gyne cologists recommended this ini tial stance. “Excessive bleeding, infection and sudden death are always possible,” warned Charles Gell man, president‐elect of the Greater New York Hospital As sociation and executive direc tor of Jewish Memorial Hos pital who urged that the pro posal be adopted. “The conse quences of these risks are much less dangerous when equipment for emergency action is imme diately available.” As he spoke, about 75 young women from an abortion re feral agency called Women's Abortion Project marched up and down the sidewalk outside the building to protest the cur rent prohibitively high cost of abortions. Throughout the day, as their demonstration continued, the pickets shouted “Free abor tions,” while inside a stream of 50 witnesses, took their place in front of the microphone in the middle of the room. Aside from the question of high costs, the key factor that critics of the amendment used repeatedly to support their ar gument is the long time a woman must now wait to have her operation after she has been accepted by a physician or a hospital. “In most hospitals there is a four to five week waiting period which converts a simple early abortion into a relatively dan gerous late operation,” ex plained Dr. Bernard N. Nathan son, director of gynecology at the Hospital for Joint Diseases and medical consultant to the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws. Operation Called Safe He urged that the most effec tive and safe way to eliminate this backlog is to allow doctors to perform abortions in their private offices. If this is done during the first 10 to 12 weeks of pregnancy, he argued, the operation is entirely safe. As of Tuesday, the Health and Hospitals Corporation which controls the 18 city owned hospitals reported it had a backlog of 2,510 women awaiting abortions. During the first 14 days of this month, the city hospitals performed 624 abortions. Although there are no figures for private hospitals, their available space for abortions has been reserved through the end of August, many of the spokesmen said yesterday. The City Health Department originally said all the city's combined hospitals had ade quate facilities to accommodate the approximately 50,000 wom en who were expected to seek abortions. This tentative figure does not include the unknown number of women coming here from out of state. Witnesses said yesterday that this figure could go as high as 500,000. “This amendment would leave the woman open to the same kind of mental, financial and social exploitation which she was subjected to in the old days,” said 21‐year old Lynn Biederstadt, a former advertis ing copy writer from Chicago, who told the hushed audience about her abortion performed in a physician's Greenwich Vil lage office on July 1. “I just want to dispel all the horror stories you've heard and try to convince you that this can be done safely, cheaply, comfortingly and even happily without going to a hospital.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
News Summary and Index,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/16/archives/news-summary-and-index-the-major-events-of-the-day.html,"THURSDAY, JULY 16, 1970 International House and Senate conferees about to begin work on a bill to which the Cooper‐Church amendment has been attached were urged by the Nixon Administration yesterday to delete the amendment on the ground that would infringe on the Commander in Chief's responsibilities. This was probably the Ad ministration's most emphatic position thus far on the controversial amendment that bars funds for the use of American ground forces in Cambodia. [Page 1, Column 5.] The Supreme Soviet, the Soviet Union's legislative body, reappointed Premier Aleksei N. Kosygin and President Nikolai V. Pod gorny, keeping intact the country's collec tive leadership. The parliament also passed resolutions on the Middle East and Indo china, neither of which showed any changes in policy. [1:6–7.1 Secretary of State Rogers, apparently seek ing to reconcile differences between himself and the Administration on the future of Viet nam negotiations, said that the long‐term outlook held a “reasonable prospect” for negotiated settlement, but that the outlook for the next few months was not very good. [1:6.] Action on major trade legislation was com pleted by the House Ways and Means Com mittee when it voted to prevent the Presi dent from substituting a tariff on oil for the present oil‐import quota system. A Cabinet level task force had recommended such change, over strong objections by the oil industry. [1:6–7.] Spain's Supreme Court was reported to have voted to indict two Cabinet Ministers and to have asked for the lifting of immu nity from the head of the Bank of Spain in order to indict him. The indictments are in connection with a financial scandal that viewed at threatening the life of Spain's present Cabinet. [2:3–5.] National A settlement of a century‐old claim by Alaska's native population was approved by the Senate as it overwhelmingly voted to give the natives 10 million acres and $1‐bil lion in cash. The bill also contained an amendment requiring competitive bidding on oil leases. [1:8.] A bill to regulate the explosives industry in an attempt to keep high explosives out of the hands of terrorists will be sent to Congress next week, an Administration spokesman told a House Judiciary subcom mittee. The spokesman, Assistant Attorney General Will R. Wilson, said that a White House study group was working on the pro posed regulations. [1:4.] Witness after witness told the opening ses sion of public hearings before the Presi dent's Commission on Campus Unrest that there could be no peace on the nation's campuses until there was peace in Vietnam. The witnesses also spoke of drugs, sex, race and hypocrisy, but they always came back to the war. [1:3.] Negotiations opened in Detroit between the United Automobile Workers and the Gen eral Motors Corporation with the president of the U.A.W. saying that a noninflationary settlement reached without a work stoppage would be the greatest contribution to the country that the two giant organizations could make. [18:5–8.] Metropolitan The Lindsay administration called on land lords to reject their leadership and end the 10‐day‐old apartment strike. A spokesman for the Mayor said that the city had no choice other than restoring services in build ings where health hazards existed. Ten more buildings were certified as emergency situa tions by the Health Department. Such certi fication is necessary before the city can restore services. [1:1–2.] Eight men, including two alleged to be the city's most influential loan sharks, were arrested in the first combined operation of the Federal joint strike force on organized crime since its creation a year ago. The eight, along with two others still being sought, were indicted on bookmaking, loan‐sharking and contempt charges. [1:1.] Witnesses told a public hearing on a pro posed amendment to the City's Health Code restricting abortions to hospitals or highly equipped clinics that the amendment would discriminate against low‐income and middle income women by keeping the prices for an abortion above what these women could afford. [24:2–4.] Two policemen were arrested in connec tion with the alleged theft of $100,000 that had been turned over to them by a man who had found the money. In an unusual move, Bronx District Attorney Burton B. Roberts demanded that bail be set for the defendants.

Abortion Guidelines,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/17/archives/abortion-guidelines.html,"Lines have been sharply drawn between opposing factions at the Board of Health hearing on the City Health Code amendment to govern abortions under the state's liberal new law. The proposed guidelines emphasize patient safety by requiring that these op erations be conducted primarily in hospitals or other facilities which are well equipped to take care emergencies, an attitude supported by many—though not all—gynecologists. Opponents of the amendment fear it will restrict the number of abortions severely, make them relatively expensive and turn abortion, Borough President Percy E. Sutton's words, into “an ??obtainable privilege” for the middle class and the poor. We think that until the city has had more ex perience with legal abortions, it would be advisable for the Board of Health to defer imposing too rigid rules. After several months, there will be many more data available to serve as guides for rule‐making. Ideally, the city needs a series of special abortion clinics staffed by adequately trained physicians and providing day care for ambulatory patients. Such establishments, set up in cooperation with teaching hospitals, could provide low‐cost abortions while main taining organizational affiliations to assure proper care of patients running into trouble. Such clinics ought to be funded as rapidly as possible, particularly in the low and middle‐income areas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ABORTION REFUSAL IS MADE TEST CASE,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/18/archives/abortion-refusal-is-made-test-case.html,"Presbyterian Hospital was di rected by a Federal Court judge yesterday to explain why it re fused to let a doctor on its staff perform an abortion on an unmarried 18‐year‐old girl who did not have her parents' consent.  The order, which was signed by Judge Thomas F. Croake, is returnable in Federal Court at 10 A.M. Tuesday. The girl, who was given the fictitious name of Sally Poe in the court papers to protect her anonymity, is eight weeks' preg nant. She has been living away from her family since October and has been her own sole source of support since then. She was graduated from public high school in June and does not want her parents to know about her pregnancy. The new abortion law that went into effe??t in New York State July 1 says that only the woman's consent is neces sary—along with that of the doctor—for her to have an abortion and makes no men tion of minors. The city hospi tals are performing abortions on unmarried women who say that they are emancipated mi nors, meaning those who are out on their ow. But voluntary (or nonprofit) hospitals such as Presbyterian, which is part of the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center at Broadway and 168th Street, can make their own rules. The doc tor who brought the suit, Dr. Robert Hall, the obstetrician gynecologist in the case, said the present policy of the hospi tal was to require parental consent for an abortion on any unmarried female under the [age of 21.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
New York,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/19/archives/new-york-lindsay-trouble-is-a-mayors-lot-to-curb-taxicab-crime.html,"John V. Lindsay was riding through the streets of New York in a mayoral limousine a couple of years ago when he started talking about what it would be like to be a United States Senator: “Best job in the world. A pleasant place to work, and all you have to do is show up for a few votes and make a dozen speeches a year. And if the speeches are tough enough, everyone says, ‘Boy has he got guts.’” Among other things, the Senate is a nice place to be if you happen to be running for President. A Senator — say, Edmund S. Muskie of Maine or George McGovern of South Dakota—can travel the coun try talking about the great isssues with students, bank ers or political leaders. At each stop, he can deny he is interested in the White House in 1972. City Hall, on the other hand, is a terrible place to be if you want to get away for a little campaigning. Let us as sume—as every politician in New York does—that Mr. Lindsay was very interested in the Gallup poll today that showed he would run almost as well as Mr. Muskie as the Democratic candidate against President Nixon and George C. Wallace in 1972. What's a Mayor to do when he has a week like the one that ended yesterday: (1)—The 12‐day‐old‐strike of janitors, elevator operators and doormen of at least 1,000 large apartment houses con tinued as the Mayor fought in court for the right to have the city take over essential serv ices in the struck buildings. (2)—In another court, the city lost a case to the Patrol men's Benevolent Association that could mean the Mayor will have to find $200‐million to increase the wages of po licemen, firemen and other municipal employes. (3)—On Friday, two sub way trains collided in Brook lyn, injuring 37 passengers, and the Mayor was there calling for an investigation. Has to Be There The Mayor always has to be there. People expect him to settle the dispute between the Building Service Employes Union and the landlords; the policemen want their raises, and subway riders expect their Mayor to be concerned. Mr. Lindsay catches editorial flak when he occasionally slips away to the Caribbean for a few days, and it is hard to imagine what the local re action would have been last week if he had been in Des Moines telling voters how worried he was about infla tion and Indochina. That is where John Lind say, Mayor of the nation's largest city and potential Presidential candidate, is at today. He can read the Gallup poll—it shows him getting 29 per cent to 45 for Mr. Nixon if he becomes a Democrat— but he really doesn't have much time these days to think about whether he should remain a Republican, try for the Democratic nomination or listen to the people telling him to run for President as an independent peace candi date. The apartment strike is Mr. Lindsay's most immediate problem, with many thousands of his constituents suffering because of a complicated dis pute involving landlords, em ployes and the revised rent control law signed nine days ago by the Mayor. The union called the walk out in many buildings where landlords were refusing to sign a new contract—nego tiated with the Mayor's help —because, the owners con tended, they could not afford wage increases unless rent controls were relaxed even more. City Hall won the right in Supreme Court last week to pressure the landlords into signing by having city agen cies hire the striking em ployes to provide services in buildings where health haz ards could be certified. When these problems are solved, or at least go away for awhile, there will be new ones, if history is any guide. History also provides one oth er guideline: No Mayor of New York has ever been clected to higher office. —RICHARD REEVES To Curb Taxicab Crime Driving a taxicab has be come one of the more peril ous occupations in New York City. In the first six months of 1970, five drivers were killed in hold‐ups, compared with three in all of 1969; also in the first six months of this year, a total of 1,566 cabbies were robbed, compared with 1,471 in all of 1969. So bad is the situation that 39,000 cab drivers here had threatened to strike at mid night tomorrow, and the owners of 6,900 fleet cabs threatened a daily midnight to‐6‐A.M. shutdown for some time this week. Last week, Police Commis sioner Howard R. Leary an nounced that at least 50 po licemen would start cruising the streets soon in dummy taxicabs in a move to cut down on the crime. Passen gers will be delivered to their destinations by the police drivers, with half the fare going to the police pension fund. The announcement ap peared to have forestalled the threatened strike. Spokes men for both the drivers and the owners hailed the plan as a move that would dis courage crimes against the drivers. “It's good publicity,” said a spokesman for the fleet owners, “for a stick‐up man to figure that every other cab in the city has a cop driving it.” Abortion Facilities Under Strain For more than two weeks now, New York State has been able to boast that it has the most liberal abortion law in the country. But as the ma chinery of hospital adminis tration shifts slowly but sure ly into high gear to handle the massive program, there still seem to be more ques tions about the size of the de mand — and the ability to meet it—than there are an swers. Here in New York, the 15 city hospitals that are equipped to handle obstetrics performed a total of 716 abor tions in the first two weeks that the new law was in ef fect. However, more than 2,500 women have registered for abortions in those hos pitals, the result being that, in some hospitals where the demand has been heavy, a woman must wait as long as six weeks from the time she registers until the abortion can be performed. For women well into their pregnancies, this time lapse can be critical, if not prohibitive to having the abortion at all. Before the new law went into effect on July 1, there were predictions that 50,000 to 100,000 women in New York City alone would seek abortions annually. Another 500,000, it was estimated, would flock to the city from out of state. The city hospi tals announced that they would perform a total of 3,000 abortions a month to meet their share of the load. At the rate they have been performing abortions during these first two weeks, the hospitals are living up to about half of their promise. However, it is expected that they will soon he fulfilling their original predictions. It is impossible to estimate the total demand at the vol untary (or nonprofit) and pro prietary (or profit‐making) hospitals because many ap plications for abortions are made not to the hospitals di rectly, but to doctors on their staffs. Indications seem to be, however, that many of the voluntary hospitals are drag ging their feet because of re sistance from nurses to as sisting on abortions or be cause the hospitals themselves have established arbitrary rules as to who may and may have abortions. One of the major road blocks to meeting the demand is cost. Although indigents can receive free abortions at the city hospitals, persons in low‐income brackets must pay the going rate; this ranges from about $145 for an early abortion to $650 to $800 for an abortion after the 14th or 15th week of pregnancy. On Wednesday, the Board of Health held hearings on its proposed amendment to the City Health Code. The legisla tion would limit abortions to hospitals or highly equipped clinics, and prohibit physi cians from performing abor tions in their offices. Opponents of the proposed amendment argued that the demand for abortions could never he met unless the op erations could be performed in doctors' offices, adding that this was the only way of assuring that costs would come down. Planned Parent hood of New York City also announced that it was filing a letter of intent with the State Department of Health to establish a free ‐ standing clinic that would serve 8,000 women a year at fees of about nit $100 an abortion. —DEIRDRE CARMODY",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Will we say, ‘It just happened,’ when the world overpopulates itself to extinction?",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/19/archives/will-we-say-it-just-happened-when-the-world-overpopulates-itself-to.html,"NEW ORLEANS. SITTING on the edge of her bed in a bleached smock stamped “Charity Hospital,” her hair in pigtails tied with faded red ribbon, she might easily have been taken for a child only knocking at the door of puberty. But Bonnie Higgins, a frail and unmarried, 18‐year‐old, black high‐school senior, had awakened that morning in the maternity ward, six hours after giving birth to a prema ture‐infant son. She had no flowers, no visitors (nor the prospect of any, for the hospital said it was too over crowded and understaffed to receive relatives, even husbands, of the indi gent women who come there to give birth). In fact, Bonnie Higgins hadn't even been shown her baby yet when Patricia Rodney, a nurse who intro duced herself as being “from Family Planning,” started in talking to her about contraception. “Did you want this pregnancy or did it just happen?” the nurse asked. “It just happened.” “Did you use any form of birth control?” Bonnie gravely shook her head no. Mrs. Rodney proceeded briskly, not even pausing to deliver a sales pitch for the service she was offering, her sense of when it was understood and desired having been honed in hun dreds of such encounters with young mothers in maternity wards. Five weeks from that morning, she said, Bonnie would have an appointment at the clinic of Louisiana Family Planning, Inc., where she would be counseled and examined and given an opportunity to select a contracep tive method. Bonnie gravely shook her head yes, and the nurse moved on to the next bed. “Did you want this pregnancy or did it just happen?” she began again. “It just happened,” came the al most inevitable response, this time from a 27‐year‐old woman who had given birth during the night to her fourth child. In all, 19 mothers in the previous 24 hours had given birth to 20 chil dren (one had twins). And that morning Mrs. Rodney's stock ques tion brought the stock response, “It just happened,” 18 times. In a world in which contraceptive technology and human motivation had both been perfected, this would have been grounds enough for predicting a slight dip in the birth rate in New Orleans, for none of the women expressed indifference to what the nurse was offering. In this world, it was evi dence at least for saying that a dip was not impossible. LOUISIANA Family Planning, Inc. (a nonprofit corporation supported mainly by Federal and private foun dation funds) makes no claim as yet to the achievement of a verifiable reduction in birth rates. But a reduc tion is confidently expected on the basis of surveys showing that 45 per cent of its patients had never tried any kind of contraceptive before coming to its clinics, while only 26 per cent had used the pill or the loop, the methods deemed most relia ble. At the clinics, 80 per cent go in for the pill or the loop; some form of con traceptive is selected by 96 per cent. Whatever its impact on the birth rate, in the three years since it opened its door here, Family Planning, Inc. has made Louisiana—a state normal ly found near the bottom on scales of social welfare and, what's more, one of the most Catholic of states— the first in the Union to offer easy and comprehensive, almost automatic, gynecological care and contraceptive assistance to any indigent woman who wants it. Remarkably, the Louisi ana program is already being cited as a model for other states and other countries that have awakened, or are awakening, to the socio‐psycho‐politi cal‐medical issues raised by the popu lation dilemma. Family Planning, Inc., is now es tablished in 88 different locations throughout Louisiana. More than one– third of the 160,000 eligible women in the state have already been en rolled and each month brings 3,000 new patients, plus 20,000 old patients returning to the clinics on regular visits. In New Orleans, better than 80 per cent of the black women be tween the ages of 20 and 24 are participating, a level of involvement that leaves little room for doubt about the receptivity of prospective patients. OF course, to those who believe that this country, despite its com paratively modest rate of population increase of less than 1 per cent a year, is teetering now on the brink of demographic disaster, it is fatuous, not to say immoral, to suggest that dispensing pills and loops and foams to indigent women is any kind of response to the problem of too many people. Obviously this is a middle class country, so it should be just as obvious that most breeding is done here by middle‐class men and women. Thus the government's concentration on the procreative proclivities of the poor is often viewed with sus picion. For instance, “Muhammed Speaks,” the organ of the Black Muslim movement, has charged that “black people are the target of birth control not because the ruling politi cians like them and care about their economic equality, but because they hate them and can no longer use them in plantations and other cheap labor conditions.” Another word for birth control, the paper suggested, was “genocide.” In academic terms, distinguished demographers, notably Dr. Kingsley Davis of the University of California, have heaped scorn on the casual assumption of a cause ‐ and ‐ effect connection between the voluntary practice of contraception by any class left free to decide how many children it will have and the goal of popula tion control in an overpeopled world —a world that will double its num bers before the century ends, having done so once since its beginning. Cou ples that are left free may well freely decide, in the aggregate, to have more children than the world can stand. In fact, Dr. Davis and many others consider it a virtual certainty that they will do so. Yet a year ago, in the first Presi dential message on the population problem ever delivered, Richard Nixon emphasized the “absolute right” of couples to make their own decisions about the size of their families, promising that the Govern ment would never “infringe on the religious convictions, personal wishes and freedom of any individual.” Al though only a handful of zealots, as yet, would have it otherwise, the firmness of that commit ment by the President left wide open the question of whether public policy could have any significant effect on the rate of population growth, even as he appeared to be set ting forth public policy for the first time. There's a project in Louisiana which is demonstrating that a lot can be done about mounting births—as well as inferior child care. At left, a talk on contra ception in New Orleans. At present there are about 3.5 million births in the United States a year. Beyond that fact, the arithmetic gets controversial and obscure. Ac cording to one estimate, roughly one–third of all these births are what are later, jokingly or ruefully, referred to as “mistakes.” If a study conducted by Dr. Charles Westoff of Princeton is taken as a guide, it appears that the poor and near‐poor account for slightly less than half of the total “unwanted” births. Thus if they were to gain per fect control of their fertility —something no one else seems to have done—there would be roughly half a million few er babies in this country every*year. In essence, if the programs President Nixon laid down were completely successful, we might expect to see the present crop of babies re duced only by about 10 per cent—an important step to the goal of a stable popula tion but hardly enough for its fulfillment. FEW of those who belittle the Federal programs as an inadequate or even meretri cious response to the popula tion problem argue against the practice of family plan ning for its own sake. Such an argument would be espe cially hard to maintain against a woman who had just dis covered that child‐bearing need not be an annual or every‐other‐year thing; and whatever might be supposed, such women still exist in sig nificant numbers. For instance, there is Mrs. Gloria Favorite who had nine babies in only seven years by the time Louisiana Family Planning, Inc. opened its doors here. Mrs. Favorite says she broke her first appoint ment at the clinic because she thought its service literally “too good to be true” and, therefore, not worth the trip. In those days, she recalls, “My husband and I were so afraid of making a baby that we were scared even to talk to each other.” Desperate as she was, she was even more fatalistic. Her grandmother said what grand mothers everywhere, it seems, have always said—“God won't give you more children than you can bear.” Not having broken under the strain of nine, Mrs. Favorite had to concede that might be so. Today, her family firmly closed, she is employed by Family Planning, Inc. as one of a team of auxiliary workers who go out to the community to find granddaughters who haven't yet heard, or don't wholly comprehend what they have heard. (When a reputed ly “militant” spokesman raised the “genocide” issue here, he was promptly silenced, not by white social workers but black mothers who used their own intelligence network in the community to discover and make known the fact that his wife was on the pill and had limited their family to three well‐spaced children). RESIDENT Nixon estimated that there were about five million indigent women with no access to assistance on contraception and proclaimed the national goal of providing such help to any woman who wants it inside of five—now four — years. Some experts said his estimate of five mil lion was on the high side. Others—perhaps inevitably— contended that those poor women who really wanted smaller families would have found a way not to enlarge theirs and, therefore, the re mainder probably didn't care. That ancient assumption was one of the first hurdles the organizers of Family Plan ning, Inc. had to clear when they set out to achieve here in Louisiana what later was to become a national goal. They did so by conducting a survey that showed that the over whelming majority of indigent women in New Orleans had no clear idea how the repro ductive cycle works or how pregnancy actually begins, and that they desired contracep tive assistance but tended to rely on such folk methods as the Coca Cola douche or the aspirin douche. The survey was then shown to the Family Life Bureau of the Roman Catholic Church, which quietly promised not to fight the program so long as no advertising was conducted on behalf of contraception; the possibility of the rhythm method was at least men tioned at the clinic (there have been few takers), and nothing was done to promote sterilization and abortion. The Pharmaceutical Association also had to be persuaded that druggists wouldn't be harmed by the dispensing of free pills to indigent women—the argu ment being that women who were too poor to buy them now might become less poor and, therefore, better custom ers if given the chance to limit their families. Finally, Louisiana's Attorney General “reinterpreted” a law that made it illegal to publish “any account” of “a drug or nos trum purporting to be exclu sively for the use of females for preventing conception.” All this was accomplished by quiet diplomacy—“without a shot being fired or a line in the newspapers,” as one Family Planning, Inc. official noted—in order to avoid con troversy or a species of sup port that could have proved just as fatal—that is, support from white supremacists who had already seen possibilities for their cause in birth control for blacks. As it was once put by the late Leander Perez, the excommunicated Catholic who led the last stand against integration in die‐hard Plaque mines Parish: “The best way to hate a nigger is to hate him before he's born.” BUT why Louisiana in the first place? One answer was suggested by an official of the program in the course of a visit to rural East Feliciana Parish, a county with only one resident obstetrician ‐ gynecol ogist, no hospital and a clinic that would compare unfavora bly with an average rural clinic in the most backward areas of India. “We are in terested in what it takes to run this kind of program in a developing country,” he said. “And Louisiana is a de veloping country.” The program's prime mover and director, Joseph D. Beas ley, says he was “looking for the hardest place in America to do this kind of thing.” Having done it here, he feels he can argue that it can be done anywhere. Dr. Beasley, an immigrant from Georgia, has the slightly bleary look of that breed of rising executives who, at 42 or 43, seem too worn down for their age. It is when you discover that he is actually 38 that you realize how driven he is. In conversation he often sounds as if he were testify ing before a Congressional committee—a not infrequent obligation—for he is used to beginning sentences with oro tund phrases like “we as a nation...” or even “we as a world. . ..” Remarkably single minded, he is a difficult man to deflect from the track of his thought with a question. Of course, that is also a strength. It is not the ideas he espouses that distinguish Dr. Beasley but his unremitting pursuit of their implications. His knack is to think beyond next week's directive to the staff, the way a chess player thinks beyond the gambit he is executing. “Joe rarely makes a move without knowing what his next six or seven moves will be,” says a colleague. This is more than a sense of orderliness, for Beasley is almost religiously convinced that the pseudo sciences known as administration and management hold the neces sary prescriptions for a situa tion in which health services lag light years behind the advanced state of the medical sciences, as they do for all but the wealthiest and most cosmopolitan here and throughout the world. BEASLEY was a relative latecomer in the business of limiting population, as shown by his five children. Upon fin ishing medical school he went directly into general practice near Atlanta and soon was thriving and, nearly as soon, restless. The result of earnest soul ‐ searching then was a decision to give up his prac tice, cash in his savings and go to England with his family for further studies at the Lon don School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, with the thought that this would lead to medical work in developing countries — an ambition he still nurtures. His interest in family plan ning grew out of a profession al concern with “high ‐ risk mothers,” those women who are most apt to die in preg nancy, lose their infants or give birth to defective chil dren. Not surprisingly, these were usually shown to be mothers who became pregnant a few times too often and either wore out physically or became so desperate that they sought relief through crude criminal abortions. Also not surprisingly, there appeared to be a direct connection be tween economic class and the health of the mother: In New Orleans an indigent woman runs a risk that is twice as high in pregnancy as a middle class woman. “I began to see the crucial connections between being dead and being sick and being born,” he explained. “I began to understand for the first time that you couldn't sepa rate them.” His next discovery was that these high‐risk moth ers were “damned highly motivated” to escape their predicament. The first thing many indigent women here used to ask after giving birth, obstetricians recall, was how many knots there had been in the umbilical cord. The belief was that the number foretold how many deliveries they would still have to endure. If it was small, they usually, rejoiced. Zealots for population con trol often sound scornful of those who start with such a mundane, individualized con cern as maternal health. But that concern remains central to Beasley's whole approach to family planning, for he be lieves it to be the key to reaching women and persuad ing them to limit their fami lies. “The inability of a wom an to control her own fertili ty,” he says, “deprives her of a real right and a real power. I believe in the concept of voluntarism—that human be ings can learn, that they can take the knowledge they gain and apply it to the solution of their problems, and that they have a right to do this, for they are involved in their own freedom. I think it's absurd to try to coerce a woman to do something she probably wants to do any way.” Translated into political terms, he sees himself as giv ing power to his patients— not exercising it over them. BEASLEY has been thor oughgoing in building his prin ciples into his program. The problem, he says, isn't simply to make contraceptives avail able and then do a study to see why more people have not sought to obtain them. It is to understand the needs of the women who aren't using them so that the system can adapt itself to serving them and respecting them. For this reason, Family Planning, Inc. is also in the business of providing prenatal and postnatal care and even helping sterile couples who want children. Beasley views these activities as intrinsic to his program. But they also provide an effective answer to anyone who cries “geno cide.” George Gates, a former teacher who regularly ad dresses civic and church groups in the black communi ty, states it this way: “No one can tell me that postnatal care is black genocide.” Family Planning, Inc. runs on the premise that an effi cient, flexible appointments system, uncrowded waiting rooms, facilities for looking after children, and some means of unraveling patients' transportation problems are as crucial to its success or failure as the availability of contraceptives or the compe tence of its staff. Its execu tives worry about making their clinics appear congenial and attractive the way mar keting experts worry about the look of their department stores, and with just about as much sentiment. Dehumani zation, they maintain, can be proved costly by a cost‐bene fit analysis. The result, un usual in a social‐welfare pro gram, is that most appoint ments are kept and the num ber of dropouts is held to about one in five. “Joe Beasley says that the only way you can be fired around here,” a staff member said, “is by being rude to a patient.” This can mean un learning certain quaint folk customs. For instance, when the nurse happens to be white and her patient happens to be black, the nurse is expected to remember to address her as Mrs. Jones rather than Mary Jane. In other words, the nurse is expected to assume she is dealing with a compe tent adult and not a helpless child. SOMEWHAT nervously, Beasley and his colleagues find themselves regularly pre occupied by the problem of what to do about young wom en who come seeking their service without either of the two standard “tickets of ad mission” (as one official termed them): a marriage li cense or a prior pregnancy. In rare cases, contraceptives have been dispensed to teen agers in this category whose parents or guardians said they approved. But the main con sideration, once again, has been the avoidance of contro versy, which could prove even sharper on this point in the black community than the white. Asked why he doesn't like controversy, Beasley has a disarmingly straightforward answer: “Because then we'd lose. And we don't want to lose.” The device of a non profit corporation nicely averted the twin dangers of opposition or support from the Louisiana Legislature. With out fanfare, state health of ficials have given the pro gram valuable support from the start. BEASLEY'S preoccupation with efficiency is a measure of his success, for his biggest problem isn't to recruit pa tients but to maintain the level of services the program offers. To handle the load, Family Planning, Inc., is trying to overcome professional jeal ousies and redesign jobs so that nurses can do some of the things traditionally done by doctors, and auxiliary workers can be trained to as sume some of the burden nor mally shouldered by nurses. Deliberately the program hasn't gone outside Louisiana to meet its manpower needs because it wants to demon strate methods of dealing with mass numbers without a sacri fice of standards—a difficult problem here and an immeas urably more difficult one in developing countries to which Beasley hopes to export his methods. Characteristically, Beasley uses the language of the Jay cees, striving to be a “can‐do” man and finding it hard to believe there are things in America a “can‐do” man can't do. “I'm hell‐bent on making the system work,” he declares. It doesn't look easy. What makes family plan ning as a public concern very obviously different in kind from housing, for instance, is that money, programs and laws inevitably remain remote from what the social scien tists call the “decision‐making process.” In many cases, the decision makers are anything but deliberate about their de cision. The men and women that Family Planning, Inc., is trying to reach don't sit down to discuss whether the system can be made to work or how bad the population problem is or, indeed, whether contracep tion is a form of “genocide” before deciding how many children they want. Not many other people do, either. But asked the ideal number of children, they most often say three or four, even when they have eight or nine. Mrs. Ethel Gillis, a 30‐year‐ old mother of eight with her ninth en route, discussed her experiences with contracep tives at Family Planning, Inc.'s clinic in Baton Rouge. After her fourth child, she said, she decided to call a halt and went on the pill but it made her “fat, fat, fat” so she quit. After her fifth, she tried a foam. After her sixth, she tried another brand of pill only to find herself becoming “thin, thin, thin.” Her eighth “just happened” while she was thinking about what to do next. Now she was asking about the possibility of get ting her “tubes tied,” though she insisted, “I don't want something that takes off my nature.” Her main worry, it appeared, was how to stop having chil dren without becoming less attractive to her husband. To cite Mrs. Favorite's testimony, “There are some men who don't think they're men unless they're making a baby every year.” At least this is what some women believe, being too insecure in their relation ships to risk bringing the matter up for discussion. The anxieties of the men appear to dwell on fears that contra ception by women invites promiscuity or, at the other extreme, that it inhibits sexual response. THESE are not the kind of anxieties that many people admit to themselves, let alone in response to the brisk ques tions of a doctor or nurse. Every woman who comes to the clinic goes to a class on the advantages and disadvan tages of sundry birth‐control techniques. But Family Plan ning, Inc., is still reaching for ways to respond to unspoken, even unconscious fears. The surest way appears to be can dor on the part of other wom en, notably the auxiliary workers, who are prepared to take their time and talk from experience. Theoretically, Family Planning, Inc. doesn't advocate any particular meth od. But a chance is rarely missed to stress the fact that 20 per cent of the women who rely on foam find themselves back in the maternity wards, that a lapse in taking the pill can have the same result, and that the loop seems virtually to eliminate the margin of human error. Nevertheless, the pill re mains the most popular meth od by far, despite a distinct falling off last winter follow ing Senate hearings that called attention to its hazards for some women. In Louisiana, as in developing countries that are urging contraceptives on their people, rumors about any particular method travel quickly. For all its advan tages, the loop appears to be most susceptible to rumors because it does gravely aggra vate the menstrual cycles of a small minority of women. Many patients frequently switch methods. In between, they often get caught. Marva Dominick, a 20‐year‐ old mother of two, said she started with what she called the I.Q.U.—meaning the I.U.D., or intrauterine device — but gave it up for foam because a friend of hers was having trouble with the loop. She patted her bulging middle to indicate the result. Now, she said, “I think I'm going back to the I.Q.U. I don't want to pop out again.” By contrast, there was Mrs. Emma Burt, who went on the pill as soon as Family Plan ning, Inc. went into business and never looked back. She had two children then and that is the way it is going to remain, she vowed. Mrs. Burt is powerfully motivated to see her family get ahead. “I can tell when a young couple has decided to quit at two,” she said. “It's when I see them making plans to buy their own home.” SUCH motivation is far more evident among poor blacks here than among poor whites. Less than 1 per cent of eligible white women made use of Family Planning, Inc.'s services in its first two years in New Orleans, compared to 43.5 per cent of eligible black women. Whites accounted for not quite 6 per cent of the total patient load. In part, this may have something to do with the fact that 70 per cent of the white population in New Orleans is Catholic. But there are strong hints that the deepest reasons for white resistance to the service are racial, not religious. It is no recent discovery that racial and sexual under currents frequently flow into each other, in the South and elsewhere. Apparently the prospect of taking advice on contraceptives from a black nurse or following a black pa tient into a gynecologist's con sulting room is unbearable for many whites, more unbearable in some instances than the accustomed risk of a large family. Mrs. Lorraine Ambeau, one of the most resourceful of Family Planning, Inc.'s com munity workers and herself a mother of eight, was making her rounds one recent evening in a racially mixed neighbor hood of ramshackle, lower class houses, trying to get in touch with women who had missed appointments at the clinic. (In this way, the pro gram's staff have made more than 35,000 home visits in an effort to keep women who are motivated for family planning from being defeated by an impersonal system.) Mrs. Ambeau's referral cards didn't tell her the race of the pa tients and sometimes it was hard to guess from the ad dress or name. One doorbell was answered by a young white woman in a housedress and curlers, ob viously suspicious and even resentful of her well‐dressed, imposingly poised black caller. The brief encounter was stiff ly cordial but the vibrations it generated weren't friendly. “I'm going to a private doc tor,” the young mother said, explaining why she had skipped the appointment she made while she was in Charity Hospital's integrated ward. “‘I'm going to a private doctor,’” Mrs. Ambeau re peated after the door shut, mimicking what seemed to her to have been the edge of haughtiness in the white wom an's voice. “Well, let me tell you, she's not going to any private doctor. She just doesn't want to come to the clinic because it's integrated. Give her nine months and she'll be back in Charity Hospital hav ing another baby. Maybe then she'll have a change of heart —a lot of them are having it now.” The New Orleans experi ence shows that the achieve ment of the President's, goal —the extension of contracep tive assistance to all women in the country who need and want it by 1974—won't come as easily as it does on paper. For those to whom the serv ices are offered often are not ready to come to terms with some of their deepest, most obscure feelings. But New Orleans also shows that rapid headway can still be made. What such programs will mean in terms of the over‐all rate of population growth is a subject for debate, but no one imagines the growth will stop. Finally, the Government will be forced to decide whether to launch a campaign for the small family that could be carried to the middle class es and suburbs. At least by then, Dr. Beasley argues, the United States will have be come “believable” when it preaches the doctrine of popu lation limitation to others. It may even have learned some thing about how it is done. In the abstract, the question of whose population needs to be controlled has resounding moral overtones. For it seems obvious that fat, prosperous America (which, with only 5 per cent of the world's popu lation, manages to despoil more than half the natural re sources the world consumes) is serving its own gluttony by telling Indonesians and Indians and Chinese that there are too many of them. Some one has calculated—and the calculation seems absurdly modest — that a newborn American is likely to consume nine times as much as a new born Indian of everything the world has to offer. Thus, from a global standpoint, a single loop in an American suburb is worth a dozen or so in an Asian village. But there is no reason to imagine that a reduced rate of procreation in Peoria would mean an increased level of consumption in Peru. The urgent challenge of popula tion control plainly will re main urgent where the popu lation is densest and poorest; and it is precisely in such places that the possibility of actual control — through in centives, penal laws or sheer terror—is most remote. In such societies traditional values are most binding—the kind of values that measure a man's wealth by the num ber of his sons — and least likely to give way in a hurry to exhortation. There may be only a small chance that the poor nations of Asia, which already con tain more than half the human race, will be able to slow their rate of population growth by voluntary means. But those who speak glibly of licensing conception, compulsory steri lization, or placing sterilants in water‐supply systems are indulging even wider fan tasies. If they were practicable at all, such ventures would require expeditionary forces considerably larger than those we have sent to Vietnam—the country, after all, in which our population ‐ control pro grams have had the most im pact in recent years. SUCH speculations are provoked by the polemical writings of Dr. Paul R. Erlich of Stanford University, a lead ing theoretician of the Zero Population Growth movement. In his tract “The Population Bomb,” Erlich argues strenu ously for “effective unilateral action” by the United States in densely populated nations like India in order to enforce a low birth rate. Our Govern ment, he says, should have seized on a proposal in India for compulsory sterilization and “applied pressure” on the Government there to go ahead with it, volunteering “logistic support in the form of heli copters, vehicles and surgical instruments,” plus platoons of doctors and paramedical per sonnel. All of which has an eerily familiar ring. Erlich goes on: “Coercion? Perhaps, but coercion in a good cause. . . . We must shift our efforts from the treatment of the symptoms to the cutting out of the cancer. The operation will demand many apparently heartless and brutal decisions.” For in stance, deciding not to inter vene to prevent famines in nations whose population ex plosions have become unman ageable, but seeing to “migra tion control” at their borders (with what kind of “surgical instruments”?) so that their starving millions don't swarm across. BY contrast, Joseph Beas ley's approach here in New Orleans seems drab and plod ding. But it has its own mili tary metaphors—the clients are “target couples” and the “delivery system” is being readied to hit them with con traceptives and other services. Later, it is hoped, this same delivery system will be able to launch new and more pow erful weapons—such theoret ically feasible contraceptives as once‐a‐year antifertility injections, “morning after” pills to abort the just‐fertilized ovum, reversible sterilization of males by injections instead of surgery, plus a score of other techniques that have been broached but not ade *quately tested. Dr. Beasley and others in the field stress the fact that all the research currently be ing done in the entire world on methods of contraception costs no more than $35‐mil lion a year, an investment that would be insufficient to under write even a single day of the Vietnam war. Dr. John Rock, who helped develop the pill, recently termed the lagging research in this field “a dis grace to science.” Dr. Beas ley calls it “almost suicidal.” With the necessary commit ment, he still contends, some thing could be done to hold off the advancing human glut. And it still could be done, he believes, by methods shor",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Books of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/21/archives/books-of-the-times-the-cities-of-the-desert-the-desert-of-the-mind.html,"There hasn't been another American writer of Joan Didion's quality since Na thanael West. She writes with a razor, carving her characters out of her percep tions with strokes so swift and economical that each scene ends almost before the reader is aware of it; and yet the charac ters go on bleeding afterward. A pool of blood forms in the mind. Meditating on it, you are both frightened and as tonished. When was the wound in flicted? How long have we to live? Miss Didion's new novel combines this surgical prose with a crushing fatalism (the title refers to a crap game) that obliges her people end essly to circle themselves, reduc ing their radi uses of possibili ties seeking an exit from the “I”—and sets It all in the cities of the desert (Los Angeles, Las Vegas). While the result is not exactly pleasant, it seems to me just about perfect according to its own austere terms. PLAY IT AS IT LAYS. By Joan Didion. 214 pages. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $5.95. Maria Wyeth is an internal refugee. She was born in Nevada to parents who were always waiting for the next roll of the dice, and always losing. She went to New York, because a model, survived a disas trous affair with one man and disastrously married another (Carter Lang, demon film maker). We pick up Maria after she has starred in two of Carter's movies, given birth to a little girl with an “aberrant chemical in her brain,” aborted a second child, divorced, and retired in her 30's to Southern California with a terminal fatigue of the body and the spirit. The only game she has the energy to play is for her daughter, whom she wishes to rescue from mental home. Terrain a Mirror of Landscape Inside and outside Maria, there is only desolation. Carter, the homosexual BZ, BZ's bitchy wife, Helene, and all the other characters seem perfect children of the desert, plastic toys with spring mecha nisms inside them, wound up and sent out to whir and spin, dangerous in their very motion. The emotional terrain (brain dam age, abortion, homosexuality, suicide, mor al exhaustion) is a mirror‐image of the landscape (rattlesnakes, freeways, gam bling casinos, motorcycle gangs, drive‐in churches). One feels that, just as the char acters” consume themselves in circles and games, so the desert will swallow the er satz cities on its surface, leaving every thing to the lizards and the snakes. What makes the world of this novel, a world in which the only reply to the ques tion “Why?” is “Why not?”, so heart breaking and inescapable is Miss Didion's selection of details. There is nothing super fluous, not a word, not an incident. Per sonalities are more than sufficiently evoked in a single phrase—“Felicia always spoke on the telephone as if a spurious urgency could mask her radical lack of interest in talking to anyone”—and whole chapters are condensed into a single page. Such an economy testifies to a vision as bleak and as precise as Eliot's in “The Wasteland.” And if Randall Jarrell was right in saying that Eliot would have writ ten “The Wasteland” about the Garden of Eden, it is likely that Miss Didion would have written “Play It as It Lays” about Versailles. ‘Life Was a Crap Game’ For it is the condition of a woman's mind that is her subject; it is the “nothing ness” after one has been used as an object that she explores; it is the facts beyond “answers” or “explanations” that she plays with: “This morning I threw the coins in the swimming pool, and they gleamed and turned in the water in such a way that I was almost moved to read them. I re frained.” Or: “My father advised me that life itself was a crap game: it was one of the two lessons I learned as a child. The other was that overturning a rock was apt to reveal a rattlesnake. As lessons go those two seem to hold up, but not to apply.” And earlier Maria has written, “with the magnetized IBM pencil”—“NOTHING AP PLIES.” Cheerless, then. And there will undoubt edly be readers who ask: why doesn't this girl get her head together? Join her local Women's Liberation chapter or the Peace Corps? Go to Esalen? Read Marx? Find God? If we conceive of the novel as a kind of Drano for dissolving the sludge in the clogged plumbing of fictional characters, then certainly Miss Didion should have come up with a tidy solution. But so long as novels are permitted to be about vi sions, to explore situations, to see truths beyond individual manipulation, then Miss Didion need not equip Maria with a Roto Rooter or a dose of ideological uplift. The courage to say “Why not?” to Nothingness is more than enough. Faulkner and Mau riac were fatalists, too. So was Freud, who had the courage of his pessimism, before the epigones co‐opted him for Disneyland. Because Miss Didion is not the sort of writer who goes in for tricks on the read er, I doubt whether “Wyeth” is an inten tional play on names. Yet one can't help thinking of Andrew Wyeth's painting “Christina's World.” Maria looks up at the house on the hill. Only the house is burn ing. Perhaps she will get up, and run to save her daughter. But it is her mind burn ing, as well; and it's only a picture; and ultimately the world belongs to the rattle snakes. Nothing applies.

ABORTION DEATH REPORTED BY CITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/21/archives/abortion-death-reported-by-city-victim-is-first-here-since-state.html,"The city's Medical Examiner described yesterday the first reported death resulting from an abortion since a new state law went into effect permitting a woman to undergo an abor tion with only the consent of her physician. The law, passed by the last Legislature, went into effect July 1.  Dr. Milton Helpern, the Med ical Examiner, said that Mrs, Carmen Rodriguez had died Sunday in Lincoln Hospital, the Bronx, of “the effects of an abortion.” He said an autopsy per formed by Dr. Richard Beagh ler, an associate medical ex aminer, had confirmed that the woman was “aborted in the manner planned” but that she had a heart ailment that was “a contributory cause” to the death. Dr. Helpern said the autopsy Showed that Mrs. Rodriguez had reacted to an injection of a s alt solution that is used in the abortion procedure. He said she had survived the effects of the operation for four days but Was in a coma during that pe riod. Mrs. Rodriguez, according to Dr. Helpern, had a history of rheumatic fever when she was admitted to Lincoln Hos pital for the abortion. 3,000 Abortions a Month When the liberal abortion law was adopted, a spokesman for the city's Hospitals Depart ment said that “we can tolerate three deaths per 100,000 pa tients.” City hospitals, it was estimated, would handle 3,000 abortions a month. According to an official of the Health and Hospitals Corporation, “that's about the way it's running right now.” The operation touched off violent reaction by the Young Lords, a militant Puerto Rican group, who charged last Tues day that physicians at Lincoln Hospital “knew she had a se rious heart condition and they did not take the proper pre cautions.” In a leaflet distributed to residents of the Lincoln Hos pital area, the Young Lords declared: “This is murder.” For 12 hours last Friday group led by the Young Lords occupied the old Lincoln Hospit al School of Nursing at Bruck ner Boulevard and 141st Street now used for administrative offices — charging that the hospital was “only a butcher Shop that kills patients and frustrates workers from serv ing these patients.” A spokesman for the hos pital said he had no comment on the Medical Examiner's re port, saying, he had not seen it yet. Meanwhile, Miss Merle Gold berg, executive director of the group that sponsors the Wom en's Abortion Clinic, said she hoped the death of Mrs. Rodri guez would not deter women from seeking abortions if nec essary. “We have handled 2,300 abortions without a mishap,” she said. “One fatality should not distort the fact that a pro cedure done below the 10th Week is a perfectly safe, nor mal any woman should be able to undergo.” Miss Goldberg said repre sentatives of her group had met with Board of Health offi cials to argue against guide lines limiting abortions to hos pitals with gynecological facil ities. Another meeting will take place today, she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ABORTION CURBS PUT OFF BY CITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/22/archives/abortion-curbs-put-off-by-city-health-board-awaits-more-data2.html,"The Board of Health an nounced yesterday that it would defer action on incorporating its proposed amendment on abortion services into the City Health Code.  The amendment would re strict all abortions to hospitals or well‐equipped clinics and prohibit doctors from perform ing them in their offices. Op ponents of the proposal, who testified at a five‐hour hearing last week, say that the only way to meet the demand for abor tions and to keep the price reasonable is to permit doctors to perform them in their offices. After meeting for three hours yesterday, the board announced that there had been “sufficient data” since the state's new abortion law went into effect July 1 to warrant putting the proposals into law. As soon as the board feels that such evi dence is available, a final deter mination on the proposed amendment will be made. Office Abortions Now Legal At present, doctors can le gally perform abortions in their offices, but the practice has been condemned by the Health Department guidelines, which most doctors are wary of defy ing. If the proposals are incor porated into the City Health Code, they will then become law. In another development yes terday, the deaths of two wo men who had recently received abortions were reported by medical authorities. They em phasized, however, that the deaths were not directly caused by the abortions themselves and might have occurred under other circumstances. Pearl Schwier, who was 42 years old and in her 20th week of pregnancy, died July 6 at St. Luke's Hospital about 45 minutes after a hysterotomy, a major operation in which the uterus is opened and the fetus removed. The operation was performed under a general anesthetic. Dr. Milton Helpern, the city's Chief Medical Examiner, described the death as “really an anes thesia death.” Dr. Helpern said that a from anesthesia are reported to his office every year. The death was confirmed by a spokesman at St. Luke's, who said the hospital would have no com ment to make on it. Harlem Hospital Death Another woman, Barbara Riley, died Monday at Harlem Hospital six days after a dila tion and curettage abortion and four days after a sterilization operation. The 23‐year‐old wo wan, who had three previous pregnancies, one of which re sulted in still‐birth, suffered from sickle cell anemia, a gen etic blood disease. According to Dr. Stanley Bergen, senior vice president for medical affairs at the Health and Hospitals Corpora tion, a therapeutic abortion, which was recommended by the hospital, would have been recommended even under the state's old abortion law. He said that in the Riley case the patient went into a state of “cycle cell crisis” after the sterilization operation and that all her blood cells began to break down. The actual cause of death has not been determ ined pending the results of an autopsy. On Monday, the Medical Ex aminer's office disclosed the first reported death resulting from an abortion since the new law went into effect July 1. Mrs. Carmen Rodriguez died Sunday at Lincoln Hospital, four days after an abortion. A heart ailment was said to be a “contributing cause” of death. The Health and Hospitals Corporation said yesterday that through Monday 996 abortions had been performed in city hos pitals since July 1. There is a list of 2,892 persons awaiting abortions, although a spokes man warned that this figure might be deceptive because wo men often register in more than one hospital.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Criminals At Large,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/26/archives/criminals-at-large.html,"A good bit of suspense is inherent in the unveiling of a murderous conspiracy — for example, the slaying of a series of perhaps dimly related peo ple for no discernible motive. Philip MacDonald played this theme exceedingly well in his 1959 novel “The List of Adrian Messenger,” and Loren Singer now also uses it as his point of departure in THE PARAL LAX VIEW (Doubleday, $4.95). But Mr. Singer's prose has a deliberate and annoying tur bidity, and the telling is heavy with social and political impli cation. Twenty‐five people wit nessed some terrifying earlier event, and of these only four still live. To them it becomes apparent that many of the 21 deaths were arranged. The sur vivors, driven together by fear but no mutual trust or affection, inquire, strike tender nerves, provoke and commit violence, react in different ways accord ing to their psychological frameworks (guilt, zest), and plunge toward a fatal inevita bility. What, the author seems to wonder in all this, are the means human (but not neces sarily humane) society might itself? It has, in the past, been im possible to keep the annual Dick Francis novel off the Best of the Year list. In some con fidence I'm going to anticipate myself and nominate ENQUIRY (Harper & Row, $4.95) to that select circle. It has the ele ments that Mr. Francis handles so superbly: horse‐racing so vi brantly portrayed that it fairly gallops from the pages; an en gaging hero (Kelly Hughes) be set by injustice; and an inob trusive but tangy romantic flavor. Hughes, a successful steeplechase jockey educated above his humble birth, is warned off the turf on a charge of throwing a race. His boss is an arrogant trainer who de flates in defeat, but Hughes sets out to find the weak corner in the frame around him, a course of action filled with sus pense, high drama and hatred of revenge. THE ASEY MAYO TRIO (1946), the latest in the Norton reprint series ($4.95) of Phoebe Atwood Taylor's detective fic tion, provides the author an unusual form, the novelette. And Asey Mayo—the Cape Cod Uncle Abner with overtones of Philo Vance — is in good form dealing with three war time cases of extravagant murder. In “The Third Mur derer” the crime occurs in a perambulating cottage; in “Murder Rides the Gale” a driverless carriage bolts out of a New England thunderstorm into a barn giving refuge to Mayo and presents him with a pretty female corpse; and in “The Stars Spell Death” Asey stumbles on the body of a gifted amateur astronomer, who had alienated one and all by his penchant for onion sand wiches and grubbiness of spirit. John Creasey's latest Inspec tor West novel, A PART FOR A POLICEMAN (Scribner's, $4.50) is a disappointment in this usually very reliable se ries: The plot is held at loose rein, with the rather unpersua sive solution revealed in drib bles and the dramatic poten tial of a conflict between West and his wife not fully realized. Irish actor Danny O'Hara is beaten to death in his apart ment, a spacious affair furn ished for various erotic recre ations. West is called in, to be greeted at once by the mur derous fury of another Irish man, who claims O'Hara de spoiled his daughter. There are more Irish in the stew, the trail leads to a secret abortion clinic and thence to Britain's leading film studio — where not for the last time West is just a little too late to prevent vio lence. Rosemary Harris's A WICKED PACK OF CARDS (Walker, ($4.50) has many of the trap pings of a gothic: a heroine, en dangered both by romantic un certainties as well as her dim perception of danger, menaced by the fogs and mists of sea side Britain and the hint of supernatural evil just offstage. Jane Halliford's unease of mind over the assaults of her two swains and her budding career as a novelist is in no wise soothed by the attentions of the village fortuneteller and the gift of a tarot deck. Nor by mur der, possibly witnessed by her precocious niece, who — mo mentarily, at least—remem bers nothing. It's an effective story of its type, with idiotic heroics kept at a tolerably low level. Victor Canning's QUEEN'S PAWN (Morrow, $5.95) is a carefully revealed character study of a complex non‐hero, Andrew Raikes. Raikes one day met a perfect partner, and for years the pair pyramided fraud after fraud until at last, having amassed their desired fortunes, they retired in apparent safety. During the years, however, a small mistake was made, insig nificant really, but now it has put them in the hands of a banker who likes to control people, and who has an idea about hoisting a ton of gold out of the Queen Elizabeth II But Raikes, saddled with a wo man he loves‐despises and see ing his dream collapsing, will not be controlled. This is a long book, perhaps longer than best would be, but memorable in and climax. “Fred Levron” (the pseudo nym of a New York physician) has been silent in our genre since his successful 1955 lam poon of Mystery Writers of America and its mystery writing course (“Much Ado About Murder”). Now comes THE MANX CAT (World, $4.95), wholly serious in tone and re presenting a significant matur ing in style. The protagonist is a young college student, re jected by parents, numerous universities, and, basically, by himself. Driven by a deep‐seated phobia about cats, he crosses to an apartment building near his to kill a Manx — and, very incidentally, its owner, who ob jects. Next come confronta tions with the school psychia trist, who senses desperate trouble but not death, and his mother and father. Then he turns his twisted attentions to the new occupant of the mur der apartment. Here is a good sense of blind doom, of the confused terror of the totally solitary person. ■",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New Yorkers Taking Smog in Stride,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/30/archives/new-yorkers-taking-smog-in-stride.html,"With smarting eyes and raw throats, New Yorkers went about their business yesterday under a six‐day‐old blanket of stagnant smog.  “After I came to wont to day.” a midtown secretary said, “I felt like I should take out my whole respiratory system and wash it.” But city health officials re ported no significant increase in emergency calls from people who suffer most from foul air — victims of asthma, emphy sema, tuberculosis and chronic bronchitis. “There's no pattern that would suggest an increased load of respiratory ailments,” said Dr. Aaron D. Chaves, the Health Department's assistant commissioner for chronic and communicable disease services. Dr. Chaves's report was based on queries his staff made yesterday to the largest of the city's 18 municipal hospitals, the major private hospitals and the five county medical socie ties and a check of calls for hospital and Police Department ambulances. “I'm not suggesting that air pollution hasn't reached a dan gerous stage,” Dr. Chaves said, “but the evidence so far doesn't indicate any health effects that we could definitely blame on pollution. “Sure, people complain. And this could become really serious if it continues. All I'm saying is that up to now we have no proof.” He noted, though, that the health effects of air pollution were cumulative and would be come apparent after prolonged exposure. Dr. Chaves said his survey had been particularly careful to query the chiefs of pul monary services at major hos pitals. An independent check of hospitals here did not con tradict his findings. “It was surprisingly slow,” said a physician at Bronx Muni cipal Hospital. “We had one asthmatic come in for a shot, but that was all. It was defin itely below par.” At Columbia‐Presbyterian, a spokesman said: “We had whole lot of cases, but that's not unusual.” Brooklyn Jewish Hospital re ported no admissions for res piratory ailments. “Surprising ly slow,” a spokesman com mented. “The only heavy thing we had all day was the num ber of abortions.” Similar reports came from health officials throughout the area that lies beneath the high pressure system extending from New York to Atlanta.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Letters to the Editor of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/31/archives/letters-to-the-editor-of-the-times.html,"Proposal for Vietnam To the Editor: One of the stumbling blocks to peace in Vietnam is the po sition taken by President Thieu (with our support) in opposi tion to an imposed interim gov ernment in South Vietnam, while the North Vietnamese and the Vietcong express op position to anything less as well as to the inclusion of Thieu and Ky in any coalition government. Yet, all sides have given ex pression at various times to a desire for a permanent peace; hence it becomes urgent and necessary to find a new ap proach to this deadlock. Perhaps the answer may be found through the device of caretaker government staffed by foreign neutrals under the auspices of the United Nations Trusteeship Council or other suitable body. This government would take office and declare a cease‐fire at which time all troops would be required to remain in bivouac at current locations pending evacuation. The Trustees would simultane ously establish a peacekeeping military force seconded by neu tral nations. Upon the deter mination of the Trustees as to appropriate times and other details, all foreign military per sonnel would be evacuated from Vietnam to their own countries prior to a pre‐or dained deadline. In the interim, the details of the election of a new govern ment would be arranged and the election would be super vised by the Trustees who would relinquish the reins of government to the victors. ALBERT ORNSTEIN New York, July 27, 1970 • Quotas and Jobs To the Editor: Letters on import quotas from the United Hatters, Cap and Millinery Workers and the Amalgamated Clothing Work ers are far from the mark on the relation of quotas to jobs. Import pressure is a minor source of job‐loss compared with men's ceasing to wear hats, displacement of cotton and wool by U.S.‐produced syn thetics, modern plant layouts that cut costs in ways that old plants cannot match. With or without expansion of imports, economic progress will always wipe out some existing jobs as it creates new ones. To help people whose jobs are threatened, we can improve job counseling to steer young people out of blind alleys and reduce their competition with those already in overstaffed industries. We can sharply im prove programs for retraining and relocation of workers who do get displaced. We can re design housing policies so that semi‐skilled and unskilled work ers can find housing at accept able cost near the suburban centers where most new jobs are generated. With such pol icies, the additional dislocations from import expansion can be taken in stride. Import re strictions without such policies will make little impression on the problem of jobs. Import restrictions, besides, can destroy jobs. In many in dustries, imports are key mate rials. Foreign retaliation against U.S. import restrictions will cut into U.S jobs in export lines. To the extent that import re strictions set back overseas de velopment, they reduce our sales of equipment and semi finished goods to underdevel oped countries. Reducing competition from imports makes this country more inflation ‐ prone, which also is bait for jobs. For with reduced resistance to price in creases the Government has less scope for monetary‐fiscal measures to combat unemploy meat and such measures if adopted are less effective. U.S. adoption of these import quotas would signify abandoning our position of leadership in two important international fields. The ban on “quantitative restrictions” which this country has done so much to promote is a major bulwark against economic war fare in the style of the 1930's. Our leadership in development programs is also at stake. Perhaps Japan is no longer “underdeveloped.” But Korea and Taiwan would suffer di rectly from quotas, and other underdeveloped countries would face the threat of the same treatment. With aid‐for‐devel opment already being cut, how can we also undermine trade for‐development? ALBERT G. HART New York, July 27, 1970 This letter was also signed by nine other members of the Department of Economics at Columbia University. • Safety in Numbers? To the Editor: In reference to the D.C. crime control law, I feel that living in a state of constant curfew (home before dark behind closed doors) we cannot enjoy the luxury of the civilized Rom an philosophy “Better ten guilty men go free, than one innocent man jailed.” Unfortunately, civilized laws do not remedy an uncivilized society. A large percentage of the guilty are “repeaters.” Set ting ten of them free, how does that protect the innocent? I recognize the fear of the “police state.” I also recognize the ex istence of the “criminal state.” Is it not time for a compromise “Better eight guilty men go free, than one innocent man jailed”? Perhaps a mathematician, us ing statistics, can come up with the answer, under what condi tions would the innocent be protected most? Perhaps the Romans them selves started with “Better twenty guilty men go free.” FRED ADLER New York, July 26, 1970 • Encyclical Hailed To the Editor: In the two years that have now passed since Pope Paul issued the encyclical Humane Vitae reiterating Church teach ing on the immorality of artificial birth prevention, the course of events has provided further perspectives from which to assess the significance of his pronouncement. At its publication the en cyclical was angrily accused of being, on the one hand, an infringement on the freedom of married couples to plan their own families, and on the other, a potential obstruction to needed public programs of contraception for population control. The mutually contradictory nature of these objections, which should have been evi dent from the beginning, is now shown with unmistakable clarity by the increasingly overt suggestions of coercion in the population‐control cam paign — a campaign which, curiously and ominously, finds the Nixon Administration and the liberal media in accord. The “encouraging” of small families through tax incen tives, the foisting of contracep tion and abortion on welfare recipients, the requiring of a license for having children as some are already bold enough to advocate: such proposals very definitely imply that in dividual couples should not be free to plan their own families. The attack on the spouses' self‐determination does not come from the Pope, who has simply tried to teach them what they should and should not do; it is coming actually from the population planners who want to advance artificial birth prevention as a matter of Government policy, not only in this country but throughout the world. If Hunianae Vitae should in fact prove to have been in fluential in curbing this totali tarian trend, that will be to its credit. History will then record the encyclical as defense of the freedom of married couples, including those couples whose con sciences command them to re frain from artificial birth prevention out of respect for the dignity of new human life and the integrity of conjuga love. (The Rev.) BRUCE A. WILLIAMS St. John's University Jamaica, N. Y., July 22 1970 • Overnight Parking To the Editor: As a simple and immediate source of revenue for New York City, use should be made of city‐owned day‐time parking areas for overnight off‐street parking on a pay basis. Ex amples: the Metropolitan Mu seum of Art parking area; those outside the Museum of Natural History and the Brooklyn Mu seum. Each of these is located in high‐density middle‐class areas. Nearby residents would gladly accept this opportunity to guarantee car safety in these crowded areas. Street parking would be eased appreciably. Operation costs would he nominal: one or two overnight attendants in each place. Park ing would be on a monthly basis, from 6:30 P.M. to 8:30 A.M. Cars not removed after that time would be charged an illegal parking penalty costly enough to discourage people from just leaving cars in park ing spots in daytime. As a start, one area could be operated as a pilot. After one or two months of opera tion, an expanded improved program could go into effect in other areas. The ones I have mentioned above are only some of the total number of city owned facilities that could be used. It would be a simple mat ter to survey other possibilities and put unused space to rev enue‐earning use for the city. Julius RASKIN Brooklyn, July 8, 1970 • To Measure Pollution To the Editor: In these days of high air pollution it seems highly inac curate — and frightening — that the Department of Air Re sources has a so‐called “index” of air pollution using such vague terms as “Good,” “Acceptable,” “Unsatisfactory,” “Unhealthy.” How unsatisfac tory? How unhealthy? This is reasonable since we know about air temperature and hu midity because of numerical calibration. As a matter of urgent public information, we must be told more precisely what is the quality of air we are attempting to breathe in New York City. AL FRED GESCH EIDT New York, July 27, 1970 • For Four Parties To the Editor: Rather than suffer the dis astrous consequences of in creasing two‐way polarization, the United States might have its socio‐political views best expressed through four political parties. These would be the Radical Left, encompassing disillusioned campus and revolutionary mi nority groups; the Democratic party, returning to the tenets of its non‐Southern leaders in the 1940's and 1950's; a New Center party, bringing together liberal Republicans and the mil lions of moderate independent voters; and the Radical Right, into which conservatives, in cluding Southern racist forces, could be integrated. Despite its quadruped appear ance (which might amuse some exponents of European polit ical systems), this arrangement would let the Democratic and New Center parties maintain in ternal order and resume their traditional, moderate political rivalry. National leadership would likely be won by one of the two, while extremists would be free to vent their spleens in their own radical parties and be less likely to create such disruptions as be fell the Democratic party at its 1968 Chicago convention. If there is to be disorder in much of our national life, let us at least insure order in po litical organizations, so that citizens in or near the Center, who hopefully still represent a national majority, can effec tively be heard.

Egypt's Birth‐Control Program Is Found to Have Limited Effect,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/02/archives/egypts-birthcontrol-program-is-found-to-have-limited-effect.html,"CAIRO, July 28—The fecundity of Egypt is visible in every street and alley, teeming with children and pregnant women. It is estimated that 3,000 babies are born every day and that the population, now nearly 34 million, will reach 45 million by 1980. The country's landreclamation program can hardly keep up with it. “We do not talk to the women about population control,” said Mrs. Aziza Hussein, a pioneer of the movement “We talk about happy families.” The program in fact has not yet made much dent in the demographic explosion, according to Dr. Ibrahim Samaha, a volunteer working in a faded annex of the old Abdin Mosque. He estimated that half a ?? Egyptian women were using contraceptives after a four year campaign but that much more could have been accomplished had the effort been better organized. Criticizes Midwives “Midwives give us a lot of trouble,” he reported. “They spread stories about the pill and the loop. One of those women waiting out there has a phobia about cancer, for example.” Miss Hait Abdel Fadil a young social worker who has been working with the program for six months, finds the work interesting but often discouraging, she confessed. With posters, house visits and word‐of‐mouth propaganda, she has been getting about 40 mothers a month to start taking the pill but about 20 a month drop out. Many quit when the Government switched from providing a pill that costs about 20 cents for a month's supply to one that cost only half as much. It made the mistake of changing the color at the same time and the women, most of them illiterate, turned to druggists to buy the old kind at a much higher price. Some Abandon Pill. “Women abandon the pill altogether,” said Miss Abdel Fadil, “either because a child has died and they want another, or because the marriage has broken up or because their husbands ?? on it or because they are afraid people will think they are sterile.” Now and then, she said, an unmarried woman will come in and ask for pills for her mother or a friend. Advised that nobody may be served without medical examination, they go away and do not return. “One reason people have been fighting the pill,” Miss Abdel Fadil explained, “is that they are afraid it will encourage illicit relations That is why there is no sex education in the schools, too.” “That is why there are illegal abortions,” Mrs. Hussein chimed in. “But that is also why we avoid talking about legal abortion and sterilization.” Mrs. Hussein a leading clubwoman and wife of a ?? Ambassador to the United States, is one of the founders of the family‐planning movement here. She said that it had been a long fight that was only on the verge of major gains. Birth Control Permissible A small feminist movement only half a century old has freed urban Egyptian women from the veil, she pointed out. The very poor in the countryside always worked in the fields unveiled, but even today some landowners keep their women veiled or shut in behind lattices — as a sign of their wealth. But progress could not be denied. A women's college was established in 1927; now even Al Azhar, the Moslem theological university has women's school. A religious board at Al Azhar ruled in 1953 that birth control was permissible if used primarily to space out pregnancies; not all the imams in the local mosques are yet convinced, but the idea has gained ground. “There has been a drastic change in attitudes,” Mrs. Hussein said. “It used to be embarrassing for a woman to walk in the street, alone or with man. Twenty years ago you would not find an Egyptian woman working in a store. Now college graduates are teachers, doctors, scientists. They clerk, they work in hotels, they are dancers and actresses.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Portrait Of a Decade,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/02/archives/portrait-of-a-decade-portrait-of-a-decade.html,"THE 1970 census will show that the United States has a population somewhat in excess of 205 million, an increase of about 25 million since the last census was taken in 1960. This will hardly come as a revelation, for sample surveys taken by the Bureau of the Census since the last complete count provide an accurate annual record of broad changes in the American population. The question has even been raised as to whether the nation might not dispense with a laborious head count every 10 years and substitute the cheaper and actually more reliable sample surveys to keep track of population growth and change. However, only a complete count can provide the detailed knowledge of individual states, counties, cities and smaller areas desired by many users of the census for political, commercial and scientific purposes. Indeed the primary reason for taking a census as prescribed by the Constitution is to discover shifts in the population of Congressional districts before reapportioning seats in the House of Representatives. When the results of the 1970 census are finally tabulated and submitted to Congress in roughly eight months, they will doubtless contain a few surprises—perhaps the kind of unexpected finding produced by special censuses of Los Angeles and Cleveland in 1965. Those studies disclosed that the districts of Watts and Hough had experienced net losses of population since 1960 and that an insignificant number of new arrivals had come to Watts and Hough from outside the Los Angeles and Cleve land metropolitan areas. Since both sections were the scenes of black rioting in the middle sixties, the conventional association of urban racial tensions with heavy black in‐migration and resultant overcrowding obviously must be qualified. Even though the census Is likely to disclose little that is not already known about the broad outlines of recent population changes, coming as it does at the end of one decade and the beginning of another, it provides the full demographic context in which to locate the major events of the recent past and suggests the limits framing future social, economic and political trends. Our tendency to “periodize” American history into decades, each with its distinctive flavor, has no doubt been accentuated by the fact that censuses have been taken in all years ending in zero since 1790, though perhaps the founding fathers instituted the practice because they were also prone to the periodizing habit. THE nineteen‐sixties are generally regarded as a particularly troubled and turbulent decade. And for perhaps the very first time in American history, the turbulence is widely believed to have resulted, at least in part, from the sheer growth of the population. Thus, rather more significance than usual is likely to be attributed to the 1970 census figures on the size, growth and growth rate of the population. In the past the continuing growth of the American population has been viewed with indifference or complacency when “bigger” has not actually been equated with “better.” Today, however, fears are widely expressed that population increase Is the fundamental cause of our major social problems and that America is at last approaching, if it has not already arrived at, a condition of overpopulation. Concern over pollution and the ecological crisis is invariably linked to the pressures of continuing population growth. “Zero Population Growth” clubs have been created at some colleges. Several major political figures who have passed the Vietnam test (otherwise they would hardly be on campus) have been booed by student audiences for “copping out” when they have refused to commit themselves to laws restricting all couples to no more than two children. The proponents of a number of popular causes, initially espoused on a variety of moral and ideological grounds, frequently appeal to the specter of overpopulation as an addi tional argument on their behalf. Equal salaries and wages for women, liberalized abortion laws, tighter marriage laws and easier divorce laws, the distribution of contraceptives to coeds, greater tolerance of homosexuality, communal living arrangements to replace the traditional family, even the fears of genocide expressed by black militants have been justified with references to the “runaway” growth of the American population. When I recently suggested at a campus symposium that alarm over population growth was excessive and that there were perhaps more immediately effective ways of combating environmental deterioration than prohibiting births, another panelist —a former editor of Ramparts, no less—accused me of gross irresponsibility, to the applause of the audience. The gist of my speech was that the population problems of the United States stemmed largely from population redistribution—in effect, from the “urban explosion”—rather than from sheer growth, in contrast to the nations of the Third World, where the need for eliminating rapid growth was a primary one if they were to achieve substantial economic prog My critic, who announced that he had difficulty restraining his temper while listening to me, maintained that my distinction between the situation of the United States and that of the overcrowded countries of the Third World reflected an “obsolete nationalism” if not “imperialism.” He went on to cite scarifying figures on the worldwide per capita consumption of resources and the increased strain on them from every addition of a new child to the population. As I pointed out in my rejoinder, his vague and apocalyptic prophecies of worldwide famine and collapse before the end of the century omitted any reference to the decline of the birth rate in America (and elsewhere) or to the reduction in desired family size reported by contemporary American women in recent surveys. He obviously felt that it was complacent of me at best and immoral at worst even to differentiate descriptively between the demographic condition of the United States and that of the Third World. What the census will show about us in the turbulent sixties Later, an earnest young woman announced that she intended to contribute to a better world by refusing to bear more than one child, by selling her car and taking up hitchhiking and by giving up the use of detergents. She was congratulated by one of the speakers for truly “living her politics.” To what extent will the results of the census provide support for these fears? The answer, unfortunately, is unlikely to be clear‐cut. The population increase of 25 million since 1960 is the second largest between censuses in the history of the nation, surpassed only by a jump of nearly 29 million in the nineteen‐fifties. But viewed in relation to the population base from the preceding census, the increase in the sixties comes to just under 14 per cent, which—although it is nearly double the 7.2 per cent increase in the Depression ‐ridden thirties—is the second lowest intercensal increase on record. By 1969 the average increase of the American population was about 1 per cent a year, or less than half the world rate. These figures unmistakably confirm that the “baby boom” of the nineteen‐forties and fifties, to which many of the alarmists are belatedly reacting, has come to an end. Yet the lower rates of increase are still well above zero, and the ever‐growing size of the base population makes the apparently moderate growth rates somewhat deceptive if we translate the percentages into numbers of people added to the population each year or each decade. (It's like the compound‐interest formula on sav CENSUSES, which give us snapshot pictures of the size and composition of the population once every 10 years, cannot by themselves provide information on the continuous changes the population undergoes as a result of births, deaths, immigration and emigration. The key to changes in the growth rate in the United States, as in other relatively advanced industrial countries, is the trend of the birth rate, which is determined by relating the number of births recorded by the National Office of Vital Statistics in a given period to a base population derived from the most recent census. The slower rate of increase of the American population in the sixties reflects a decline of the birth rate that began in 1957. Yet the present age distribution of the population indicates that proportionately larger numbers of people, and specifically of women, will enter the age groups from which parents are recruited in the seventies than in the early sixties. These potential parents are, of course, the products of the “baby boom” after World War II. For example, infants born in 1957, the all‐time banner year for American births, reached the age of 13 by 1970 and can be expected to have commenced reproducing themselves by 1980. The sheer numbers now entering the par ental ages, a consequence of the high fertility of the fifties, will raise the birth rate in the decade to come even if these young people elect to have fewer children per capita than their parents had. Thus, the concern over a continued population increase is justified for the immediate future. However, the very depth and extent of this concern, particularly on college campuses, suggests a disposition on the part of those voicing it to avoid the “moderate‐sized”—that is, three‐or four ‐child—families of the fifties. The enormous power of the mass media combined with the exposure of larger numbers of young people to the culture of the campus make it altogether possible that decisions on family size and the spacing of children will be directly influenced by fears of overpopulation before the more painful consequences of expanding numbers are actually experienced. A zero rate of population growth, therefore, appears within the range of possibility before the end of the century, if not by the end of the just as forecasts of “incipient population decline” continued to be advanced by demographers and other observers in the nineteen‐forties after the rise in fertility was well under way, so the present concern about overpopulation comes after a trend toward smaller families has become manifest. The American crude birth rate (the number of births per thousand population) in 1968 was the lowest ever recorded, even lower than in the Depression. No doubt the very rapid dissemination of “the pill” in the early sixties greatly increased general awareness of the degree to which family size is subject to personal choice. And with the widespread belief in a direct connection between population growth and environmental damage, the choice is readily converted into a moral issue, a matter of social conscience. Americans have used contraception to restrict the number of children they produce for nearly a century, but the invention of new and immensely effective contraceptive methods together with alarm over the effects of burgeoning population on the environment and the “quality of life” may for the first time have made total population growth consideration influencing the child‐bearing decisions of millions of people. Nor are current anxieties about the medical effects of the pill likely to counteract this new awareness, for alternative contraceptive methods remain available. The American birth rate, in fact, began its decline several years before the mass marketing of the pill and even more years before intra‐uterine devices (I.U.D.'s) became IN spite of the concern over the increase in the total number of Americans, the United States remains relatively sparsely populated, ranking behind Britain, Switzerland, Mexico and the Philippines—none of them considered strikingly overcrowded—in population density, or the average number of persons per square mile. The impression of overcrowding in the United States gains plausibility less from the over‐all increase in numbers than from the growing concentration of people in certain regions, states and communities. In the nineteen‐sixties, as in the past, internal migration made an important, though reduced, contribution to changes in the distribution of the American population. Migration, moreover, has a “multiplier effect”: because most migrants are young adults, they raise the birth rate of the areas to which they move and lower it in the areas they vacate. California gained about 3.7 million people in the sixties, more than twice the roughly 1.5 million gained by Texas and New York, while Nevada, Arizona and Alaska showed the largest percentage increases among the states. Five states — North and South Dakota, Mississippi, West Virginia and Wyoming — experienced sufficiently large net out ‐migrations to result in sriiall population declines. In general, the West and the Southwest continued to attract migrants from the rest of the country, while the North Central region suffered net out ‐migration. Between 1960 and 1968 fully one out of every three counties in the United States actually lost Most of these counties were in a belt reaching from the agricultural Middle West southward to Texas and Louisiana and eastward across the South to Georgia and South Carolina, and most of them have been losing population ever since the thirties. Nearly half of all counties lost population in the fifties. The drop to one‐third in the sixties reflects a general slowing up of migration. These facts sharply contradict prevalent visions of the inexorable filling up of the open spaces as a result of a population explosion. Actually, there is more open space in the United States today than there was a generation ago, and—even allowing for uninhabitable desert and mountain areas that were once rangeland or sites of mining towns—much of it is actual or potential farmland in the midof The most consequential changes of location made by Americans are movements from rural areas and small towns and cities to metropolitan areas. The “urban explosion,” rather than a general “population explosion,” produces or contributes to the traffic jams, the clogging of transportation facilities, the strain on public services, air and water pollution and the defilement and disappearance of open countryside which create the sense of crisis and claustrophobia felt these days by so many Americans. the growth of the urban population since the twenties, and especially since World War II, has been in the suburban rings outside the central cities. The Bureau of the Census now distinguishes in its tabulations between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas, the latter including both farm and nonfarm residents of what were formerly called “rural areas” as well as all residents of cities and towns of less than 50,000. The shifts of population from nonmetropolitan to metropolitan areas, between metropolitan areas and from central cities to suburbs within metropolitan areas constitute the major changes in American population distribu THE sixties witnessed a continuation of the trends of the fifties, but at a slower rate. Metropolitan areas grew more rapidly than the national population, but their growth was greatest in the suburbs. The over‐all metropolitan rate of growth was roughly 14.5 per cent, as compared with 26.5 per cent in the fifties, a growth rate about 2 per cent higher than that of the population as a whole. Just under two‐thirds of our population now lives in metropolitan areas. The metropolitan growth was concentrated in the suburbs, which increased by 26.5 per cent, as compared with a growth rate of 49 per cent for the fifties. By the end of the sixties, central cities had replaced nonmetropolitan areas as the slowest‐growing areas. Their increase was only 1.3 per cent, and such cities as Buffalo, Cleveland, Des Moines, Louisville, New Haven and Rochester were shown to have lost population by spe cial censuses taken since 1960. The 1970 census will undoubtedly disclose similar declines in many more cities. The suburbs and the real or alleged characteristics of suburbanites received a lot of attention, mostly unfavorable, from sociologists and social critics in the fifties. Although the movement to the suburbs continued throughout the sixties, attention shifted to the problems of the central cities and the economic plight of their residents. The reason, of course, is primarily race: the growing concentration of Negroes in the central cities, replacing white migrants to the suburbs and becoming a larger proportion of the city population when whites move out. Which trend—black inmigration or white out‐migration—predominated in specific cities will not be ascertainable until the detailed tabulations of the new census become By 1969, however, more than half of the total Negro population, 55.2 per cent, lived in central cities. Washington, D. C., was still the only large city with more Negroes (69 per cent) than whites, but in Newark the population was almost evenly divided, and the proportion of blacks in the populations of Baltimore, New Orleans, Memphis and Atlanta was estimated at 40 per cent or slightly more in the late sixties. Except for Newark, the only Northern city close to 40 per cent was Detroit, which had 39 per cent. Perhaps the racial battleground will shift back to the South in the decade ahead, but this time it is likely to be centered in the urban South. The gross changes since 1960 in the distribution of the Many have seen the 60's as a crucial transition period races by residence were not, however, as great as they are often believed to have been. The proportion of the total white population living in central cities declined between 1960 and 1969 by about 4 per cent (from 30 to 25.8), while the suburban proportion went up by 5 per cent (from 33.1 to 38); the proportion of the total black population in central cities increased by nearly 4 per cent (from 51.5 to 55.2) and in the suburbs by just over 1 per cent (from 13.2 to 14.7). Since 1966 the central cities have been losing an average of half a million persons a year, the result of a net white out‐migration exceeding the growth of the black population. One‐third of the black increase is a result of net in‐migration, the remainder of natural increase (the excess of births over deaths). As these figures indicate, the trend toward racial polarization between the cities and the suburbs, which became clearly established nearly 30 years ago, continues relentlessly in spite of widespread alarm and policies Yet since 1968 there have appeared for the first time signs of a sharply accelerated movement of Negroes to the suburbs, especially the inner suburbs, along with a decline in the rate of growth of black populations in central cities. The numbers involved are still small, but the new trend may be significant. What its continuation might imply for future race relations is uncertain. It could reduce the polarization of white suburbs and black cities, but it could also extend the pattern of polarization outward from the central city to embrace the inner suburban rings as well. THE findings of the new census on the situation of Negroes, especially on social and economic differentials between whites and Negroes, are likely to receive closer and more critical scrutiny than any of its other conclusions. Even the taking of the census and the procedures followed have become a sensitive issue. A few black militant groups urged their followers to refuse to answer the census takers’ questions, but a far larger number of black leaders counseled cooperation, promoted the slogan “it pays to be counted” and promised vigilance in overseeing the performance of the Bureau of the Census to insure a full and honest count. Sensitive to charges of underenumeration of Negroes, the bureau was determined this year to avoid any repetition of the 1960 census, in which, according to its own estimate, as many as 14 per cent of all Negro males (as against only 2 per cent of white males) were not counted. But since the new census was taken at the end of March, there have been complaints from black community groups that many blacks in the big‐city slums were missed again or were unable to complete the mail ¶uestionnaire sent to residents of large metropolitan areas. The tabulation of the census has, in fact, been delayed while the bureau investigates these and other complaints. The issue is crucial because the poorest and most deprived blacks are the most likely to be missed. The statistics would therefore falsely upgrade the socio‐economic status of Negroes and understate their relative disadvantages vis‐à‐vis whites. Such errors would, of course, be magnified in districts with large black populations. However, even if substantial underenumeration of poor urban Negroes is avoided—or if it is generally believed to have been avoided—the census reports on the condition of Negroes are certain to be subject to varying and conflicting interpretations. During the sixties the Bureau of the Census, in collaboration with the Bureau of Labor Statistics, issued periodic reports on the characteristics of the Negro population. The most recent of these, “The Social and Economic Status of Negroes in the United States, 1969,” has attracted some attention from public officials, journalists and social scientists. Its findings will be checked against the more exhaustive and detailed breakdowns of the complete census. This 1969 report showed that Negroes were, as they had been in 1960, about 11 per cent of the population. Their fertility rates were somewhat higher than those of whites, but had followed the same upward and downward movements since 1950. Fifty‐five per cent of all Negroes still lived in the South, an 8 per cent decline since 1960. Net migration of Ne groes out of the South was still considerable, but continued to decline from the peak volume of the nineteenforties. Negro median family income was, by 1968, 60 per cent of the white level, a 6 per cent increase in the ratio since 1960. In the South, however, Negro income was slightly more than half of white income; in the other regions it ranged from 69 per cent in the Northeast to 80 per cent in the West. In 1968, one‐third of all nonwhite families had incomes of $8,000 or more, as compared with only 15 per cent in 1960; the proportions for whites were 58 per cent in 1968 and 39 per cent in 1960, indicating a slightly higher relative gain for whites. On the other hand, 29 per cent of Negro families had incomes below the poverty line ($3,553 for a nonfarm family of four in 1968) as opposed to only 8 per cent of white families; in 1959 the proportions were 48 per cent for Negroes and 15 per cent for whites. The decline in poverty was somewhat greater The unemployment rate in 1969 for nonwhites was the lowest since the Korean war, but was still double the white rate. Between 1960 and 1969 the percentage of workers in highly skilled occupations increased more rapidly for Negroes and other races than for whites, and nonwhites also experienced a greater decrease in persons employed as laborers, domestic servants and in farm occupations. In spite of large relative gains, nonwhites were still represented in the two most skilled and best paying occupational groups (professionals and managers) by less than half their proportion of the total population. In education, the percentage of Negroes enrolled at every level from nursery school to college increased sharply during the sixties. The percentage of Negro males aged 25 to 29 who had completed four or more years of high school rose from 36 in 1960 to 60 in 1969; the comparable figures I MIGHT go on and summarize data on housing, living conditions and health, the family, military status and voting participation. But they tell a similar story of absolute black gains in all areas, some relatively greater than for whites, others relatively lesser, and the persistence of wide differentials favoring whites in most areas. The fact that the circumstances of blacks have improved, however modestly and starting from what ever low levels, needs stressing because I have found that the presentation of the statistical evidence is greeted by students — and not only by students — with amazement and incredulity. Lacking any historical perspective and having so recently “discov ered” the unfavorable position of blacks in American society, students find it very hard to believe that any progress can have taken place, especially during the years of the iniquitous Vietnam war. Suspicious of statistical abstraction by contrast with “lived experience” and raised in comfortable suburbs where there was little visible evidence of pov “There have appeared signs of an accelerated movement of Negroes to the suburbs... What this implies for race relations is uncertain.” erty or the squalor of black ghettos, they often seem to feel that the sheer existence of the latter refutes any quantitative indications of improvement. There is also the tendency, common to liberals as well as those students who define themselves as radicals, to evaluate the present by the ideal standard of full equality, whereas statistical trends inevitably compare the present with the past. As a result, one finds a strong disposition to dismiss the evidence in toto as an apologia for evil, or even as a pack of selfserving lies put out by the Few of the advances made are remarkable, and the “glass of water” parable clearly applies to them: optimists may declare the glass “half full” while pessimists are at liberty to describe it as “half empty.” Both, of course, are right. One may also select from the statistics to stress for polemical purposes either absolute differences between blacks and whites, relative differences or unequal rates of change in a wide variety of areas. All demographic data lend themselves to such manipulation. From the standpoint of proclaimed aspirations, rhetorical commitments and time and energy — if not money — invested at all levels of government as well as by private organizations in efforts to right the historical injustice of the Negro's position in American society, one may readily conclude that a mountain labored throughout the sixties to bring forth a mouse. Moreover, some gains registered by blacks may owe less to policies adopted than to unplanned consequences of other, possibly transitory, circumstances such as a temporarily favorable age distribution among Negroes or the effects on the economy and on employment of the Viet Yet there have been real gains, and the rate of improvement has quickened. The record hardly indicates total neglect, whether “benign” or otherwise. It is unlikely that the fuller data to be provided by the new census will reverse or even greatly modify this general conclusion. IN general, except for the beginning of a trend toward relative improvement in the position of Negroes in several areas, the demographic profile of the nineteen ‐sixties shows no dramatic reversals of direction either in the overall growth pattern of the American population, in its distribution or in its major social and economic characteristics. Trends that began at the end of the Depression or even earlier in the century continued, though at slower rates. Even the significant decline in fertility commenced, as we have seen, in the late Many people have seen the sixties as a crucial transition decade in American life, whether as the beginning of the decline of the republic or as a breakthrough to a new and hopeful social transformation. The demographic indices, however, reveal no startling changes—in contrast, for instance, to the Depression decade, when most major social and economic trends, even rural‐to‐urban migration, were temporarily reversed. But this is to be expected; population movements have a momentum of their own and change more slowly than our political and cultural responses to the world around us. Often we become aware of and react against the consequences of population trends only when they have already begun, almost imperceptibly, to change. Perhaps the demographic trends of the sixties will be seen in retrospect to have been more of a turning point than is apparent now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Maria knew what ‘nothing’ means,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/09/archives/maria-knew-what-nothing-means-play-it-as-it-lays-play-it.html,"A new novel by Joan Didion is something of an event. Since her first one, “Run River” (1963), she has gathered a quiet following with her nonfiction pieces that were col lected under the title “Slouching Towards Bethlehem” and published to critical enthusiasm, in 1968. It was interesting to wonder what sort of fiction Miss Didion's beautiful writerly skills would now make of her clear‐eyed and anguished per cention of our time. By Joan Didion. 214 pp. New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $5.95. “Play It As It Lays""‐opens in a setting not unfamiliar to the reader of fiction—the mental institution—and with a not unfamiliar piece of wisdom—that the people on the inside are sometimes wiser than the people on the outside. Maria, the anti‐heroine, asks such questions as “What makes Iago evil?""; rather, she no longer asks them but other people still do. “NOTHING APPLIES,” Maria explains in caps, and these same other people ask “what does apply?... as if the word ‘nothing’ were ambiguous, open to interpreta tion.” Maria is an expert on Nothing. By birth she is from nowhere. Silver Wells, Nev., was a place where Maria's father meant to get rich, but they built the freeway elsewhere and “there isn't any Silver Wells today.” Maria describes her education: “An eighteen‐year‐old girl... grad uates from the Consolidated Union High School in Tonopah and goes to New York to take acting lessons, how do you figure it?” Her love life: “I knew a lot of Southerners and faggots and rich boys....” And her marriage: “That was the year I screamed at Ivan and married Carter.” Carter, a movie director who is just beginning to be a success, had once shot a film called simply “Maria” in which the camera followed her through a typical New York day: “Maria doing a fashion sitting, Maria asleep on a couch at a party, Maria arguing with the billing de partment at Bloomingdale's, Maria cleaning some marijuana with a kit chen strainer, Maria crying in the IRT.” When Carter gives his impres sion of her a few years later, he de scribes two occasions when she spoke or acted incoherently; the point is, he has not drawn the conclusion of his own movie: What, in a meaningless world, is coherent? The main part of the book follows Maria on that downward path to wisdom: “I know something Carter never knew... or maybe you. I know what ‘nothing’ means.” The setting is Movieville, Cal. We have met the burnt‐out cases that inhabit it in fiction before, but not often as sharply observed or elegant ly written down. “Heaven pajamas,” Maria's friend Helene's friends say to one ,another. “BZ, you've planned this to torment me,” says Helene's homosexual husband's homosexual friend. “You couldn't possibly buy artificial lemon juice, someone left it here, it's a bad joke.” Later Helene talks about her hairdresser “Leon ard's in New York for ten days... I don't mind if I'm out of town, but if I'm in town and Leonard's not—who was that on the telephone?” How does Maria deal with her own disintegration? By distraction: every morning by ten she is on the freeway driving at high speed “which absorbed all her reflexes, all her attention.” By denying that things are falling apart: “She tried always to let the [gas station] attendant notice her putting the [coke] bottle in the rack, a show of thoughtful responsibility.” She covers herself with a fog of drugs. In this fog Maria goes through the motions of continuing her life. She tends her acting career (consisting of the two films, one never distrib uted, made by her husband). She goes to parties “with an occasional faggot... never a famous faggot.” She goes to bed with whoever asks her, has an affair with a friend's husband (not out of passion but the need to hud die) and becomes pregnant. There is an abortion. “The floor of the bedroom where it happened was covered with newspapers.” While the doctor scrapes, Maria (or rather Miss Didion) subtly deduces the wo man who furnished the place with “a white chenille bed spread and a white Princess telephone... a purchaser of Audubon prints and scented douches, a hoarder of secret sexual grievances, a wife.” There is a hypnotist. There is an attempted reconciliation with Carter on location in the desert. It runs its predictable course through the old disaffec tion and violence. There is a realignment of sex partners. Maria holds the hand of BZ who has also discovered “the meaning of nothing”—while he kills himself, and she ends up in a mental home. For Maria “The meaning of nothing” is that “nothing adds up""; she experiences it as mediocrity, nastiness, violence, physical illness and “waves of dread,” and it leads her to a paralysis of the emotions and the will. Henry James, in another generation, could put a body on the idea of the absence of feeling, the inability or unwil lingness to experience; he made a Beast in the Jungle leap from behind the tomb of unconsummated love. Though Joan Didion alludes to Yeats's apocalyptic best “slouching towards Bethlehem” in the title of her collected essays, Yeats's expression of grief at the im minent disconnection of things now seems as archaic as the image of “the falcon” and “the falconer” he uses. In the world where we live with Miss Didion and Maria, the center already has collapsed. Didn't Maria know? In Miss Didion's case it is impertinent impertinent than usual for the critic to deduce the writer from her creature, because in her essays she chooses to speak in her own person. From these we know that she has given herself the task of interpreting and coming to terms with the period of time which has pro duced Maria; but one of the victims of this time is the writer of novels. The trouble with this book is the nothing inside Maria. If novelists have discovered that the literary con vention of describing people in terms of fixed characteristics no longer rings true, it does not follow there is nothing there. The problem is how to write people till someone comes up with a new convention. But the trouble with Miss Didion's novel is more radical. In the preface to her essays she says that she has some times been “paralyzed by the conviction that writing is an irrelevant act.” Her new book feels as if it were written out of an insufficient impulse by a writer who doesn't know what else to do with all that talent and skill. It is a very good talent. There is a high intelligence in her observations and her con nections. She uses the language with the ease, control and vir tuosity that comes from na tural grace and hard work. When Maria speaks of her little daughter with an unspecified mental imbalance, whose fair hair tangles at the institution where she's kept because they don't brush it regularly, what might have been sentimental is moving and true. But else where it is just because Miss Didion's words ring so clearly and subtly that every false note sounds out. To use an other metaphor: her prose tends to posture like a figure from a decadent period of art, whose fingers curl toward an exposed heart or draped bosom swelling with suspect emotion. In our day the finger points straight groinward, but it isn't the direction that matters. It is the insistence that makes us suspect Joan Didion's own lack of faith in what she is writing, and puts her book in that heartbreaking category—a bad novel by a very good writer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The First Family Of Conservatism,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/09/archives/the-first-family-of-conservatism-about-candidate-jim-columnist-bill.html,"SHARON, Conn. MEMORANDUM to the Buckley Children: I have been much con cerned of tate with the apparent in ability of any of you, at any time: to go anywhere on foot, although I am sure your mother would have informed me if any of you had been born without the walking capacity of a normal human being, A. few of the older children, not ably Priscilla, occasionally walk a few hundred yards behind a golf ball, but all the others “exercise” exclusively by sitting on a horse or a sailboat. Concurrently, I have noticed that the roads around Sharon are crowd ed with Buckley, cars at all hours of the day and night, and it has been years since any of you has been able to get as far as the Town Clock, much less the Post Office, without a car, or if under 16, a car and a chauffeur. All the cars are left out every night in all kinds of weather, un doubtedly because of the dangerous fatigue involved in walking from the garage to the house. I think that each of you should consider a course of therapy de signed to prevent atrophy of the leg muscles if only for aesthetic reasons, or you might even go to the ex treme of attempting to regain the art of walking, by easy stages of course. The cars might then be re served for errands covering dis tances of over 50 yards or so. Affectionately, Father FATHER was William F. Buck ley Sr., and for years, even long after. the 10 Buckley children, became adults, his memos, often addressed to all his children to avoid particular embarrassment to any one of them, overlooked few, if any, areas of their lives. The memos encouraged self application, self‐reliance, religious faith, education, cultivation, prompt debt‐paying and good mariners. They reprimanded nicotine addic tion, sloppy handwriting, long side burns, any form of laziness and the slightest display of unreliabillity Humor and teasing were frequent weapons‐in the memos,—but always they were written with great ten derness and with the assurance of a man who had no question about his authority over his children. The memos came to the family estates in Sharon and Camden, S. C., to prep schools, colleges, temporary European addresses — wherever a Buckley child happened to be. Buck ley Sr. sent the memos from;hotels, trains or apartments in Spain, Carac as, Paris or London—wherever he happened to be in his latest exploit as a Texas‐lawyer‐turned‐independ ent‐oilman. Business kept Buckley away from home much of the time, but if his absence was certain to be as long as a school term, he took the children with him and, if not, his attention, via the memos, was felt almost as keenly as his very presence. Like Joseph Kennedy, Buckley said that everything he did in his career —the gambles he took, the monu mental hassles with governments and oil companies, the enemies he made—was for his family, and if a man failed in that, he failed in everything. RARELY, as they are happy to mention, do the Buckleys play touch football, but there are certain in escapable similarities between them and the Kennedys. Both are large Irish‐Catholic clans with tenacious loyalty to their own and to their church, and both were brought up by demanding and controversial fathers who built fortunes so that they could offer their children all the ad vantages they did not have. Both of the founding fathers grew up see ing themselves as outsiders in so ciety, Kennedy as the son of a saloon‐owning politician in Boston, Buckley as the son of a Catholic sheep rancher in Baptist cattle‐coun try in Texas. The fundamental difference be tween the visions of these men, it seems, is that Kennedy was con vinced he deserved to be accepted by society and that one of his children, if not he himself, would offer the final proof by becoming President. With the same fierce pride, Buckley was convinced that society was not deserving of acceptance and that his children, who had no need to prove anything to anyone, should merely be right. So Kennedy set about master ing the compromises of public life, while Buckley spent much energy railing against them. His children would always stand on “principle.” After Buckley died of a stroke in 1958, at the age of 77, his children published an engaging book about their father, “W. F. B.—An Apprecia tion,” and circulated 1,500 copies privately. With great reverence, but also with his own extraor dinary humor, they and family friends told the stories about his oil business, his religious faith and, most important, his family. “There was nothing complicated about father's theory of child rearing,” begins the chapter on his memos. “He brought up his sons and daughters with the quite simple objective that they become absolutely perfect.” A FEW months ago, the entire family gathered at Great Elm, the 40‐acre Sha ron estate about 90 miles from New York City, to cele brate their mother's 75th birth‐Clay. Present were four sons, four daughters, and six in‐laws, including the widow ers of two deceased daugh ters—altogether, the parents of 49 Buckley grandchildren. “I was so happy,” says Mrs. Aloise Buckley, a tiny and energetic lady from a New. Orleans family, with a heri tage of good old Lee blood and more than a little sus picion of Yankees. “I just can't tell you what fun it was,” she adds, a trace of the Southern accent still de tectable. Naturally, it was a typical old ‐fashioned conservative Buckley family evening, with lots of good wine, good food, piano playing (William Sloane Coffin, who disagrees with them about almost every thing, once visited the home and remarked later, “As long as they're on Mozart and Bach, they're great”), jokes and anecdotes, all sprinkled nonchalantly with foreign languages, five‐syllable words and quotations from the Bible, Greek poets, French philosophers anyone re markable, in fact, from Day One to Norman Mailer and Tom Wolfe. For the most part, the Buckleys stick together, even in ideology. Buckley Sr. was immensely successful in con veying to his children his suspicions of compromise, governments and liberals. Without exception, the fam ily members consider them selves conservatives and, in the style of their father, they prefer to locate themselves somewhere near the center of culture and the margins of politics, standing on their principles and hurling their wit and bons mots at the silliness they see around them. In this they can be, at times, as hard on the right as on the left. Long ago, Wil Ham F. Buckley Jr's National Review exorcised the John Birch Society from the ranks of what the magazine con siders “the responsible right.” (For months, Bill received ‘more hate mail from the right than from the left.) And re cently, when Texas billion aire H. L. Hunt had the audac ity to suggest that perhaps Bill has some “pinko” tend encies, Bill responded by ex plaining to a Miami reporter that surely Hunt was the kind of man Whittaker Chambers must have had in mind when he once noted that the stupid ity of much of the right is what causes many to sym pathize with the left. OF the family, William F. Buckley Jr. is the best known, which has been so since “God and Man at Yale,” written immediately after he graduated, struck the nation's academic community like a lightning bolt from heaven itself. (The book argued, that the ultraliberalism taught by some ‘faculty members was eroding religion and economic individualism at Yale—and that the university should seek more actively to imbue its students with these tradi tional values.) Perhaps only coincidentally, Bill was the only son Buckley Sr. encour aged to enter public life. “I have the feeling that you will inevitably be drawn into politics, or alternatively cata pult yourself into this field,” father wrote son after “God and Man” was published. “What this country needs is a politician who has an edu cation, and I don't know of one. There hasn't been an educated man in the Senate or House of Representatives since Sumner of Texas quit in disgust three or four years ago.” Since “God and Man,” Buckley has established him self as probably the most in fluential (and certainly the most interesting) conservative writer in America, with the possible exception of Spiro Agnew himself. Buckley's friend Richard Nixon makes a point of reading his column; after Nixon's Nov. 3 Vietnam speech, Henry Kissinger was immediately on the phone to ask Bill's assessment. Nixon has also appointed Bill as a member of the select (Frank Stanton, presi dent of C.B.S., et al.) five man board of advisers to the U.S.I.A. Naturally, it didn't take Bill long to start lobby ing for more conservative books in Government libraries overseas. The resulting out rage among some liberal: amused him. “Most of the critics of this move,” he ob served, “consider that the spectrum of American polit ical thought runs from Schlesinger to Galbraith.” Bill has also, along the way, run his earning power right off the chart for work ing journalists. He declines to identify the exact six fig ures, but his TV program goes to nearly 100 stations, his column is syndicated in 315 papers (second among political columnists only to Jack Anderson's), his lectures bring him $2,000 per, his magazine articles appear in everything from Rudder to Esquire, and his book royal ties are substantial. AT the moment, his book of letters from Whittaker Chambers, one of the few men besides Buckley Sr., to deeply influence Bill, has shown Chambers to be a much more complex and literary man than his critics had previously realized. Two more Buckley books were published last month—“Have You Ever Seen a Dream Walk ing?,” a textbook of 20th century American conserva tive thought, and “The Gov ernor Listeth,” a book, ac cording to Bill's subtitle, “Of Inspired Political Revela tions.” Buckley himself inspires strong reactions, whether ex pressed as epithets or admi ration. The former editor of a liberal Catholic magazine who, rather against his will, is fond of Bill, once explain ed that in dealing with him, a person has to make a basic decision: Do you agree with him and therefore like him? Easy. Or do you disagree with him and therefore dislike him? Again, easy. Or, as is more often the case with a group that includes John Kenneth, Galbraith, Max Ler ner and any number of liberal journalists, do you disagree with him, sometimes to the point of infuriation, and stilt Feel an affection for him? The quandary is not unlike that of the New Left student A Columbia who got to know one of the villainous univer sity deans and confessed, with great frustration, “What can I do? I liked him.” Bill causes this dilemma by very simple style. His col imns have the virtue of being entertaining, but they are ilso unyielding and, at times, trident. His public debates an become bitter—witness, for instance, the infamous Vidal‐Buckley fiasco.* In private, he is unfailingly thoughtful, friendly, generous and fun‐loving. For a polem icist, his private corre spondence with ideological opponents is unusual in its ex tensiveness and unique, sure ly, in its good‐natured humor. Buckley has, in fact, been accused of preferring the com pany of liberals, who often seem to enjoy his own joie de vivre more than some stuffy conservatives. “I feel I qualify spiritually and philosophically as a conservative,” he once said, “but temperamentally I am not of the breed.” His friend, the liberal Cath olic editor, offers an explana tion: “I'm convinced that he's fighting as a leader of what he considers a trapped minor ity, so he's willing to do some things that are uncon genial to his basic friendly nature. It's as though he's in uniform while in public and is willing, like a soldier, to do whatever has to be done. Then he takes off the uniform and you have the friendly guy who'll grant you points, merry and relaxed, and who would never dream of hurting some one's feelings. The key to un derstanding him is that his public hostility is to the ideas, not to the people.” When Bill was 15, he none theless managed to concern even his father with his jar ring sharpness. “In thinking over my letter to you it may have appeared very critical,” Buckley Sr. wrote in a memo. “Your mother and I like very much your attitude of having strong convictions and of not being too bashful to express them. What I meant was that you would have to learn to be more moderate in the ex pression of your views and try to express them in a way that would give as little of fense as possible to your friends.” As others have noted, it was one of the few *The animosity between the two dates back to remarks Vidal made about Buckley on the Jack Paar Show in 1962. Of their encounters since then, one might charitably say, well, only very little. After a television debate, “moderated” by David Suss kind, at the 1964 Republican convention, one critic wrote: “Susskind was a zoo keeper trying to prevent two hissing adders from killing each other.” That confrontation seemed like an exchange of pleasantries in comparison with a rematch at the 1968 Democratic convention, when Vidal called Buckley a “cryp to‐Nazi” on TV and Buckley retorted: “Shut up or I'll smash you in the goddam mouth, you queer!” Then, the two traded, at great pieces of his father's advice that Bill ever ignored. Bill and his wife, Pat, own the East 73d Street apartment that used to belong to Dag Hammarskjold, but they spend as much time as pos sible at their home on the shore at Stamford. Conn., where Bill indulges himself sailing, painting, playing the piano (Well) and singing (badly, but with great vigor). Pat is a Canadian who met Bill when she roomed with a *length, some truly surpassing nastiness in the pages of Es quire, for which Buckley is now suing both Vidal and the magazine, and Vidal has lodged a counterclaim against Buckley. Among Buckley's charges is that Vidal implied Buckley took part in the van dalism of a Sharon Episcopal church some 26 years ago, when, in fact, the participants were three Buckley sisters and their friends. To this day, strangers frequently stop Buckley to express strong feelings about that one televised moment two years ago. When they congratulate him, which is often, it disturbs him. “In front of millions of people I lost my temper,” he says. “And they admire it. Can you imagine?” Buckley daughter at Vassar. Tall, dark, strikingly attrac tive, strong‐minded and, when she wants to be, im periously intimidating, she was viewed by the family when she married Bill, Buck ley Sr. wrote on the eve of the wedding, as the weapon to accomplish what “Billy's brothers and sisters... have failed to do, and that is to beat Billy into submission.” Protesting for their prin ciples has always been just behind communion in the priorities of the family's con science—thus Bill's race for Mayor of New York in 1965 and his brother. Jim's race for the Senate. (1,100,000 votes) in 1968. Given those priorities, it is easier to un derstand the Buckleys’ seem ing indifference to the imme diate political consequences of draining off conservative votes and aiding those to whom they are most opposed. In 1921, to cite the family's most extreme case of stubbornness, Buckley Sr. was expelled from Mexico as a “pernicious for eigner.” The charge was that he was fomenting a revolution against the Obreg6n govern ment, and‐his expulsion cost him properties then worth more than $1‐million. He re turned to the States, years be fore other American oil prop erties were expropriated, prac tically flat broke. He later wrote that it would have been easy for him to bribe and ac commodate the revolutionary government, which had over thrown many of the old fam ilies he was fond of, and he knew exactly the penalty for refusing to do so. But given the choice between his prin ciples and his fortune, the family says proudly, he chose his principles. James Buckley, 47 years old, is once again in the race for a Senate seat from New York, but this time he is not merely arguing the principles of the case. The Buckleys fi nally have a serious candidate for political office in the fam ily. Running on the Conserva tive ticket, Jim has persuaded F. Clifton White, perhaps the central figure in engineering the Goldwater Presidential nomination, to play a key role in his campaign, and is out to raise at least $1.5‐million—the minimum he figures necessary for a “competent” and vic torious effort. His scenario for winning be gan after Charles Goodell, whose appointment Jim thought fine at the time, swerved vocally to an antiwar position and, in Jim's view, a generally belligerent posture toward the Nixon Administra tion. “It was the most stun ning conversion since St. Paul took the road to Damascus,” says Jim, so mildly it almost sounds like a compliment. Re publicans, he adds, even some nonconservatives, began tell ing him that there was no choice between Goodell and any of the Democrats, and that Goodell has insulted a lot of Republicans by attack ing the Administration. “So I'm the only one in the field generally sympathetic to Ad ministration policies, and I feel more people in New York are generally pro‐Administra tion than anti‐Administra tion,” he says. There may be, Jim estimates, 35 per cent willing to cast such a general ly pro‐Administration vote which, if the other two candi dates split the remaining 65 per cent evenly, is sufficient to‐give New York a‐conserva  Buckley takes offense at the suggestion that he would be a rubber‐stamp for the Adminis tration. In general, he could be counted upon to support the A.B.M. and Administration” policies in Vietnam, but his idea that only volunteers be sent to Vietnam drew an en thusiastic response even from, Paul O'Dwyer. He is also a hawk on environment, closer to the impatience of the Earth Day kids than to any party. line. About the S.S.T. even—the acid test for a. conserva tive‐conservationist—he is un certain, but at least doesn't flunk the test. “I'd certainly be for slowing this down,” he says, “until we know more about it.” Something of a nature nut himself—a hiker, a country resident who tries to keep his days in the city to three each week, a veteran of two expe ditions to the Canadian Arctic —Buckley feels he established his environment credentials in 1968, before more conven tional politicians started push ing it. “I talked about it so much, even some of my friends accused me of pushing a phony issue,” he says. As a campaigner, Buckley will have considerable appeal for the groups he says he is after—“the center and the right‐of‐center.” He says that of all the Buckley children, he was the one least exposed to the family's European experi ences, and it shows. He is—a term not to be used loose ly —The All‐American Boy, the brave, cheerful, loyal, trustworthy and reverent Boy Scout. And somehow, he still manages to be likable. He‐has a pleasant, boyish face and a graying crewcut. Occasionally, he wears a neat little bowtie. Perhaps the most even‐tem pered man in the state, his air of soft‐spoken sincerity and honesty positively inspires confidence. There is the will ingness, almost eagerness, to listen to—if not be swayed by —the opposite viewpoint. In place of the sharp wit of Bill, there is, simply, quick, but gentle, good‐humor and pa tience. With his wife, Ann, a tall, trim blonde, and their six children, 5 to 16, Buckley liVes in a comfortable but not luxurious home about 200 yardS from the Great Elm‐es tate in Sharon. “Are the chil dren conservatives?” I ask, cleverly. Oh no, here comes a Buckley put‐down, I think, “Given the choice between his principles and his fortune. Buckley‐Sr. chose his principles. ‘We were broke a few times.’ recalls Mrs. 13.99 as he opens his face in a big‐ Buckley smile. I guess you would call the two older boys generalists,” he says. Then: “No, they haven't shown any particular interest in politics.” To Jim, the let down is preferable to the put‐down. The family, to some extent, is asking the same question as the‐liberals: “What will we do if Jim wins?” Not only would there be a tendency for the Buckleys to dissolve in front of such popular ac ceptance, but Jim's talents are badly needed by the family oil company, Cawtawba, of which he‐is vice president. His particular combination of patience and daring; say his brothers and sisters, is the closest in the family to their father's—which, of course, is one of the nicest things Buckley could say about sibling. Since their father's death, the company has been owned in equal parts by all the chil  “You have a whole climate against our sort of closeness” dren. (It is usually reported that, at his death, Buckley Sr held oil properties worth $110‐million. Actually, says the family, he merely held in terests in these assets, which were highly speculative any way, so his real wealth was considerably less. By the time he died, in fact, it was practi cally nothing. In his last years, he managed to give all everything he owned to his wife and children. From the probate of his will, each child received $17.) SINCE 1958, John Buckley, 50, the oldest son, has been president of Cawtawba, which operates with a small staff out of fashionable offices (“Potemkin Village,” John calls them, indicating there is some austerity behind the showcase exterior) on East 37th Street. John is an agree able fellow with an easy laugh, a businessman who can quote Virgil, but who sounds crankier—which is to say qualified even tempera mentally as a conservative—when he complains about Nixon not fulfilling his cam paign promises to “clean out the State Department” and to :liberate Cuba from Castro. A short man with a stomach that just kind of leans out over his belt like it was getting ready to jump, John has had person al problems during the past few years, at one point under going probably the most se vere wrench for a Buckley—he temporarily gave up his church. In 1966, his wife, Ann, then 38, died suddenly of a heart attack and, as John says, “I underwent two years of the most severe unhappi ness. I even lost my faith in God.” He drank too much and is still a chain smoker, but, he says, “I finally real ized if I was ever going to see Ann again, I had to make peace with the church, which I did.” Cawtawba (named after a river in South Carolina), says John, “is the family's weapon for staying alive in a rough business.” As John explains it, the company operates on the same principles as when Buckley Sr. was building (and occasionally losing) fortunes with it. Cawtawba owns large chunks of stock in seven small oil companies around the world. The companies buy land on speculation, then with the help of Cawtawba geolo gists and lawyers negotiate to contract out the drilling work—with royalty rights—to larger but later‐arriving companies. It is all enor mously complicated and, while John runs it, Jim travels about 60,000 miles a year and spends about one‐fourth of his time in Asia, Australia and Canada. But the opera tion is too speculative, says John, to be as lucrative as it might seem. F. (FOR FERGUS) REID BUCKLEY, 40, the youngest son, is the family's novelist, as it was always predictable he would be. Reid is the one who has the distinction of hav ing been labeled the family in tellectual by his father. “He reads nothing but good litera ture,” Buckley Sr. wrote in the occasional family newspaper, Grelmschatka (a contraction of “Great Elm” and the name of the family estate in South Carolina, Kamschatka), when Reid was 23. “There are few young men of his age that have as extensive a vocabu lary. He was at one stage in his youth so given to quota tions that the rest of the chil dren dared not mention at the table any play by Shakespeare, or the poetry of Keats or Shelley or Milton without Reid standing up and deliver ing himself of quotations... that sometimes occupied most of the mealtime.” Reid, whose resemblance to Bill is uncanny both in looks and in those unmistakable mannerisms — the origin of which no one in the family knows and which none of the other Buckley children picked up — was, says his mother, “practically ordered to write by his English professor at Yale.” His first published novel, “Eye of the Hurricane,” which sold 12,000 copies after it came out in 1967, runs to nearly 600 pages—about one third its pre‐editing length. The book is, says the cover slash, “about faith and hate, love and betrayal, men and the sea.” Actually, says Reid, “it's about the corruption in my wife's family.” For the past 12 years, Reid has lived in Spain, where his wife, Betsy, a tall, smash ing‐looking brunette from an old, old Long Island family, is the Madrid correspondent for Harper's Bazaar. To keep some cash corning in, Reid writes movie scripts (“I'm doing one now about the Ken nedys, but I cribbed a lot from my own experience”), and makes a couple of lecture tours around the United States each year. Meanwhile, he is finishing another of his epic books, this one to be called “Servants and Their Masters.” Whose side is he on in the book? “Sneakily, I'm on the servants’ side,” he says, smil ing, eyebrows arched. “It's about the total irrelevance of Spanish society. I'm going to have to leave Spain the mo ment it's published.” At first meeting, Reid ap pears to be the family apos tate. He admits to some of the same suspicions of the mili tary‐industrial complex that the New Left has, approves enthusiastically of the SALT talks, likes to wear colorful, flamenco ‐like costumes and has a wife into the fashion scene and two teen‐age sons with shoulder‐length hair. But, no, it is only more Buckley flamboyance. The truth is, he still stands whenever his mother enters the room, will spend hours defending Amer ica's part in the war against Communism in Vietnam and is probably the most funda mentalist Catholic in the fami ly—except, that is, for Brent Bozell and his wife, Patricia Buckley. BRENT is a hot‐tempered redhead who met Pat through his undergraduate friendship with Bill at Yale. A convert to Catholicism, Bozell took the teachings so literally he was once described by a friend as being just to the right of Ethelred the Unready (but much brighter). The weekend of prep school graduations this June, when many of the Buck leys had assembled at Great Elm in between trips to the commencements for six grand children, Bozell was home in Washington, D. C., leading a vociferous protest demonstra tion against a hospital clinic, to I demand a‐moratorium on abortions. “Where's Brent?” someone asked Saturday after noon. “Oh, he's probably ar rested by now,” someone else replied, thinking it was a joke. Sure enough, page one of the Sunday Washington Post showed a photo of Bo zell, handcuffed and chanting “Viva Cristo Rey” (“I didn't know what it was,” a police man said; “but it didn't sound good”) , as the cops hauled him off. As the leader of a group of 70 cross‐carrying protest ers, Bozell was charged with assaulting an officer, unlaw ful entry and destruction of property. Though neither Brent nor Bill bad‐mouths the other, re lations between them are said to be no better than proper. The reason is that Brent edits a magazine called Tri umph, which has had its ideo logical hassles with National Review. He considers Bill too liberal or, worse yet, irrele vant, for dealing in politi cal prescriptions when only a spiritual rebirth can save the West. “Brent gets annoyed with Bill,” says a family mem ber, “for acknowledging that the City of Man also exists,” and that it must be coped with even, say, to the extent of allowing the U.S. Govern ment to distribute birth‐con trol information to foreign governments which request it. Patricia Buckley Bozell, a pretty redhead, is Brent's managing editor on Triumph, just as her sister Priscilla, gray‐haired but also pretty, is Bill's managing editor on Na tional Review. Priscilla, 48, who never married, is the most easygoing of the Buck leys, the cheeriest of a cheery bunch. The career woman of the Buckley daughters, she worked for United Press In ternational for several years in New York and Paris before returning to the family cause shortly after the National Re view began in 1956. “And, boy, did they need me,” she says with the normal Buckley modesty. “They had all these professors and not enough journalists.” On weekends, Priscilla hustles off to Sharon to play golf and to master her latest hobby, painting, at which she shows considerable talent. The other four Buckley daughters married young and set about raising large fami lies. In 1964, Maureen, then 38 and the mother Of five children, died of an aneurysm and two years later, Aloise, then 47 and the mother of 10 children, died of similar causes. Aloise, by all accounts, was the wittiest of all the family, as well as being per haps the most talented writer. A book of her stories and ar ticles, “Will Mrs. Major Go to Hell?,” published last year, is a genuinely funny collection of some first‐class American humor, dealing mainly with the delights of motherhood and of being a Buckley. The family's deepest fear in pre National‐Review days, she confided gleefully in one arti cle, “was that Gerald L. K. Smith was the only other conservative in America.” The divorces of both the other daughters have caused the whole family consider able anguish. Jane, 46, and Carol, 31, the youngest child; are both attractive and lively women who reacted in A. FAMILY friend says the Buckleys’ conservatism is based not on economics, but on religion and tradition. Mrs. Buckley Sr. proves the point, for her profound Catholicism is almost matched by her love of the gentle South as she knows it. The difference be tween the Yankees and the Southerners, she explains in great high spirits, is demon strated by what happened when the family returned from Europe to the United States in 1933 after four years abroad. “In Sharon, our neighbors walked by me on the street and said, ‘Good morning,” she says with a laugh, “just as though we'd never been gone.” To this day she seems surprised that such a thing could happen. “In Camden [where she still spends her winters] our neigh bors came by, sent flowers, invited us over and welcomed us home.” Aloofness is some thing she would never have tolerated in her children. It helps explain why guests of the Buckleys, sometimes ex pecting snobbishness or worse, tend to come away mumbling dazedly about Southern hospitality. Buckley Sr.'s business re quired him to have a home The family's conservatism has its roots in the South near New York City, but his real love was Kamschatka, the 18‐acre estate in Camden he bought in 1939. Kamschatka was perfect for Buckley, a placid, permanent place in his beloved South, and the fam ily's political outlook no doubt has some roots there. Even now, the general feeling in Camden, years after F.D.R., is that the liberals are still up there in Washington trying to run off with the country. MRS. BUCKLEY is a rac onteur—a word she uses as one of her higher compliments for others. She loves to tell stories and has even been known to tell jokes about the Pope, though only with em barrassment and only when the punch‐line is, well, irre sistible. (She tells one about the Pope's visit to the New York World's Fair, in which two Italian waiters who serve him are wondering what the Pontiff will leave them as a tip. Mrs. Buckley explains what each gets with hand ges tures: the first receives half the sign of a cross and the second the other half.) She speaks affectionately of Rose Kennedy, whom she knows only slightly, but she enjoys telling the story about the time she and Rose ended up at the same retreat: Mrs. Buckley was just mad as heck because Rose got the only private bathroom; however, the Buckley children add that their mother was a personal friend of the head monk and so got invited to have cock tails with him each afternoon, while. Rose did not—clearly a standoff, if not a victory. Reminiscing about her fam ily, Mrs. Buckley explains her view of how the children came to be what they are: “Will had a great sense of humor. He had to, because of our ups and downs financially. We were broke, you know, a few times. He was impossible to quarrel with, not moody or temperamental. He was the family center, so vital, so vi brant. Will never acknowl edged defeat and Bill doesn't either, you know. We were ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

lways happy and the family always had fun together and did things together. At meals we discussed public affairs a lot. But we didn't have indoc trination sessions in politics. He wanted the children to be individuals. And I don't ever remember Will once urging the children to get rich.” Where did social standing come in her husband's priori ties? “You know,” she says, and pauses for a moment, “I don't think social standing ever occurred to Will. He em phasized education, intellect, morality and faith. He taught the children to be loyal to their country, their church and their family. That's the way they are.” Three years ago, when Harper's Bazaar featured Rose Kennedy and Aloise Buckley as America's foremost matri archs, the caption beneath Rose Kennedy's portrait read: “My greatest accomplishment has been bringing up our children... to make full use of their talents and re sources for a notable purpose: benefiting the community, not themselves.” Beneath Aloise Buckley's portrait, the cap tion read: “My great accom plishment is not having one single child who his been a failure (disappointment).” By that, she meant the Buck ley children had kept the faith. S firm conservatives, the Buckleys draw a good deal of criticism for refusing to ac cept the changes of the times. (Priscilla even enjoys a little parody by keep ing in her office a clock on which the hands run back wards.) The changes are corn ing naturally to the grand children, however. With the enthusiastic approval of their parents, several of them have worked in the do‐good proj ects so often associated with the public zeal of liberals. Jane's teen‐age daughter, Tally, and Bill's 17‐year‐old son, Christopher, who shows no signs of following his father onto the polemical battlefield, are both work ing with underprivileged children this summer. Some of the boys are wearing long, long hair, know more about rock music than about the liturgy and, in some cases, stand firmly against the war in Vietnam. “You have a whole climate savagely against our sort of family closeness,” says Reid, explain ing the paths the grandchil dren are on. “It is against our kind of rebellion, against the faith. This is a pagan society and it's bound to affect the grandchildren. Some will be come apostates,” he says. And, he adds, wistfully," “No experience can ever be ex actly repeated.”""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Women's Liberation Gets Into the Long Island Swim,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/10/archives/womens-liberation-gets-into-the-long-island-swim.html,"EAST HAMPTON, L. I., Aug. 9—Everything at the women's liberation party had gone pretty much according to plan. Then Representative Patsy Mink, Democrat of Hawaii, disappeared when she was supposed to speak, and a woman shed her blue jeans and dived into the swimming pool. After that, things were never quite the same. The cocktail reception was a Women's Strike for Equal ity benefit. It was held yes terday in the sculpture‐filled gardens around Mr. and Mrs. Robert Scull's starkly rectan gular summer compound. By 6:30 P.M. perhaps 100 gaily clad guests had arrived. “All I see are the com mitted, their husbands and the press,” Mrs. Betty Fried an, author of “The Feminine Mystique,” said as she sur veyed the crowd. “I hope at least some of them are pay ing guests.” One Husband a Winner Mrs. Friedan, founder of the National Organization of Women, was co‐hostess along with Mrs. Wyatt Cooper (Gloria Vanderbilt), Mrs. Rich ard S. Coulson (Edith De Rham), Mrs. Scull and the writer Gloria Steinem. Mrs. Cooper failed to show, re portedly at the insistence of her husband. “We had flak from some of the husbands,” Mrs. Friedan said. “One man tore, up his wife's invitation. I must say Bob Scull's been very nice.” Aside from a man she described as “our missing mathematician—he looks like Hemingway or Poseidon,” Mrs. Friedan was accompa nied by nine guests from her summer house—a group she persists in calling “my com mune.” She is serious about such issues as abortion on de mand, child care centers and equal pay for women. Yet it was her attire, a long red baby dress with teeny white polka dots, puffed sleeves and deep, deep decolletage, that caused the comment. “You've liberated your dress,” said Mrs. Coulson, author of “How Could She Do That,” a crime book. “You are really liberated.” Mrs. Coulson, like some of the other “sisters” sipping drinks and eating little sand wiches there on the lawn, was fashionably liberated, too. She wore a flesh‐colored body stocking, a long white see‐through caftan and no bra. “I chucked bras six months ago,” she explained. Real Heroine From Capital By this time, Mrs. Mink, whom Mrs. Friedan enthu siastically called “a real heroine of the movement,” had arrived. The diminutive heroine won that accolade by taking on no less a per sonage than Dr. Edgar F. Berman, former Vice Presi dent Hubert H. Humphrey's physician and a member of the Democratic Committee on National Priorities. Dr. Berman had insisted that such factors as the men strual cycle and menopause (or what he called “the rag ing hormonal imbalance”) make women emotionally unfit for top executive jobs. Mrs. Mink, backed by scores of practicing physicians and psychiatrists, said he didn't seem to know what he was talking about. The fight was on. The upshot was Dr. Ber man's resignation from the committee and between 500 and 600 “overwhelmingly” supportive feminist letters on Mrs. Mink's desk. Yet Mrs. Mink, flown up from Washington especially for the party, denied she was a women's liberationist. “I don't like to fit myself into any particular stereo type,” she said. For Individual Crusades Mrs. Mink also opposed bra‐burning as a way of call ing attention to women's rights (“I don't see that any thing can be accomplished by that”), wasn't sure why guests considered Aug. 26 such an important date (NOW and other women's lib groups expect to spend the day— the 50th anniversary of wo men's suffrage — in nation wide demonstrations in sup port of their cause), and said that although there was dis crimination against women, each woman must work to eliminate it in her own way. “Just because I'm interested in women doesn't mean I'm for women's liberation,” she said as her little daughter, Wendy, looked on nonplussed. “I support all groups when what they do coincides with what I believe in.” When Mrs. Mink appeared on the lawn with Mrs. Scull, both women were besieged with guests who wanted to meet Mrs. Mink and congrat ulate her. At the edges of the crowd, other partygoers were getting a little restless. “I paid $25 for liberation and $25 to see the Sculls’ house,” said Dr. Robert Gould, a psychiatrist, “and the house is locked up.” “This is my first feminist party,” said Mrs. Lilian Rixey, a grandmotherly Bridgehamp ton summer resident in a white pants suit. “I'm waiting for something to happen.” Tammy Grimes on Scene Tammy Grimes arrived while Mrs. Rixey was talk ing. The actress, who guessed she was liberated, (“You're freer in the theater. There isn't as much discrimination against an actress”), was braless. But she wore a voluminous green caftan shirtwaist dress, so virtually nobody noticed. At about the same time, Mrs. Timothy Cooney (Joan Ganz), was admitting that it had been her husband who in terested her in the cause. “He's the feminist in the family,” said Mrs. Cooney, the president of the Chil dren's Television Theater, which produces “Sesame Street.” “I was the Uncle Tom. I'm late in the movement. I see it differently now. This strike zeroes in on good issues. It's important and serious ,.. If I'd been an ugly woman with brains I wonder how far I'd have gotten?” At this point, Mrs. Friedan went to the microphone be side the Sculls’ swimming pool and called the party to order. She thanked the Sculls for the use of their yard and said it was “time to finish the unfinished revolution of American women.” Housework Must Go “They must be liberated from menial housework,” she cried, hitching up her plunging décolletage. “In the churches, we must get them out of giving church suppers and to preaching the ser mons. In politics, they shouldn't be looking up zip codes but be the powers. No more of this obscenity of one woman in the Senate. “Nor the obscenity of women in industry,” she said. “Their average wage is little more than half what men get. They are the last hired and the first fired. We've got to break this up.” Mrs. Friedan went on this way for perhaps 10 minutes, noting that “it's fine to be a mommy, but you have to be a person first,” demanding “herstory not just history,” calling for participating in the Aug. 26 strike, and ex plaining that the party was “a great event—a political event and not just a fashion able event to get women into the paper.” Sociologist Sees Gains William J. Goode, profes sor of sociology at Columbia University and president of the American Sociological Association, was next. He talked about what could be the new spread of power. “Men won't be quite the center of attention they were in the past,” he said. “It might be a great gain for men if women had power and weren't so full of rage.” His remarks, delivered in a blue velvet suit with a multi‐striped shirt, were greeted with male and female “bravos.” Then it was Mrs. Mink's turn. Mrs. Friedan introduced her, the crowd applauded and she failed to materialize. “She's gone,” somebody shouted. “You're not serious,” said Mrs. Friedan, looking pained. But Mrs. Mink had gone, apparently without a word to either Mrs. Scull or Mrs. Friedan. Miss Steinem was summoned to take her place. She was discussing Dr. Berman's resignation when Jill Johnston, dance writer for The Village Voice, strip ped to her denim shirt and black panties, and dived into the pool. “It's hot,” Miss Johnston said as she surfaced and re moved her shirt. “You're proving nothing,” cried a voice in the crowd. Miss Johnston, who was braless, went right on swim ming. “It's really nice,” she said, reaching the deep end. “I didn't even pay $25.” Enemy Within Surfaces Mrs. Friedan muttered something about “One of the biggest enemies of this move ment...” The rest was drowned out by the crowd. Miss Steinem tried to speak, too, but without success. “It's a great pool,” Miss Johnston yelled as she reached for a plastic surf board, rolled over on her back and floated for a few seconds. “We are going to be a big political issue,” Mrs. Friedan shrieked into the micro phone. “And now some of us will sing for you.” The sounds of “Liberation Now” came over the loud speaker amid shouts of “Right on!” Mis Johnston, who'd finished four laps, climbed out of the pool, ac cepted a towel Mr. Scull held for her and tripped off into a zinnia bed. Everybody was talking all at once. “I always say if you have a pool, you have a pool,” Mrs. Scull said. shaking her head.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HEALTH LIMITS RACE BY ABORTION BACKER,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/11/archives/health-limits-race-by-abortion-backer.html,"AUBURN, N. Y., Aug. 10 (UPI)—Assemblyman George M. Michaels, Democrat of Auburn, announced today that he was still a candidate for re‐election but that because of ill health he would not campaign ac tively. Mr. Michaels said that his action—dictated by his doctors —was being taken so as not to “mislead” his supporters. He said he would run on his 10‐year record in the Legislature, including his vote on abortion reform, which insured passage of one of the nation's most liberal abortion laws earlier this year. Assemblyman Michaels was seriously injured in a highway accident early in the summer. He left his hospital bed in a wheelchair to vote in the June 23 primary. After his abortion vote, his hometown Cayuga County Dem ocrats endorsed John Rossi of Auburn for his seat.

Touchy Question of Overpopulation,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/12/archives/touchy-question-of-overpopulation-parleys-skirt-issue-of-what.html,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 11 — The latest dance has emerged not from rock‐oriented youth but from their elders: It is the walking‐on‐eggs toe dance around that touchy question that some have dubbed the “population bomb.” Interesting demonstrations of it have developed this week in both the report of the President's Council on En vironmental Qual ity and the Third International Con gress of Food Science and Technology here. The “bomb” concept is simply the belief (that steps must be taken to curb mankind's unbridled pro liferation before there are just more bodies than the earth— only 8,000 miles in diameter— can accommodate. News Analysis The commonplace statistic is that at the present rate of population increase, the earth's population will double in about 30 years, from the present 3.5 billion to 7 billion. This, however, understates the problem. Most people can imagine a world with twice as many people. More staggering is a slight further projection. Seven billion people in the year 2000, some demographers say, would mean 15 billion by 2025, and by 2050, 30 billion. That would mean, less than a century hence, in the life time of some people now living, a world with nearly 10 bodies for every one there is now— a virtually inconceivable situa. tion: But concerted national and, international efforts to reduce) population growth is an agen dum that most people have been reluctant to face because it is such a thorny matter. There are only two avenues. One is persuasion of people to limit family size voluntarily, by contraception, sterilization or abortion. The other is com pulsory, through such means as large‐scale injection of at least temporary infertility drugs into food or water. Some demographers see the voluntary route as adequate. They point out that in less than a century, various circum stances have caused the aver age family size in this country to drop from six children to around three. Problem in India On the other hand, India, with one of the severest popu lation problems, has had an in tensive national birth control campaign under way for more than a decade, and it has been like trying to sweep back the ocean. Some demographers contend that the voluntary approach is futile, because conscientious couples will comply while irre sponsible ones will not and the world will end up peopled by irresponsibles. These contentious factors were close to the surface when one of the United States’ lead ing agricultural scientists ad dressed the international food conference. Dr. George W. Irving Jr., head of the Department of Agriculture's Research Divi sion, said in effect that it was conceivable that the under nourished one‐half of the world could be lifted from the brink of famine, but only with “limits on the size of population.” Simultaneously, the Council on Environmental Quality, in its first annual report, had to deal with the question as per haps the most fundamental of the environmental problems. Its treatment had to he gin gerly and tactful, because the report was essentially a memo randum to the President. And Mr. Nixon was on record—in his July 18, 1969, population message to Congress—as rec ognizing the global urgency of population restraints, with this proviso: “In no circumstances will the activities associated with our pursuit of this goal be al lowed to infringe upon the re ligious convictions or personal wishes and freedom of any in dividual, nor will they be al lowed to impair the absolute right of all individuals to have such matters of conscience re spected by public authorities.” Some observers saw this po sition as being, in long‐range global terms, self‐negating or meaningless. The environmental council dealt with the matter by saying delicately, on page 14 of its report: “Assuming a fixed or nearly fixed resource base, con tinued population growth em bodies profound implications for the United States and the world.” Then, 215 pages later, under “Needed—Comprehensive Poli cies,” came the snapper: “En vironmental quality is difficult to achieve if population growth continues.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Letters to the Editor of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/13/archives/letters-to-the-editor-of-the-times.html,"Draft Directive To the Editor: The Supreme Court decision has now made the conscien tious objection deferment avail able to those who sincerely ob ject to war on grounds other than traditional religious be liefs. Our American tradition of separation of church and state makes this decision a long overdue rectification of a pre viously intolerable situation. It is unfortunate that the National Director of Selective Service, Curtis Tarr, has seen fit to issue a local board direc tive (107) that threatens to open new avenues of inequity in a conscription system al ready overburdened with in equities. One new element in C. O. procedure now makes it virtu ally impossible for a local board to reach a reasonable decision on a C. O. application. Another part of the directive is clearly, discriminatory against those who have not had access to higher education. The local board must now decide for it self whether an applicant is “sincere” in his objection to war. Guidelines for such a de cision are not provided, and in deed could never be provided. An applicant for C. O. status must show that his own con science has been informed by “rigorous training, contempla tion, study, or other activity, comparable in vigor and dedi cation to the processes by which traditional religious con victions are formulated...”, presumably a condition which can be reasonably met by those trained in philosophy or theo logical ethics. Since applicants for C. O. status will, from now on, tend to be boys who have just gradu ated from high school,. such con ditions are obviously unreason able. We can only hope that the directives which are not only vague but also clearly discrim inatory will be fought in the courts. SHELDON R. ISENBERG Princeton, N. J., July 23, 1970 Democrats’ Inflation To the Editor: Record standards of living mean little if they are accom panied by record inflation. Wil liam V. Shannon forgets this in praising the inflation‐ridden Johnson Administration. [Edi torial page column July 27.] President Nixon has cut de fense spending. He is working successfully to control the in flation of the preceding Demo cratic Administration. However, a Democratic Congress must co operate; so far it has not. Democratic Congressmen seem to be wearing the same blinders as does Mr. Shannon. Like him they protest defense spending (at its lowest percent age levels in twenty years) as inflationary, yet they pass such clearly inflationary bills as the Hill‐Burton bill. CLAIRE OWENS Washington, July 30, 1970 Captive Nations To the Editor: Your Aug. 3 editorial entitled “Finland Revives the Court” was noted with interest. Cer tainly no one will argue against the premise that use of the In ternational Court of Justice should be encouraged. However, the subject of your editorial highlights a rather un fortunate trend in current inter national affairs, i.e., the tend ency to judge an international act not by its essential nature but rather by the identity of the actor. The continued presence of South Africa in Namibia (South‐West Africa) may pre sent a problem, but quite a few similar questions remain unre solved, as, for instance, the con tinued presence of the Soviet Union in Estonia. Interesting in this connection is the posture of Finland. While no fault can surely be found with its Namibian initiative per se, it is regrettable that Finland has never felt motivated to make a similar move on behalf of Estonia. This neighboring country, cul turally and linguistically related to Finland, was a member of the League of Nations, has much closer ties to Finland than Namibia, and suffers the contin ued presence of an alien author ity. Although it might be claimed that Finland has a high er obligation toward its neigh bor for this reason than it has to an embryonic entity such as Namibia, whatever obligation exists must be of equal weight, since the principle of self‐de termination for all peoples is a cornerstone of Unitedt Nations philosophy. It would thus be an inconsistency for the interna tional community to ignore claims for self‐determination put forth on behalf of nations such as Estonia, while at the same time proclaiming the ab solute moral imperative of self determination for territories whose cultural and historic identity are often not too well developed. Of course the reasons why Finland prefers to espouse the cause of Namibia rather than that of Estonia are not hard to discern. However, the forcible occupation of Estonia and the other two Baltic republics and the deprivation of the right of self‐determination for these peo ples represent a continuing sore in the international body poli tic. The fact that this situation is totally ignored is at least equally as “damaging to the interests of the United Nations system as a whole and to the structure of international law” as is the decline of the Inter national Court. ENNO W. ERCKLENTZ Jr. New York, Aug. 4, 1970 Second Line on Ballot To the Editor: The efforts by Richard Ot tinger and James Buckley to create fictitious “independent” parties to give themselves a sec ond line on the ballot are the latest attempts to implement a political strategy that has be come traditional. In recent elections virtually every candidate has sought “equal time” on the ballot by means of a second line. In 1969, the ballot became so cluttered that Mayor Lindsay's support ers went to court and had two legitimate minor parties, the Socialist Workers party and the Socialist Labor party, thrown off the ballot to make room for an “Independent Party” whose sole function was to give the Mayor a second line, and which ceased to exist the day after the election. The usual justification for a second line is the opportunity given the voter to support a candidate whose party affilia tion displeases him. This con tradicts the currently, fashion able theory that today's sophisticated electorate is ‐in dined to vote for the man. rather than the party. Perhaps, to assure an unclutz tered ballot, all candidates should abide by a new maxim: “One man, one line.” JULIAN A. STEIN Queens Village, N. Y July 31, 1970 To Control Pollutants, To the Editor: Your dramatic pictures of air polluted Sydney and Tokyo (July 29) make it crystal clear that population density of a country is not correlative to the pollution of its cities, since in the case of Sydney, Australia. has the lowest density of all continents of the world. Curtailment of population through extensive antipeople measures is not the solution Despite Japan's radical and eft fective promotion of abortion— fetal deaths from abortion ex ceed live births—Tokyo remains the most polluted of all cities internationally. The answer clearly is the di rect control of pollutants at in dustrial and automotive sources. Those who bracket people with pesticides and air pollutants and confuse population control with pollutant control sidetrack us from the real solutions.

"Finding Identity, Black Nuns Put Soul Into Religious Life",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/15/archives/finding-identity-black-nuns-put-soul-into-religious-life-black-nuns.html,"SOUTH BEND, Ind., Aug. 13—Sister Juanita Shealey, dressed in a long brown and yellow dashiki, took a sip of wine from a silver chalice, then passed the chalice to the nun standing directly behind her. As she turned and walked past the line of sisters—many with Afro haircuts—bongos, congos and guitars softly beat out the gospel hymn “Go Down, Moses.” Sister Juanita, a parochial elementary school principal from Cleveland, is one of the country's estimated 900 black Roman Catholic nuns. She is also part of a growing move ment in their ranks to inject Soul into the modern religious life. This week, 160 sisters, along with a number of black priests and seminarians, gath ered on the campus of the University of Notre Dame to discuss the “celibate black commitment” and celebrate their blackness. Members Are Angry Frustrated by ideals devel oped in white European’ set tings, they are rethinking everything from their dress to their vows in the light of their growing black identity. Angered at what they re gard as the “irrelevance” of the Catholic Church to black Americans, they are seeking new ways to dedicate their lives not only to God but also to black liberation. “We can no longer say that black religious don't know what's happening,” said Sis ter Marcellina Brook, one of the speakers. “Many black re ligious are what's happening.” The meeting is the third annual conference of the Na tional Black Sisters’ Con ference. The organization, which lists 300 members, was founded by Sister Martin de Porres Grey, a 27‐year‐old member of the Pittsburgh Sis ters of Mercy. The sisters represent only a fraction of a per cent of the 160,000 nuns in the country. The first black order, the Oblate Sisters of Providence, was founded in Baltimore in 1828 to serve black refugees from Santo Domingo, and in its early years faced wide spread hostility from white Catholics, including threats of lynching. Blacks have been welcom ed in most white orders only since World War II, and even congregations dedicated to working among Negroes have been reluctant to accept them into membership. In addition, when blacks did become nuns they found that many of the ideals of re ligious life—constant control of emotion, rigid schedules, denigration of the physical—contradicted some of the highest values of black cul ture. “Entering an order meant ceasing to be black and look ing on what you grew up with as uncouth, said Sister Christine Nesmith, a 22‐year‐old member of the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament. “You could do the Irish jig, but anything African was taboo.” As in black society gener ally, a change of attitude among black nuns began to occur with the civil rights and black power “movements of the nineteean‐sixties. It coin cided with a general mood of reform among white nuns as well. For some, a discovery of new black identity led to job changes. Sister Joyce Wil liams, a 46‐year‐old member of the Order of St. Benedict, for instance; moved from a teaching job in Minnesota of social action work in the black community of Cleve land. “After the assassination of Martin Luther King, I told my superiors that I could no longer work in a white school,” she said. Sister Sylvia Thibodeux, a teacher in the Roxbury sec tion of Boston, for instance, said that she now taught sub jects such as consumer af fairs to sbe more relevant to, needs eeds. “Every kid com ing out of a black school ought to know how to or ganize a rent strike by the eighth grade,” she said. Black awareness caused other nuns to begin re‐exam ining Christian theology in light of black experience. Sis ter Theresa Perry, a 25‐year‐old doctoral student in theol ogy at Yale University, for instance, told her fellow sis ters this week that Christian theology must deal with themes such as the coloniza tion of whole peoples. “We cannot afford to see theology as simply an Intel lectual exercise,” she said. One effect of this has been a rethinking of the vow of celibacy as it affects black sisters. The Turning Point Sister Theresa, for instance, links celibacy to black libera tion and argued that it makes a sister more “available” to serve her people. “To be celi bate means to dedicate our selves totally and completely to building the new,” she said. “It frees us to help free a people.” For many black nuns—es pecially those in white or ders—the turning point has been the meeting of the Black Sisters’ Conference. “I'd never seen black nuns before—all together and just talking about black people,” said Yvonne TuCker, a 27‐year‐old sister from Chicago. “It was very emotional, and it made me rethink a lot of my values and be more hon est about my blackness.” She said that one concrete result was a decision to switch to another order that would allow her more free dom to work among blacks. Numerous sisters said frankly that their new black awareness had forced them to ask whether the religious life in the Catholic Church was compatible with involve ment with their people. ‘A Racist Institution’ “The church is a racist in stitution, and no one knows this better than young black Catholics,” said Sister Callis ta Armand of the Sisters of the Holy Family in New Or leans. Many have obviously de cided that the two are in compatible. “About 50 mern berg of the conference have left in the last year,” said Sis ter Martin, who is the only black in her order. Others, however, report that their commitment to the religious life has been strengthened. Sister Madeline Wicks, a 32‐year‐old teacher in New Orleans who switched to an Afro haircut last spring, said that she had become more devoted to her work. “I know now that at least one group of black children is be ing pushed to accept them selves with dignity,” she said. Sister Theresa spoke in theological terms. “Christian ity has been the arm of op pression since early times, and that is the way blacks have experienced it,” she said: “But the Word of God can also be used as a force. for liberation.” Different Priorities Such ideas necessarily lead to an ambiguous relationship with white church leaders. On the one hand, black nuns rec ognize that they are but a tiny minority in the church and need not only the finan cial support of whites but also their assistance in staffing:; black parishes. On the other hand, they are aware that their priovi ties are different even from those of white liberals seek ing to reform the church and the religious life. Blacks, for instance, have not shown great interest in ecology or the war or in issues such as abortion and birth control, which do not become critical for them because of the ex tended family structures that operate in black society. One problem facing the new breed of black nuns is the conservatism of the coun try's three all‐black orders, which together comprise two thirds of all black nuns. Like black Protestant denomina tions, they have tended to be cautious in asserting the new black awareness, and young sisters who put on dashikis report that they are some times accused of flirting with Communism and the devil. “We tend to have a don't rock‐the‐boat attitude,” said Sister Alice Chineworth, a 53‐year‐old member of the Ob late Sisters of Mary. “Many sisters of my generation say that we already know we're black. But that's not the kind of black we need.” Nevertheless, the new style of black religious life seems to be growing. It combines the radical respect for in dividual conscience prized by reformist‐minded white nuns with distinctly black respect for emotion and spontaneity. One mark of black sisters is the irrelatively casual ac ceptance of close relation ships with black priests and brothers. One important result of this has been that black nuns— together with black priests and seminarians—have devel oped a sense of “community” that in many ways consti tutes the ideal sought but rarely achieved by religious orders. This was evident last night when Sister Peter Douglas, a member of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Cluny, chose to re new her vows at a soul mass here rather than in the midst of her own order. Others have added a commitment to the black people to their ini tial vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. To some, this sense of com munity is significant not only to blacks but also to the church as a whole. “Community is the spring board of our freedom, said. Sister Martin. “Our work flows out of prayer. A lot of white congregations today have lost this sense of love and trust. Maybe we can show them that it's still possible.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bailey Sees Senatorial Primary in Connecticut on Wednesday as a Close Contest,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/16/archives/bailey-sees-senatorial-primary-in-connecticut-on-wednesday-as-a.html,"HARTFORD, Aug. 15—John Bailey, the chairman of the Democratic party in Connecti cut, considered the primary election in his party next Wednesday to select a candi date for the United States Sen ate and said: “It's a horse race, ne saiu, flipping an imaginary coin yes terday to heighten his allusion to an unpredictable gamble. Most politicians in Connecti cut see the primary as a close contest between Alphonsus J. Donahue, a Stamford business man who was endorsed by a slim margin at the Democratic state convention, and the Rev. Joseph Duffey, a Congrega tional minister and the national chairman of the Americans for Democratic Action. Convention Forced Vote A third candidate, Edward Marcus, a 43‐year‐old lawyer who has served 12 years in the State Senate, is regarded as a long‐shot possibility. Like the Republicans this week, the Democrats will be having their first primary for a statewide office. The primary was forced when Mr. Duffey and Mr. Marcus each got more than 20 per cent of the votes cast at the party's state conven tion. “We obviously started as an enormous underdog, 20 yards behind the goal line,” Mr. Mar cus said last night. “But think we're moving up rapidly.” The majority of political lead ers give Mr. Donahue, who is 53, a slight edge over the 38‐year‐old Mr. Duffey. But they are agreed that Mr. Donahue's advantage could dissolve if there is a low turnout from the 475,000 registered Democrats and the ambitious band of sup porters that Mr. Duffey has or ganized since 1968 is thus able to dominate the ballot boxes, ‘Good Constituency’ Anne Wexler, who was co chairman with Mr. Duffey of Eugene J. McCarthy's Presiden tial campaign in Connecticut, estimated that more than 70,000 people were committed to vot ing for Mr. Duffey. “The people who support Joe Duffey are almost fanatically behind him,” said one of Mr. Donahue's aides. “There's no question about his organiza tion's ability to get out the vote. It's a hard, good consti tuency. If there's a low turnout, we're definitely in trouble.” The aide did some fast arith metic on the back of an enve lope and predicted that with 35 per cent of the Democrats cast ing ballots, Mr. Donahue would win by 7,000 to 8,000 votes. That Mr. Donahue, the party endorsed candidate and the 65‐year‐old Mr. Bailey's personal choice, is only a slight favorite is considered by many to be evidence of a decline in influ ence of the man who has led the Democratic organization in Connecticut for the last 24 years. He also served as na tional chairman of the party from 1961 to 1968. Dodd Lacked Backing At some point before the state convention in June, Mr. Bailey quietly selected Mr. Donahue to replace Senator Thomas J.Dodd, who had been censured by his colleagues in 1967 for diverting campaign funds to personal use and there after was considered as a liabil ity to the party. Mr. Dodd dropped out of the Democratic contest after it be came clear that he could not win party endorsement and after he suffered a mild heart attack. He is now seeking re election as an independent. The first clear sign that Mr. Bailey was losing control of the party came at the convention when Mr. Donahue succeeded in achieving a majority by only eight votes and two insurgents managed to force the first, statewide primary in the his tory of the party by getting at least 20 per cent of the dele gate vote each. Shortly afterward, largely be cause of efforts of the insur gents, the state central com mittee voted to remain neutral in the primary instead of wholeheartedly backing Mr. Donahue. In addition, a United States Representative, Emilio Q. (Mim) Daddario, the Democratic nom inee for Governor, made it clear that he would not cam paign for Mr. Donahue, pre sumably because he feared alienating the suporters of Mr. Duffey and, to some extent, of Mr. Marcus. Mr. Bailey said yesterday that he had telephoned several party leaders across the state, urging them to try to get out a big vote but not specifically asking them to back Mr. Donahue. “Bailey's one of the smartest guys in the business,” an old political acquaintance said. “He just knows it's no use. He's still got old friendships. But it's a different world today. The Bailey organization is a lot of old men. He's got nothing to deliver. The people have spread nut into the suburbs. The blacks and the Puerto Ricans are in the cities.” In a series of debates, the candidates have agreed on a number of issues. They all favor the 18‐year‐old vote, a speedy withdrawal from Vietnam, mili Itary aid to Israel, abortion re form and improved housing. They oppose expansion of the antiballistic missile system and protest drug abuse. They agree that the economy is in a sad state and on the Penn Central Railroad, but they offer differ ent solutions. Mr. Marcus has criticized his opponents, neither of whom have been elected to public of fice, for their lack of experience, and Mr. Duffey and Mr. Dona hue have challenged each other's qualifications. Mr. Duffey, a liberal who has attempted to broaden his base and has considerable labor sup port, argues that he is the only Democrat who provides a clear choice in a race with Mr. Dodd, a conservative, and United States Representative Lowell p. Weicker, a moderate who won the Republican primary for the United States Senate last week. Mr. Duffey is a member of the policy council of the Democratic National Council and has served as director of the Center for Urban Ethics in Hartford. Mr. Donahue points to his experience as president of a large zipper packaging and dis tributing concern for 21 years and says the Senate needs a good salesman and a man who can handle a budget. He calls the late President Franklin D. Roosevelt's fireside chats “masterpieces of Salesman ship.” Both Mr. Donahue and Mr. Marcus describe themselves as moderates, but Mr. Marcus ap pear to have begun taking more conservative positions lately. Two weeks ago, in a letter to sports clubs, Mr. Marcus declared his opposition to legis lation requiring registration of firearms, especialy on the Fed eral level, and a few days ago he proposed that unauthorized trespass on a college campus be made a felony. Democrats who hope for a heavy vote were encouraged by the Republican primary last week, in which 33 per cent of those eligible went to the polls. Some Democrats, including Mr. Bailey, anticipate a turnout Wednesday as high as 40 per cent, partly because of interest generated by the Republicans and because of primaries on the same day in two Congres sional districts where more than 35 per cent of the state's registered Democrats live. In one of those two, which is made up of 13 communities in the greater Hartford area, State Senator Jay Jackson, the party‐endorsed candidate, is be ing challenged by the State In surance Commissioner, William R. Cotter. In the second district, which contains 64 towns in eastern Connecticut and covers half the land area of the state, State Senator John Pickett, the party endorsed candidate, is opposed by State Senator William Stan ley.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Prague Two Years After; ‘What is the most neutral country in the world?’ ‘Czechoslovakia. She doesn't even intervene in her own internal affairs.’,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/16/archives/prague-two-years-after-what-is-the-most-neutral-country-in-the.html,"PRAGUE. ON Aug. 21, 1968, a young stu dent named Jana returned to Prague from France and was told by a taxi driver, “We are in vaded.” “By whom?” she asked. From the day the Russians occupied Czechoslovakia, the Czechoslovak people have remained subdued and largely uninformed onlookers to devel opments in their country. Two years ago, their leaders told them to remain calm. They have been doing more or less that ever since; they have had little choice. The burning of the Soviet Aeroflot office in Pragup in March, 1969 —seven months after the Soviet tanks arrived—gave the hard‐liners the final excuse they needed to get rid of Alex ander Dubcek as party secretary. More significantly, the episode illustrated the impotence of the Czechoslovak people. For the speculation was that pro‐Soviet provocateurs had incited the attack. on Aeroflot (which grew out of demonstrations against the Russians inspired by the Czecho slovak hockey team's victory over the U.S.S.R.) in order to provide proof of counterrevolutionary activ ity. Thus the function of protest had also been appropriated. Now, protest only benefited the pro‐Soviet ele ments in the power struggle. Heads we win. Tails you lose. “How can you tell which of Presi dent Svoboda's seven telephones the direct line to Moscow?” “It has an earphone, but no mouth piece.” A YEAR ago, on the first anni versary of the invasion, leaflets cir culating in Prague urged people to remain calm. A quiet protest was planned which involved the wearing of black on the 21st, and the boycot ting of shops and public transporta tion. On the afternoon of the 19th, I was stopped on my way to get some shoes repaired by a line of congenial police who were bantering with rush hour shoppers. Suddenly, to every one's great surprise and. amusement, four Czechoslovak Army troop car riers appeared in Wenceslaus Square, and truckloads of slightly bemused, cigarette‐smoking Czechoslovak sol diers lined the streets. I went home to get my camera. When I returned, the air was soaked with tear gas and a little boy was passing out paper napkins for us to dry our eyes on. We darted in and out of the arcades in Wenceslaus, playing hide‐and‐Seek with the water “cannons” the troops had turned against the playful crowd. Even though neither the troops nor the people were in an angry mood, snap shots were taken of the “counter revolutionaries,” to be used as evidence that further “normaliza tion” was necessary. A few weeks later, we lunched at the home of a veteran Czech jour nalist and her family. Changing our outdoor shoes for slippers, as is the custom, we settled down for some chatter over gin‐and‐tonics. Some body brought up politics. “The people have played their part,” said our host. “Now, we're only spectators at a boring theater performance played by third‐rate actors. Nothing they do has anything to do with us anymore.” Not quite. On Oct. 9 they closed the border to the West. A sense of complete isolation fell upon the city. Winter was long and cold and plagued by nightly blackouts and chronic economic shortages. “What animal, native to Czechoslo vakia, is 200‐meters long and eats only potatoes?” Answer: “The meat queue.” AFTER a few months in the United States, I returned to Czechoslovakia this year on a hot spring day. Lenin posters at the border were a new addi tion, but the guards were friendly and, as usual, full of fun. Hitchhikers in bathing suits lined the roads. When I arrived in Brno, the main square was teeming with families pushing baby carriages and eating ice cream. I tried to call a friend in Prague and found that no telephone numbers beginning with eight were working. All was in order. On the train to Prague, I drank cold Plzen beer with some Moravians. They berated the people of Prague (who are Bohemians) for having a coarse, unpleasant character which—they said—appeared to derive mainly from beer drinking. They explained that Moravians were more cultured. They drank wine. One man devoured my copy of Time magazine. When I told him he could keep it, he praised everything Ameri can, from hot dogs to Hemingway. Another man proudly showed me his Apollo 11 button. I promised to send him a postcard from New York. One of the reasons I was returning to Prague at this time was to witness the celebrations in honor of the 100th anniversary of Lenin's birth. Last year, the only likeness of Lenin I had found was in the East German cul tural center. A Czech Communist professor had told me that “unlike the Russians, we admire Lenin as a man, not as a god.” This year, Lenin was reincarnated in Prague. He perched proudly over heaps of salami, chewed his pencil contemplatively amid a display of women's hats; his bald head competed with photos of pretty Czech models in the latest hairstyles. Half the listings in the Czech TV weekly announced pro grams on Lenin. “What significant historical event happened in 1875?” Answer: “Lenin was 5 years old.” Pairs of miniature flags like those children wave at parades fluttered from every window sill and balcony. The Russian red field with the tiny yellow hammer‐and‐sickle in the cor ner stood side by side with the Czechoslovak tricolor—provocative ly, but unmolested. The flags flapped noisily in the wind and threatened to swoop down on the people like so many of Hitchcock's birds. But the strollers in Wenceslaus were enjoy ing the spring weather (come at last!) and didn't seem to notice at all. “You wouldn't believe it now,” said Jana. “But people used to put out flags in this country because they were happy.” THE mayor of a small village is summoned before a Communist party committee to report on his plans for the forthcoming celebration. “What celebration?” asks the mayor. “What celebration! Why, the 100th anniversary of our greatest Socialist hero! You mean you haven't read anything about it in the newspapers? Or heard anything on radio or TV? You mean you don't even know it's Lenin's birthday?” “No,” answers the mayor. As he is dismissed, his interrogator follows him out of the room and asks in a low whisper: “Hey, comrade. Would you mind telling me what village you live in?” It's not necessary to move to a small village to escape Lenin. Most Czechoslovaks have an amazing fa cility for simply ignoring all political matters unless they affect them per sonally. I felt almost cheated by the lack of interest—or even awareness —which my Czech friends demon strated toward the political turmoil in their country. How dare you return to life as normal and deprive me of my drama! You can't weep for a nation which is glued happily to the TV set absorbed for two solid weeks in the world soccer championships. An American friend of mine came to Prague to study the role of the Czechoslovak trade unions in 1968. When my Czech friends learned of her project, they were greatly amused. They poked fun at each other for the rest of the evening, asking in mock seriousness: “Now, what do you think of the role of the Czechoslovak trade unions in 1968?” Giggles. Who cares? Cohen, the protagonist in many Czechoslovak jokes, is asked to un cover an information leak in the party organization. He calls a plenum of the Central Committee and carefully sur veys the audience while the party's most prominent leaders drone on. Suddenly, in the midst of the First Party Secretary's speech, Cohen calls out: “Section 4. Row B. Seat 14.” The man in the seat is arrested and, sure enough, turns out to be the spy the party was seeking. “That's incredible, Cohen!” says the party secretary. “How did you know he was the one?” “I just remembered what Lenin once said,” answers Cohen. “The enemy never sleeps.” COMMUNIST politics bore Czecho slovaks; Western politics just perplex them. They shake their heads, bewil dered, at the American penchant for demonstrating about everything from air pollution to women's liberation. A construction worker in Bratislava questioned me closely about salaries and living conditions in the United States. His apartment was modern and efficient, and he had just acquired a Skoda after five years of saving. His young wife, who was translating for us, hadn't had a new dress in three years in order to save money for a car. He asked his wife to translate a question which struck them both as so funny that she could hardly blurt it out amid the giggles. “Is it really true,” she laughed, “that in America workers drive in cars to demonstrate for higher wages?” The people are surprisingly familiar with life and cus toms in the West. “Snoopy and the Red Baron” is played at intermissions of ice‐hockey matches; Spiro Agnew is al most a household word. Stores advertise pants suits and midiskirts—but that doesn't mean you'll find any inside. Coca‐Cola, still very expensive, is often poured into wine glasses. On the win dow of a passing car, I saw, “Nemam tigra v nadrzi”—“I don't have a tiger in my tank.” But although the trappings of Western life have penetrat ed deeply in Czechoslovakia, its values, philosophies and conflicts have not. Most of the issues which concern West ern countries don't even exist in Czechoslovakia. Women have always been “liberated” in the sense that most doc tors, train porters and tram conductors are women. Free love is, well, free. Abortions are not, but can be obtained by presenting proof to the authorities that one is not financially able to support a child. Pot and poverty are not issues; no one has pot, and everybody has poverty. The Vietnam war, like the invasion of Czechoslovakia, is seen as a logical outcome of what the Czechoslovaks ac cept as the division of the world into two blocs at Yalta. It is a conflict between two superpowers. It has noth ing to do with capitalism or Communism as competing ideologies. From a personal stand point — the significant stand point for Czechoslovaks—Americans are generally well liked. North Vietnamese stu dents in Prague—with their rice parties and other strange ways—are regarded with sus picion. But since the war in Vietnam is obviously engi neered by them—the Ameri can “them” in this case—it has no more real interest for Czechoslovaks than the doings of South American dictators. The young particularly are op posed to the American pres ence in Vietnam because they are opposed to any foreign in tervention in the internal af fairs of another country. “What is the most neutral country in the world?” “Czechoslovakia. She does n't intervene in her own in ternal affairs.” THE conflict between a more adventurous younger generation and an older gen eration which is more securi ty‐oriented exists in Czecho slovakia as elsewhere. How ever, the range of issues and the depth of feeling of the generation gap in the West can occur only in a society in which the experiences of the young contrast significantly with those of their parents. In Czechoslovakia, all genera tions are still more or less in the same boat—economi cally, politically and psycho logically. Almost all the young live with their parents, many with their grandparents as well, and not a few in apartments housing four gen erations. ” ‘It's the worst of times,’ said Zuzana. ‘It's a time for crying, and these people are laugh ing. That's why I love them.’ “ An Establishment does exist in Czechoslovakia, but it is profoundly different from that in the West because nothing and no one is ever really “es tablished.” The lack of private enterprise renders impossible the perpetuation of a class of people holding tremendous amounts of power and money. No one in Czechoslovakia has tremendous amounts of money. The small group of party and government officials who hold the power are sub ject to the same changes of fortune which determine the fate of the people. Below these functionaries, moreover, all people are allowed power in relatively equal proportions. Professionals, workers, stu dents and intelligentsia mingle with a degree of facility un known in the West—all clas sifications become irrelevant. One feels a little bit naked, and it feels good. On a Prague tram recently, startled passengers were greeted in five languages by a congenial conductor who was also an expert in memory tricks. He remembered and announced the proper stop for each passenger. “I'm sorry I don't speak French,” he apolo gized, “but the driver in the tram behind us is a former colleague from Charles Uni versity, and he was a profes sor of French.” It has since been decreed that no former members of the intelligentsia are to be hired by the tram or taxi com panies. BUT if there is a lack of social climbing in Prague, for there is nowhere to climb, there is also an intriguing simplicity of life. The neces sities are provided for and the frills are usually either quite inexpensive or unob tainable. At one of Prague's better restaurants, we ordered mush rooms, the specialty of the house. “Sorry,” said thee waiter. “We haven't had mushrooms in a month.” As we proceeded through the rest of the menu to no avail, the waiter said, “We have no veal, no pork, and no beefsteak.” “Well, what do you have then?” “We have an occupation.” Housing (when you can find it), food (except for meat) , public transportation and entertainment are‐ex tremely cheap. When my Czechoslovak friends learned that I was paying $20 a month for a private room in an apartment, they thought it was outrageous. At the offi cial exchange rate of 16 crowns to the dollar, dinner in the finest restaurant costs no more than $3, a theater ticket $1.50, and movie 50 cents. The airplane fare from Prague to Brno (equivalent to New York‐Washington, D.C.) is about $9. At the black market exchange rate, jou can almost divide these prices by three. I fractured three ribs in a car accident in Prague and was unable to locate the clinic for foreigners. Armed with my “Teach ‐Yourself ‐Czech” book, I stumbled into the lobby of a large hospital and somehow managed to convey what my problem was. With in 45 minutes, I had a com plete series of X‐rays, and was bandaged and presented with a bottle of codeine pills for the pain. While the X‐rays were being developed, the doctor told me about his brother in San Francisco and praised the American astro nauts. “How much do I owe you?” I asked. The doctor and nurses just Smiled and shook their heads, refusing to accept even a token payment. Of course, all health services are free. All education is also free—in a financial sense, anyway. There is no such thing as stu dent power. Students who wish to remain students—and this is not a matter to be taken lightly—simply do not attempt to force changes in admission policies, military training, or the conduct of the nation's foreign affairs. I lived in a student hostel which served as a dormitory for medical students. Four of us slept on cots in a large, bare room. There were no car pets, to ephones, desks, bu reaus. One common bathroom two flights down served 200 students. The girl next to me hr my room was an artist from Slovakia. She was studying medicine and had no inclina tion for it whatsoever. The explanation? Out of 200 stu dents who had qualified to study art, there was room in the university for only 50. There was plenty of room in the medical school. All students were required to pass a six‐week course in the “current‐situation.” The classes covered events of the past two years as interpreted by the new pro‐Soviet leader ship. Recent measures imple mented by the new Education Minister, Jaromir Hrbek, have especially affected students in the humanities and social sciences. Many courses in sociology, philosophy and political science, for example, have been dropped altogether from the university curricu lum. Olga, a serious‐minded stu dent of English literature, found her future completely upset owing to the changes of the last two years. Her hopes to study in London for a year were dashed by the new travel restrictions. Al ternatively, she wanted to teach, but that would mean teaching programs and out looks with which she dis agreed violently. For the time being she was just waiting, hoping that things might change. Her parents were pressuring her to “settle down,” “face reality” and “become a useful member of society.” If Olga were a stu dent in the West, she might “drop out” for a year or so. But in Czechoslovakia there is no dropping out. There is only compromise. In a recent test of Commu nist loyalty, all party members were asked to submit written statements agreeing with the policies of the new leader ship. Hundreds forsook their principles and went along with the regime. Those who stood by their opposition gained nothing, were thrown out of the party and probably lost their jobs. Martyrdom is not practical when you have young children to support. IF Czechoslovakia is not yet “normalized,” it Is certainly neutralized. The adjustment to the new situation has already been made by the majority. Jiri, a second‐year law stu dent, had wanted to attend an American university for a year. When the Russians came, he decided to emigrate per manently. Unfortunately, the border was closed before his scheduled departure. Jiri was so depressed last winter that we couldn't even persuade him to join us for a beer. This spring, he was a new man with a new apartment and a new sports car. Business on the black market had been good. A long‐haired, fashion‐con scious young girl named Zu zana used to complain that Prague restaurants were un sophisticated and that she never had a chance really to dress up and go out on the town. Now, when we stopped for a glass of wine at a local tavern, Zuzana bragged that you couldn't find such a “cozy” atmosphere in New York. “I can go to every res taurant in Prague just like this,” she said, looking down at her red wool bell‐bottoms. “Nobody looks at me.” Zuzana's boy friend drove us to Slapy for a swim in the Vltava River. The grassy banks were littered with beer, chocolate bars, dogs, naked children and a few women in bra and panties in lieu of bi kini. Five or six young people joined us. Three of them spoke English, but I wasn't aware of it until almost time to go home. Last year, passing up a chance to chat with an Ameri can would have been rare in deed. The Czechs are turning inward. A lot of this is forced, and it shows. One very good friend, Vojta, a theater critic, had a great ambition to study in England. Now, he said that he was occupied with “more seri ous. matters” and couldn't af ford to “go traveling all over the world with no purpose, like Americans do.” Vojta and I went to visit a young married couple who were living in a small village about a half hour from Prague. The wooden house was quaint ly decorated with curiosities searched out in attics and junk shops. The husband exchanged musical tapes with recording enthusiasts all over the world, and the sounds of radio Pitts burgh filled the room as we ate chiebicky, open‐faced sandwiches. I mentioned to Vojta that the couple's house seemed an ideal place to raise their new baby, and that they were lucky to have such a home. He burst out laughing. “You think they moved out here because they wanted to? There's no plumb ing and hardly any heat in the winter. They moved here when the baby came because there wasn't any more room in her parents’ apartment, and they couldn't find a place in Prague. You mean you haven't learned yet that there are no idealists in this country?” THERE were idealists in Prague before Aug. 21, 1968. The parents of a friend named Olga, for example, had been dedicated Communists since 1948. Even under the harshest days of Novotny's Stalinist rule, they believed that Com munism promised the bright est future for Czechoslovakia. And although they welcomed reforms, they distrusted Dubcek's abandonment of controls and his permission of unrestrained criticism of the former regime. They had also believed that the Rus sians were their friends. Now all that was changed. Olga's mother was expelled from the Communist party as a “liberal.” Her youngest son emigrated to Austria, and she fears that she may never see him again. Not long ago, I joined the family for a dinner of steak (it was a special occasion) and dumplings. We sipped slivo vitz and Turkish coffee, and listened to some barely audi ble American records from the nineteen‐thirties. Olga's father pulled our some old photo albums from previous vaca tions: Germany, Italy, Cuba. Suddenly the power failed and we lit candles. They say that in Communist China the lights throughout the country must all be turned off when Mao Tse‐tung goes to bed at night, so we joked thut Mao must be retiring early tonight. Olga's father mumbled some thing about “Communists,” and her mother shook her head and gazed sadly at the worn gray carpet. “Well,” I ventured, “you can always hope that things will get better.” “Hope?” said Olga's‐mother. “We've..been hoping for over 20 years.” THE younger generation of, Czechoslovaks, raised exclu sively under Novotny's Stalin ist government, never learned to cherish the ideals of Corn mrmism. For them, liberal Communist Dubcek was only a stepping stone to no Com munists at all. I visited Jan and Slavek, two young lawyers who were working in a bank because they couldn't bring them selves to practice law in a country they consider law‐) less. Slavek joked about the Russian charge that Czecho slovakia in the spring of 1968 was a hotbed of counterrev olutionaries. He told me how someone had facetiously put a sign on the maternity hos pital which read: “Twelve new counterrevolutionaries born today.” “But it was a counterrevo lution,” said Jan. “Six months more of Dubcek and Czecho slovakia would have ‘defected’ to the West. You couldn't really expect the Russians to “The fear is not what it was in the Novotny era... Dur ing two years of un certainty, outspoken protest survived to an incredible extent.” just sit by while a pro‐West ern government was looming up on their very borders.” Slavek asked Jan if he still felt that Czechoslovakia was worth lighting for. Last year, Jan had forfeited a chance to go to Italy because, as he said, he wanted to fight for his country. “Now I have to stay because I want to die here,” Jan laughed. “But seriously, Czechoslovakia still is my country.” “Whose country?” asked Slavek. The people of Czechoslo vakia feel completely alien ated from their Government. Few of last years outspoken liberal guard are noticeably resisting the current turn of events, and there is a feeling that the leaders have sold the country out to the Russians. There is no one left to turn to. Even Dubcek is now usu ally dismissed as one of them, since the people have simply lost faith in Communism Dubcek's liberal brand, too. The threat of anew round of “show” trials applies only to a small group of intellectuals who were prominent in politi cal and cultural life in 1968. The rest of the population just does not care. EVEN the jokes reflect the change in atmosphere from the days when only the Rus sians were the bad guys. Now people are saying that things in Czechoslovakia will im prove when Strougal's widow goes to see Husak in jail to tell him that Brezhnev died of a heart attack at Ulbricht's funeral. The machinations of poli ticians have always been the butt of jokes in Czechoslo vakia. The harder the times, the funnier the jokes. Rus sians are funny, but Russians are also powerful, and many Czech jokes about them are imbued with a great deal of wishful. thinking that they would somehow just vanish. When the Russians first came to Prague, signs scribbled on walls read: “Go home, Ivan. Natasha has a Chinese boy friend.” Later, the mes sage got a bit more pointed: “Did you hear the Russians have landed on the moon?” says one man. “AU of them?” asks the other, hopefully. For a period of about two weeks last winter, every other person was asking me if I had heard about Dubcek's trip to Moscow. It seems Dubcek went to Moscow and found the city completely deserted.. Brezhnev was lying dead in his office. “And do you know what happened then?” people would ask. “No. What happened?” “I don't know either, but it's a nice story.” One of the most dramatic repercussions of the invasion of Czechoslovakia has been the altered relationship—es pecially on a personal level—between traditionally fraternal Slav nations. On the Czecho slovak side, the reservoir of good feeling for the Russians that remained from World War II was unequivocally de stroyed. We visited some friends in the country and drank homemade wine in their “English salon”—a small ‐den decorated with mementos from a recent trip to London. Then our hosts showed us their “Russian salon,” which featured a wall‐sized portrait of Stalin. It was the outhouse. It is hard to say what the effects of the invasion have been on the Russian side, especially since Russian sol diers in Czechoslovakia are still kept at a safe distance from the hostile local popula tion. Nevertheless, a friend of mine did manage to question a young Russian soldier sta tioned outside Prague about his feelings toward the in vasion. “At first I thought it was wrong for us to come here,” said the Russian. “But now I realize that there was a counterrevolution in this coun try. All those kids with long hair and beards! I saw work ers driving cars. In Russia, honest workers don't have cars. But what really con vinced me was that many workers had their own dachas in the country. Everybody knows that workers who have dachas are in the pay of for eign governments.” The Czechoslovaks feel in finitely superior to their “primitive” Russian brothers —culturally and economically. No matter how bad things are at home, they can always be confident in the knowledge ?? that things are far worse in Russia. “Why did the Russians fail to stage their traditional mili tary parade on May Day of 1969? “Because all the Russian troops with boots were in Czechoslovakia.” The Czechoslovaks say that no matter what the Corrunu nists do, they will never make Russians out of Czechs and Slovaks. Their greatest fear is that they are wrong. BUT if the Czechoslovaks don't want to be Russian, they don't want to be American either—or French, or Swedish, or Japanese. Ask them how they can live in a Communist society with no freedom and they will ask how you can live in a competitive, commercial ized, deodorized society with crime, strikes and demon strations. Many a Czechoslo vak emigre, lured westward by visions of glittering sports cars and the sunny, surfboard cluttered beaches of Cali fornia, has returned home to the comfort of hot sausages in Wenceslaus and the easy going, comfortable life he is accustomed to. In the final analysis, most Czechs want to stay Czech and make the best of it—no matter what. And make the best of it they do. “It's the worst of times,” said Zuzana. “It's a time for crying. But these people are laughing. That's why I love them.” Beneath the Lenin posters, life goes on pretty much as al ways. If you have money and ‘known people,’ you can still do everything you want,” said Eva. “Communists. Nazis. It's all the same.” Eva needed a visa for France. The price that her “known person” was ask ing was two bottles of a cer tain cognac available only at the embassy of a Western country. A friend managed to get the cognac by presenting another known person with a bottle of perfume. Eva got her visa. And the friend was re imbursed for the cognac in Czechoslovak crowns at three times the official rate of ex change. Two years after the Rus sian invasion, there is still pro test in Czechoslovakia. But it is almost entirely personal and negative. Two major occasions for student protest in 1968—Oct. 28 and Nov. 7 — passed practically without notice in 1969. On Nov. 7, Czechoslo vak and Russian flags waved on all trams and government buildings. It was the anniver sary of the Bolshevik victory in the Soviet Union. In one pub, people were chanting “Dubcek, Dubcek,” and saying unprintable things about Dr. Husak. This can now bring a prison sentence, so we had to leave. Outside, the wind rattled the shutters on a house across the street. “Dwarfs,” said Slavek. “Dwarfs are the only ones celebrating tonight. But there are many dwarfs in Czechoslo vakia. Mental dwarfs.” We found a small under ground tavern where people were dancing waltzes and polkas, drinking Moravian wine, and singing national songs. Somebody asked for the time. It was 10 minutes past midnight. “Good,” he said. “Now we can take down those stupid flags.” But nobody did. At the Semaphor theater in Prague, a particularly enthu siastic audience response usu ally signals that a political reference has been made. After one performance which brought an unusual amount of applause, I asked one of the players how he could afford to be so political in such dan gerous times. “We aren't po litical,” he said. “The people are reading things between the lines which aren't there.” But if there is less protest, there is also a lot less self congratulatory back ‐slapping over how the clever Czechs got the better of those stupid Russians—Schweik‐style. Sla vek told me disgustedly, “Our people have no... no...”—and pointed to his backbone. A young student complained that most Westerners gave the Czechoslovaks too much credit for being the heroic Davids fighting the Russian Goliath. “Most people don't care one way or the other,” he said. “They're only interested in making money and watching TV—like my parents.” A Czech man goes to the police station to complain that three Swiss soldiers just stole his Russian watch. “Don't you mean, three Rus sian soldiers just stole your Swiss watch?” “You said it, I didn't.” AT a soccer match in Prague, the man sitting behind us became so angry with the referee that he shouted “Husak” at him in a most de rogatory manner. (Husak, in Czech, means “goose.”) The people around us smiled shyly, like frightened schoolchildren when the class jester sticks his tongue out behind the teacher's back. Although they are happy conspirators in this courageous defiance of au thority, they know that if the teacher catches the culprit, the whole class will have to stay after school. But the fear is not what it was in the Novotny era—and never will be again. Eight months of freedom of the press under Dubcek was fol lowed by two years of politi cal uncertainty when outspok en protest survived to a truly incredible extent. It was plenty of time to leave an in delible stamp. A pervasive, if not clearly articulated, senti ment exists that giving in to the fear amounts to collabora tion, since fear is exactly what the authorities have set out to achieve. Recently, in a Prague movie house, the pre‐movie newsreel showed Husak kissing Brezh nev on the cheek. “You forgot his —‐!” came a shout from the audience. The man ager appeared on stage and requested that the comrade who had made the impolite remark please leave the the ater. The newsreel was shown again from the beginning. When the kiss scene flashed on the screen, the whole audience yelled, “You forgot his —‐!” Of course, the outlets for protest are fewer and fewer. Theater performances are now being censored for improper audience reaction. That means you are not allowed to laugh in the wrong places. Even the graffiti have been appropri ated. “Long live Dr. Husak and the Red Army,” reads a sign “scribbled” in white paint on Narudova Street. Almost all the old Dubcek signs have been painted over. Two years ago, when the Russians first came to Czecho slovakia, a young girl named Maria was shot down while crossing the street by a panicky Russian soldier. A small plaque was‐mounted on a cement wall to commemo rate her death. Recently, the plaque was removed and tall flowers were planted to hide the bare spot on the wall. The girl never died. The invasion never happened.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ABORTIONS PROVIDED AT MILITARY BASES,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/18/archives/abortions-provided-at-military-bases.html,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 17 (UPI) —United States military base hospitals around the world must provide abortion and sur gical sterilization services ft all armed forces personnel and their dependents regardless of state or local laws, the Defense Department said today. Abortions may be obtained at a base hospital if two physi cians, or one physician and psychiatrist, agree it is neces sary, officials said. “There are no other restric tions,” a spokesman said. “Mar ital status is not a factor. Any one can get these or other fam ily planning services as he or she meets the requirements of the policy.” The only charge is for hos pitalization required for abor tions or sterilizations, at $1.75 a day.

Women's Liberation Unit Gives Details of Its Nationwide Protest,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/19/archives/womens-liberation-unit-gives-details-of-its-nationwide-protest.html,"The coordinators of next week's Women's Strike for Equality announced plans yes terday for nationwide demon strations ranging from “baby ins” to marches and rallies to dramatize their goal of achiev ing “the unfinished business of our equality.” The “strike”—which its orig inator, Betty Friedan, empha sized was not designed to be a strike in the traditional labor union sense—is scheduled for Aug. 26, the 50th anniversary of‐the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote. The strike has three central demands—equal opportunity in employment and education, free abortion on demand and the establishment of free, commu nity‐controlled 24‐hour child care centers. Although these are the is sues that Gloria Steinem, a writer who is a member of the coordinating committee, called “the heart of the strike,” other members defined its less tangi ble goals from different an gles. ‘Mrs. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the chairman of the city's Commission on Human Rights, saw it as a way of “serving notice [to employers] that they can no longer get away with” job discrimination against wom en. Bella Abzug, a Democratic Candidate for the House of Rep resentatives, called it “a state ;dent and, commitment from the Women of Anierica that the oppressed majority are coming into their political own.” Rally in Bryant Park The highlight of the observ ances in New York City, where as elsewhere it is expected that some women may stay off the job, is a 5:30 P.M. rally in Bryant Park. The participants will march at 7:30 P.M. from a rallying point at Fifth Ave nue and 59th Street to the park, which is bounded by Fifth Ave nue, the Avenue of the Amer icas, and 42d and 40th Streets. There will also be a “dia logue” in City Hall Park be tween women and those city and state officials who accept the committee's invitation to be present. “The men are invited,” Mrs. griedan said, “but they will 4iscuss what we want to dis cuss on our terms.” A model child‐care center will be set up in the park, where women may leave their babies while they take part in demonstrations. Similar “baby ins” are planned in a number of other cities, the organizers said, including Syracuse, where children will be brought to City Hall “to point out to local legislators and Mayor the lack of day‐care centers and how little women can accomplish with children around them all day.” Rallies are also planned in Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco. A department‐store boycott is planned in Washing ton, and Gov. Marvin Mandel's office will be picketed in An apolis, Md., to protest his veto of that state's abortion‐reform bill. The battle for women's suf frage will be recalled in many cities, including Chicago and Los Angeles, with women dressed in clothing of the era. It is hoped by the strike's sponsors, that women all over the country who took part in the fight for the vote will join the demonstrations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Liberation Yesterday—The Roots of the Feminist Movement.,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/21/archives/liberation-yesterdaythe-roots-of-the-feminist-movement.html,"“We did all those things. I went swimming nude and worse things than that, but we did them privately. They do them publicly and I think that's a mistake,” said Dorothy Kenyon, a former Municipal Court judge and still a practicing lawyer at the age of 82. “Everything they talk about we talked about before 1914,” asserted Jeannette Rankin, a consistent pacifist who was the first woman elected as a United States Representative and who voted against American entry into both World Wars. Miss Rankin turned 90 last June. “They” are the women's liberation movement, the latest assorted regiments of feminists whose exploits from topless swimming and barroom sitting to vociferous demands for equal treatment with men have kept them in the headlines and on the television and cocktail chatter circuit. If there is a generation gap in feminism as there among students and blacks, it yawns between the young cadres of 20 and 30 and their mothers, who have been accused of letting the revolution lapse. The takeover generation of female activists on the whole revere the founding grandmothers and maiden grandaunts who have languished for nearly half a century in the histor ical garret reserved for eccentrics and those who arrived too early or late on the battlefields. On the eve of the 50th anniversary of woman's suf frage, however, a sprightly octogenarian has every right to claim her laurels. The suffragettes won their victory by “making scene,” as one male political writer said on Aug. 26, 1920. They paraded and picketed, lit liberty bonfires, had their fingers broken by the police, were arrested, went to jail and on hunger strikes. Only in retrospect, perhaps, they protested in style. “Our skirts were to the ankles,” said Mrs. Arthur Schlesinger Sr., a widow and mother of historians. Radcliffe women's archives are named after her and her husband. The suffragettes marched under banners of purple, gold and scarlet that bore such incendiary messages as “resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.” “We always tried to make our lines as beautiful as we could and our banners were really beautiful,” maintained Alice Paul, “the pale wraith” and brilliant organizer who founded the National Wo man's Party, the militant wing of the suffrage move ment. Her card system on legislators was credited with steamrolling the 72‐year‐old campaign for the woman's vote through Congress. Miss Paul was arrested seven times in the United States and in England, once for demonstrating across from the White House as part of cause alive in front or President Wooarow Wilson ana the nation. “We never did anything but make speeches, beautiful speeches, but we never got to finish them because soon as a person opened her mouth she got arrested,” recalled Miss Paul, who can be forgiven if, at 85 and still going strong for the equal rights Constitutional amendment she proposed in 1923, she forgets that 60 years ago she broke a window of a banquet hall to gain Prime Minister Herbert Asquith's attention. It was in England that this banker's daughter learned the technique of militancy from those British feminists, the Pankhurst sisters. Miss Paul was first arrested there and forcibly fed behind bars. Then it seemed a disagreeable experience, “but it's soon over,” she said the other day in Washing ton, and “I'd rather talk about now. I think it's a good idea to forget the past.” But the past containe unresolved question of the future. Is the wons in rights movement destined to con tinue as the greatest talkathon of modern times or will it achieve the transformation of modern society and the genuine enuality between the sexes that has been its con stant goal? From Lucretia Mott to Betty Friedan, feminists have been indefatigably verbal. Everything said today has in deed been said and written before: In 1837, Susan B. Anthony, then a 17‐year‐old teacher, was asking for equal pay for women teachers, coeduca tion and higher education for women. In 1848, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and other abolitionist women assembled at Seneca Falls, N. Y., and asserted a declaration of principles that “all men and women are equal.” But, they added, man has established “absolute tyranny” over woman. In the 1970 vocabulary of radical feminism, man is male chauvinist, a sexist and an oppressor. “Radical reform” was what Miss Anthony and Mrs. Stanton expected their magazine, The Revolution, further in 1868. “Educated suffrage, irrespective of sex or color; equal pay to women for equal work; eight hours labor; abolition of standing armies and party despotism. Down with politicians—Up with the people!” they asked in language that seems startlingly contemporary. But then feminism has always seemed visionary. It has always swung from revolution to reaction, propelled on spasmodic bursts of energy toward astonishing achieve ment before subsiding into compromise and indifference., The parallels between the decades and the centuries are numerous. The first 19th century feminists noticed their shackles while seeking emancipation for Negro slaves. But after black freedmen gained the vote white abolitionist women were able to Isolate their cause. The present sisterhood honed its skills in the mid‐20th century movements of civil rights, peace and radical poli tics. Current historians of feminism, such as Caroline Bird, whose 1968 book, “Born Female,” is being reissued by David McKay, emphasize the kinship between women and blacks as second‐class citizens. “In the beginning we said if black people behave like white people we'll give them equality, but then we saw that blacks were handicapped from the outset and maybe we'd have to change our concept of society to include black people in the ways they are different,” Miss Bird, said, going on to point out that the women's movement, even in the two years since her book was published, has passed from harping on equal opportunity in work changes in sex roles and the restructuring of the family. “The women's movement has followed the blacks its splinters. There are feminine separatists as there are black separatists,” she added. Indeed there are the feminists who will have nothing to do with men except appear on their television shows, and other liberated women who marry, cohabit with and mother the children of men but insist on their taking a back seat in a woman‐led Feminist movement. But then feminism has always been faction‐prone. It always had its separatists, starting with Lucy Stone, who kept her name after marrying Henry Blackwell in 1855 in a re markable ceremony that con travened all of the legal ob ligations of the nuptial rite. Today some feminists deny any man's name including their father's. There were al ways the militants and the conservatives, the radicals and the reformers, the single minded suffragists and broad gauge social reconstruction ists. Victoria Woodhull published the first American translation of “The Commu nist Manifesto” and was later accused of trying to sabotage the First Interna tional for feminist deviation ism. Because of the bitter rivalry between Alice Paul and Carrie Chapman Catt, neither witnessed the signing of the suffrage proclamation. landmark for decline. Many feminists, old and new, acknowledged that counterrevolution followed. “We got sidetracked and discovered to our astonish ment that when you got the vote you were not thereby made a full‐fledged citizen. It was a horrible discovery,” Dorothy Kenyon admits. “After 1920, a genuine wave reaction set in.” Not all would agree. Many social reforms, such women and child labor laws, the planned parenthood and abortion causes as well as the civil rights and peace move ments, were furthered by the resolute prodding of women acting as individuals or through such organizations as the National Council of Women and the Women's City Club. Nevertheless, given the ballot, women (including the suffrage leaders) neglected to take political leadership. Mrs. Catt'S League of Women Voters became a non partisan, educational body of middle‐class housewives who declined to commit themselves to the issues of their time. “They never did anything on civil rights; I never for gave them for that,” Mrs. Schlesinger, an early member, said. “The league should practice politics in its own back yard.” During the half century after suffrage, women's par ticipation in the professions and the higher echelons business slumped to the point where today only 1 per cent of engineers, 3 per cent of lawyers and 9 per cent of scientists are women. The average woman with a col lege degree earns imperceptibly more than a man without a high school education and about 40 per cent less than a male college graduate. Only in this latest crest of liberation ardor are women insisting on being Secret Service agents and bartenders and to be freed from protective legislation that keeps them on the lowest‐paid rungs of the industrial ladder. Following World War II and its slight advances, which brought women into the armed forces and onto the riv eter's bench, American wo men retreated again to do mesticity and compulsive motherhood. With her book, “The Feminine Mystique,” largely addressed to the col lege ‐educated housewife, Betty Friedan dusted off the feminist banners again in 1963. Two years later, Title 7, prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of sex was added to the Civil Rights Act of 1965, partly as a joke, partly as a Southern obstructionist tactic. In 1966 Mrs. Friedan helped to or ganize NOW, the National Organization for Women, “the new movement for true equality for all women in America and toward a fully equal partnership of the sexes.” During the next few years the younger and more radical women began to form in free‐flowing groups under such striking titles as Red Stockings, Bitch and WITCH (Women's Interna tional Terrorist Conspiracy phase, the women's liberation movement has criticized itself for being too white, middle‐class and intellectual as were its ancestor feminists. Actually, the early 20th‐century movement was an amalgam of such social leaders as Ann Morgan and Mrs. Oliver H. P. Belmont, such social workers as Jane Addams and Frances Perkins, and such working women as Rose Schneiderman, president of the Women's Trade Union League. Even as the ‘movement proceeds with renewed vigor, more or less united, to celebrate next Wednesday's an niversary with a strike, differences of philosophy and tactics persist. Not all favor the Equal Rights Amendment, Some fear that the protective legislation It will remove will, hurt more women than it will help. But Miss Kenyon, who fought it for years because she considered it redundan and also preferred to have the United States Supreme Court recognize female equality under the 14th Amend ment, now believes “we better have the Equal Rights Amendment in a hurry because I'm afraid the Supreme Court is going in a backward wave ‐for the next 20 years.” Some of the senior activists deplore some of the youthful tangents. “I can't see how fighting to enter McSorley's Is victory,” Mrs. Schlesinger said. “And why does being, braless give you freedom? Can't they see that in all this commune living they are sex objects?” “I think they make too much about sex,” Miss Kenyon said. But as for karate, she concludes: “Now that takes away from men the last vestige of genuine difference. They always surpassed us in horsepower. If we have karate, we have that, too.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Coming Wednesday,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/23/archives/coming-wednesday-a-herstorymaking-event-demonstrations-and-parades.html,"“This is not a war to be fought in the bedroom, but in the city, in the political arena.”—BETTY FRIEDAN, in a speech last March 20 in Des Plaines, Ill., calling for a 24 hour general strike by women. ON Wednesday, the wo men will take to the streets. There may be handfuls, there may be hun dreds, or there may be, as Miss Friedan confidently pre dicts, “millions and millions of women, doing their own thing and making ‘herstory’—instead of history.” The herstory‐making event will be called the Women's Strike for Equality, and the banners will be lively: “Don't Iron While the Strike Is Hot!” and “Only Four Women in the Bronx Earn Over $10,000,” and “Why Doesn't the Man Take the Pill?”, among others. The strike, sponsored by a coalition of women's groups, will not be held during the hottest part of the year for nothing. Wednesday just hap pens to be the 50th anniver sary of the 19th Amendment, which gives women the vote. But to the strike organiz ers, anybody who actually thinks that the planned pa rades, demonstrations and guerrilla theater actions have anything to do with women being happy about their right to vote for 50 years is prob ably either a fool, or a male chauvinist—or both. As the women see it, they just haven't come a very long way since 1920, baby, and the strike is intended to air their major grievances and let American womanhood know that the sisterhood is (it is hoped) powerful. “Our goal,” said Miss Frie dan, the national strike co ordinator, who probably started the women's libera tion movement back in 1963 when her book, “The Femi nine Mystique,” was published, “is to make women aware of their power, and the fact that they can use this power to make changes in the world. “And if changes aren't made,” she added, in a deadly serious tone, “I'm afraid that what could happen with women might make the race riots in Detroit look like child's play.” HERE are some of the things that will happen Wednesday, if Miss Friedan and her committee have their way: Wives will refuse to cook for husbands. Waitress es will stop waiting, and cleaning women will stop cleaning. Secretaries will keep their typewriters covered and close their notebooks, and telephone operators will un plug their switchboards. Like most big‐time demon strations, the strike has an official button (a white medi cal symbol for woman with a clenched fist in the center, on a blood‐red background), an official song (“Liberation, Now!”), official posters (too numerous to describe), and three official demands: (1) Free abortion on de mand. (2) Free 24‐hour child care centers—community con trolled. (3) Equal opportunity in jobs and education. These are the issues that bring fire to feminists eyes and placards to their hands. The issues are so much at the heart of the whole movement, in fact, that lighthearted at tempts by male newsmen to equate the strike with the women's sex strike in the Greek play “Lysistrata” (411 B. C.) often result in a flur ry of four and 12‐letter words from strike leaders’ mouths. (One headline par ticularly infuriates them: “Women to Fold Their Arms Like Lysistrata.”) Although some of the fem inists have vowed to withhold sex from their men on Wednesday, most regard ab stention as an unimportant part of the day's activities. “It's irrelevant,” scoffed Ruth ann Miller, 23, a cherub‐faced Trotskyite Communist who was one of the leaders in plan ning the Manhattan demon strations. “You might know that men would want to talk about sex when we're talking about important things — like child care, and women dying from abortions.” Although demonstrations and parades are planned for at least 40 cities, the strike coalition expects the media's attention to be focused on the Manhattan actions. These in clude: A noon “dialogue” with politicians on the steps of City Hall: a 5:30 P.M. pa rade down Fifth Avenue from 59th Street to Bryant Park, where speakers will discuss the three demands; and an 8 P. M. victory celebration (at $5 a person) at the Village Gate nightclub in Greenwich Village. Throughout the day, small er actions will be held all over the city by the various women's groups participating in the strike—National Or ganization for Women (NOW), Young Women's Christian As sociation, New York Radical Feminists, Redstockings, Rad ical Lesbians, National Coali tion of American Nuns, National Welfare Rights Or ganization, Older Women's Liberation, Feminists in the Arts, WITCH (Women's In ternational Terrorist Con spiracy from Hell), Women Strike for Peace and Colum bia Women's Liberation. Their actions, for the most part, will be humorous. NOW plans to erect a mock statue of a woman in “a famous Manhattan park” because, according to a NOW leader, “the only statue of a woman in New York, besides the Statue of Liberty, is the one of Alice in Wonderland in Central Park.” (The Statue of Liberty was liberated earlier this month amid banners—“Women of the World Unite,” “I'm a second‐class citizen”—and skits. The argument was that a woman should not rep resent liberty in a country where women are so op pressed.) Several groups plant to hold “Tot‐Ins” by dumping babies on the laps of employers and politicians to demonstrate the need for child‐care centers. “Freedom trash cans” will be set up all over the city, where symbols of women's denigra tion can be thrown. “Like aprons and dish towels,” Miss Friedan said at one of the planning sessions at strike headquarters, 229 Lexington Avenue. “Or husbands,” chimed in a voice from the rear. Teams of women are plan ning to ride around Manhat tan in taxis, stopping to pre sent “male supremacist” awards to such companies as General Motors, The New York Times, General Electric and American Telephone and Telegraph. Other groups will stage guerrilla theater actions showing how women have been disfigured and injured by cosmetics and drugs such as The Pill. In stores and supermarkets, consumer boy cotts will be started against the products of companies that discriminate against and exploit women. In Miss Friedan's eyes, the spirit of the strike will not be dampened by the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment by the U.S. House of Repre sentatives on Aug. 10 The amendment, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, had been bottled up in a committee for 47 years; it still has to be passed by the Senate and ratified by three‐fourths of the states before it becomes a part of the Constitution. “I assumed that it would pass by Aug. 26,” Miss Frie dan said. “They had to throw us some kind of bone. But if they think that this means they can keep us quiet and off the streets, they're wrong. The amendment doesn't begin to deal with the three demands of the strike.” THE planning stages of the strike were not without fric tion. There was feuding, back biting and name‐calling, which many of the women seemed to enjoy. A younger band of radicals, led by Miss Miller, found Miss Friedan's ways of doing things “hope lessly bourgeois.” And Miss Friedan's older, more con servative faction countered by calling the younger women “crazies.” For a while, the two groups had separate headquarters: Miss Miller's on lower Broad way and Miss Friedan's at the Lexington Avenue address. The schism was mended in early August, with most strike leaders willing to concede that Miss Friedan, since she and her friends controlled the purse strings, could have things pretty much her own way. Some organizers even dubbed the strike “Betty's baby.” Miss Friedan said she con ceived the idea of a Women's Strike for Equality while she was flying to Chicago to speak at the fourth annual conference of NOW last March in the O'Hare Inn in Des Plaines. “I was trying to think of something really fantastic to put in a speech I was writ ing,” she said, in a recent in terview in East Hampton, where she spent most of the summer living with three men and one other woman in what she called a “commune.” “Then I remembered some letters I had got from a wo man who teaches history in some college somewhere. I can't remember her name. She had written all sorts of his torical information, including the fact that August 26 would be the 50th anniversary of women getting the right to vote. “We have 53 per cent of the population, and we have the power to make changes.” “That was about the time when women's lib was getting all sorts of attention in the media,” she went on. “It was just like ecology—all of a sudden everybody loved ecol ogy, but nothing was happen ing. So I decided we ought to have some sort of women's strike, one that would show that discrimination still exists in employment and education, and that consciousness is ex ploding in the minds of women.” MISS Friedan issued her strike call to an audience of 250 women that evening of March 20, saying it would be “an instant revolution against sexual oppression.” She also mentioned, much to her re gret now, that women would “sacrifice a night of love to make the political meaning clear.” That statement brought the inevitable com parisons with the “Lysis trata” strike. “I don't consider this move ment a bedroom movement,” she said in East Hampton, “although what happens in the bedroom is going to be affected by the movement. Men have thought of women as sexual objects for too long. It's time we started being judged for ourselves and our accomplishments.” Miss Friedan, looking like a gray‐haired combination of Hermione Gingold and Bette Davis, said she was extreme ly fearful of what could hap pen in the United States if women didn't get equality. A native of Peoria, Ill., and a summa cum laude graduate of Smith College, Miss Friedan is the divorced mother of three children ranging in age from 13 to 21. She is an articulate, nonstop talker who gestures wildly as she speaks. “We have 53 per cent of the population,” she said, “and we have the power to make changes. If we don't change institutions, the rage of women is going to be destructive. I especially worry about this anti‐man attitude. It's dehumanizing, and it re sults in the dehumanization of sex. I also worry about fascism springing up among women. In the Southwest and various other parts of the country, women are the life blood of the reactionary movement” The first New York strike meeting was held on June 15, when about 30 women from the various women's groups met at noon in the National Conference of Christians and Jews headquarters, 43 West 57th Street. The women sat in a circle, and the meeting, like those to follow, was con ducted in the participatory democracy style first advo cated by the Students for a Democratic Society. At that first meeting, and in the weekly ones that fol lowed, the women who showed up resembled a cross section of New York's female population. There were dumpy, gray‐haired grand mother types who arrived at the meetings toting shopping bags. There were braless, long‐haired teenyboppers in T‐shirts and jeans. There were well‐groomed Pucci‐ed and Gucci‐ed women who looked as though they had just left the bridge table in Rye. And there were always a few blacks—but never more than a handful. “When you're a black wo man, it's like double jeopardy,” explained Carole Taylor, 25, of the women's unit of Gov ernor Rockefellees office, at one of the gatherings. “We have the problem of being both black and female. But for most of us, the black move ment comes first.” During many of the June and July meetings, things were going so badly that it looked as though it would take a miracle to bring the strike off on Aug. 26. Miss Friedan and Miss Miller quar reled over the length of the Fifth Avenue parade route. Miss Miller, a candi date for State Controller on the Socialist Workers par ty ticket, is the wife of a printer, but she refuses the prefix “Mrs.” and wears her wedding ring on her right hand. She won the debate with Miss Friedan. (Miss Mil ler wanted the parade to run from 59th Street to 42d Street, and on into Bryant Park; Miss Friedan wanted it to start at 110th Street so the women of Harlem wouldn't feel left out.) Occasionally the young radical women would chat loudly among themselves while Miss Friedan was lead ing meetings, causing her at one point to yell at the top of her lungs, “Isn't there anyone interested in child care?” One meeting was disrupted when three young men‐tried to crash it, saying they want ed to learn how to start an organization to liberate men. At another session, Juliette Gordon, the art chairman, walked out in a huff when a rather flowery button design she had submitted was turned down by the coalition for not being simple enough. That meeting was salvaged, however, when the women heard for the first time the Decca recording of the strike's theme song, “Libera tion, Now!” The song, which has a bouncy, rock‐revivalist sound and was recorded by an all‐girl sextet called “Hope of the Future,” goes like this: Liberation, now Liberation, now We're breaking out of our cage Of ruffles and rage Liberation, now Femininity What's femininity? Masculinity What's masculinity? It's humanity—that we both share Liberation, now Liberation, now It's time to spell our own names We're people, not “dames” Liberation, now. The words were written by Miss Friedan and Jacquelyn Reinach, vice president of Discobook, Inc., a record production company; the mu sic by Miss Reinach and J. Rene. And who is J. Rene? “It's Joe Rene, a man,” said Miss Reinach, an ebullient, husky‐voiced blonde. “We didn't use his full name be cause we didn't want to make waves. We thought some women might not like it.” One question that constant ly sprang up during the plan ning sessions was whether it was correct to call the strike a “strike.” The strike organ izers reasoned that since many women probably wouldn't have the nerve to skip work Wednesday, per haps the strike should be called a lash‐out, or a demon stration, or a commitment. “They wouldn't dare fire us if we all called in sick,” a girl in an orange pants suit suggested. “We could give one of our usual excuses—that we have cramps or some thing.” Finally, it was de cided that the coalition would not demand that women stay away from work, only sug gest it, and that women should spend August 26 doing their own thing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8 PARTIES SEEK PLACE ON BALLOT,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/23/archives/8-parties-seek-place-on-ballot-deadline-passes-for-filing-petitions.html,"ALBANY, Aug. 22—Petitions that would put at least 12 parties on the state ballot in the November general elections were registered here by yes terday, the filing deadline. The office of the New York Secretary of State has until Sept. 24 to certify the names of the candidates and parties that will appear on the ballots. The four major parties—Democratic, Republican, Con servative and Liberal — are exempt from the petition‐filing procedure because they drew sufficient votes in the last state wide election but the minor parties are required to submit 12,000 signatures, with at least 50 from each county, counting “Fulton and Hamilton counties as one. This is the first year since 1932 that the Communist party has nominated a candidate for Governor Rasheed Storey, 34 years old, of Brooklyn, the party's state chairman, will be running under the symbol of hammer and sickle clasped by black and white hands. Also nominated under the Communist banner with Mr. Storey were Grace Mora New man, 43, of the Bronx, for Lieu tenant Governor; Arnold John son, 65, of Manhattan, a national officer of the party, for United States Senator, and Jose Ste vens, 24, a party organizer, for United States Representative from Harlem. Symbol Is a Fetus The Right to Life party, which has the symbol of a baby in the womb and seeks repeal of the state's new abor tion‐reform law, has nominated Mrs. Jane Gilroy, 34, of Mer rick, L. I., for Governor, and Mrs. Marcia Pilsner, 31, of Sea ford, L. I., for Lieutenant Gov ernor. The Courage party, which two years ago sponsored George Wallace for President in this state, has nominated Albert Bushong of Rome for Governor and Robert P. Shields of Flush ing, Queens, for Lieutenant Governor. The Socialist Labor party nominated as its candidates Stephen Emery, 62, of New York City for Governor; Ar nold Babel, 34, of Freeport, L. I., for Lieutenant Governor; John Emanuel, 41, of New York City for United States Senator, and Walter Steinhil ber, 73, for Controller. A Party to Aid Buckley The Independent Alliance party was formed to give the United States Senator, James L. Buckley, a second line on the ballot. The Conservation party was formed for a similar purpose, offering a second line to the Democratic candidate for United States Senate, Repre sentative Richard L. Ottinger, Democrat of Westchester Coun ty. It is being challenged by the Conservative party because of the similarity of names. The Civil Service‐Independ ents party will give Governor Rockefeller and Lieut. Gov. Malcolm Wilson, the Republican candidates, a second line on, the ballot.

Religion,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/23/archives/religion-when-the-priest-leaves-the-pulpit-for-the-stump.html,"At their semi‐annual meeting in San Francisco last April, the Catholic bishops of the United States reminded priests that “an old church law” — Canon 139. discouraging clergy from run ning for public office — was still in effect. The reminder was prompted by yet another phe nomenon of the evolving Ameri can Catholic church: the trans formation, almost overnight, of the Catholic priest from politi cal bystander to political can didate. Protestant ministers have fre quently doubled as elected po litical officials, but the Catholic priest, rather like the Jewish rabbi, rarely went beyond voting —until last winter. Nationwide Trend Then suddenly, from Califor nia to Vermont, Catholic priests were announcing for virtually every level of political office: state legislatures, the Governor ship of Colorado, Senator from Rhode Island, numerous seats in the House of Representatives. If these priest‐candidates heard the bishops’ admonition, they weren't exactly brought to heel. All continued their cam paigning. The only ones to fall by the wayside were those de feated in the spring primaries. It is poll‐time again. Resum ing on Sept 15, primary day in Massachusetts, voters will de termine the fate of the priest aspirants and, in so doing, de cide whether the politicizing of the American Catholic clergy is to acquire its full dimension or be limited for another election to political involvements short of the actual holding of office. Of the aspirants for the more prestigious offices, none has spectacular prospects, including the two most publicized candi dates — Jesuit Father Robert F. Drinan, the provocative liberal dean (on leave) of Boston Col lege Law School, and Jesuit Fa ther John McLaughlin, a 43‐year‐old Republican‐liberal and former associate editor of Amer ica, the journal of opinion spon sored by his religious order. Last Friday, Father McLaughlin ran into official opposition from the Bishop of Providence; he criti cized him in a front‐page edi torial in the diocesan paper, claiming that his candidacy had “caused a great deal of confu sion and misunderstanding.” And in Boston, it isn't only Father Drinan who is running. Inner city priest Father John White is aspiring to succeed re tiring Speaker of the House John W. McCormack, and Father Mimie B. Pitaro, an East Boston pas tor, is running for the State Legis lature. Whatever their chances of success, the candidacies of Fa thers Drinan and McLaughlin and the other priests are not without secular and ecclesiastical signif icance. Win, lose or draw, old political equations will never be quite the same again. The Ro man Catholic priest is a new component of political life in America. The priest‐politician will be part of the future. There seems to be no special church‐state problem about this. Only Maryland and Tennessee re tain old statutes limiting the po litical activity of clergymen, and those laws appear to be on the way out. The fact is that clergy men have been in and out of public office, including the Con gress, at least since 1789, when Frederick A. C. Muhlenberg of Pennsylvania, a Lutheran pastor, served as first Speaker of the House. Three members of the 91st Congress are ordained clergy men: Adam Clayton Powell, De mocrat of New York, a National Baptist; John H. Buchanan, Re publican of Alabama, a Southern Baptist, and Henry C. Schedeberg, Republican of Wisconsin, a for mer Congregational pastor. And just last. Wednesday, the Demo cratic Senatorial nomination in Connecticut went to the Rev. Joseph D. Duffey, a United Church of Christ minister. There is even Catholic prec edent for a priest being in the Congress. Father Gabriel Rich ard was elected a nonvoting Representative from Michigan Territory in 1822. Voters’ Bias Noted In fact, such Catholic problem as there is exists largely in the biases of the Catholic voter. This seems especially so at the moment, given vacancies in the ranks of the Catholic clergy. Not a few find it impossible to understand why Father should want to be a politician when there's so much to be done in the church. Negativeness goes up the line and afflicts some conservative Catholics virulently. Father Dan iel Lyons, S.J., of the Catholic weekly Twin Circle, believes that priest‐candidacies “confuse the faithful” and “stir up hostil ity” against the church. Elmer Von Felt, editor of Columbia, of ficial journal of the Knights of Columbus, sees the matter as one of priests “abandoning the rectory... to seek service with Caesar.” The intensity of the latter feel ings may not be typical, but they are reflective of a broad antipathy to the thought of priests in politics. A Boston Globe survey of last May found that 35 per cent of the area's Catholics consider it improper for a priest to run for public office. The figure drops to 26 per cent among non‐Catholics. Some of this antipathy is tinged with anticlericalism. “They've run the parishes into debt,” remarked a Massachusetts attorney who is a born Catholic. “They may as well run the gov ernment into debt, too.” Some is tentative. A Provi dence native who practices law in New York is influenced by the fact that “any politician run ning for office must advertise and exploit himself and his per sonality.” This, he declares, is not proper for a priest—“under ordinary circumstances.” But much more Is vague, and pivots on the intuition that Father's place Is in the sanc tuary. A Wellesley graduate, now in middle age, says, “It is difficult for many Catholics of my generation to get out of their heads that the priest is some thing apart, someone belonging to God.” Actually the emergence of the priest as politician should sur prise no one, bishop or conserva tive layman. It is only a half‐step from the political barricades of the 1960's —civil rights, the birth control and abortion fights, welfare causes and Vietnam — to the political arena itself. The widen ing engagement of Catholic priests had to include eventually the seeking of elective offices. More particularly, the devel opment is a natural concomitant, in a way, of Vatican Council II, one thrust of which has been to involve more Catholics in more secular affairs. The Council Decree on the Ministry and Life of Priests did not grapple with the role of priests in political life; it wasn't an especially live issue at the time of the Council. However, another Council document, the weightier Constitution on the Church in the Modem World, emphatically urged “those who are suited for it, or can become so, [to] prepare themselves for the difficult but most honorable art of politics.” The Modern World statement obviously had lay people in mind. But who's to press that point when the ancient distinc tions between clergy and laity are slipping away one by one, and when it is the priest rather than the layman who is begin ning to think he is a second class Catholic saddled with re strictions? In a new day of clerical—dependence—when priests in creasingly feel free to marry and defy all the old strictures—the independence of priests to seek pontical office must be taken for granted. —JOHN DEEDY",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Law Professor Behind,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/23/archives/the-law-professor-behind-ash-soup-pump-and-crash.html,"WASHINGTON, D. C. THE career of John Banzhaf III demonstrates the diversity of what some see as a crusade and others as simply an exciting new branch of the legal profession. Banzhaf, a 29‐year‐old champion of consumer causes, is on the one hand a baiter of powerful corporations and bureaucrats, and, on the other, a specialist in something that has already earned a respectable title—“public interest law.” He crusades under two different hats, as an as sociate professor at George Wash ington University's National Law Center in Washington and as exec utive director of ASH, Action on Smoking and Health, an organization that he created in 1968 as “the legal arm of the antismoking community.” This fall, he will again dispatch groups of his students, dubbed “Banzhaf's Bandits” by the press, on various missions in the nation's cap ital. Inevitably, he is compared with Ralph Nader, inspirational leader of “Nader's Raiders.” In some respects, he seems to be consciously adopting an approach that is at least 90 degrees from Na der's. While the latter is known for what one of his Raiders has termed “an endless capacity for indigna tion,” Banzhaf admits that he does not get himself terribly worked up over his causes. Nader projects an aura of self‐effacement and humili ty, but Banzhaf does quite the op posite. Nader is extremely difficult to contact, while Banzhaf still keeps his listing in the phone directory. The two men, both bachelors, have completely different life styles. Na der, who may be the first secular monk, is now diverting a substantial portion of his earnings to subsidize his own public‐interest legal research group. Banzhaf believes in the good life. He drives a car, dates, takes va cations and would like to have the time to indulge in more creature com forts. He also feels very strongly that public‐interest advocates need not be underpaid. Including his pay as a law professor and an $18,000‐a‐year sal ary from ASH, his earnings now ap proximate $35,000 annually. Banzhaf and Nader have met but are not in close contact or coordi nation. They have already taken somewhat opposing sides on one issue, smoking on airlines. Nader pe titioned the Federal Aviation Admin istration to ban smoking altogether for reasons of safety. Banzhaf and his students filed a petition stressing the rights of the nonsmoker and ar guing for segregated smoking com partments. The F.A.A. denied Na der's petition and is considering a ruling favorable to Banzhaf's posi tion. Meanwhile, Nader is appealing to the courts. Banzhaf works out of a pair of tiny offices at the law school. ASH, which gets funds from health groups as well as doctors and other individ uals, pays for his two secretaries, who help administer the antismoking legal action campaign. One wall of the narrow cul‐de‐sac corridor which leads to his base of operations is vir tually papered with his press clip pings. “Proof of his oversized ego,” critics charge. “Just something to arouse student interest,” he explains. A casual dresser, he looks younger than many of his students; but for the receding and thinning of his closely cropped brown hair and his recently expanded girth, he would easily pass for a college undergrad uate. His carefully modulated voice, however, exudes a self‐assurance belying the cherubic expression that occasionally brightens his smooth skinned face‐in‐the‐crowd features. It is a self‐assurance appropriate to a man who, while still in law school, convinced the Government that copyright laws should cover compu ter programs; who at the age of 27 filed a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission which eventually forced TV stations to pro vide an estimated $75‐million worth of annual free time for antismoking commercials; and who today is be coming known as one of the most resourceful and controversial of the new public interest, or pro bono publico, advocates. HIS motto is, “Sue the bastards.” As he explains it, “You can often get best results by suing the hell out of people, using all the legal pressure points you can find. And if you're going to spend the rest of your life suing, you might as well sue the bastards.” Students have the opportunity to put this philosophy to work in Banz haf's fall semester course in unfair trade practices. He encourages mem bers of the class to identify some specific unfair practice and to try to do away with it by filing their own complaints with the courts and ad ministrative agencies. The students form groups, to which they give in ventive acronyms as names, and plunge into battle. The group that attracted the most attention last year was SOUP (Stu dents Opposed to Unfair Practices), which attempted to get the Federal Trade Commission to take action against Campbell Soup Company tele vision ads that, SOUP charged, used marbles at the bottom of bowls to make soups appear to hold more solids than they actually contained. The F.T.C. wanted to issue a cease and‐desist consent order and leave it at that. SOUP argued that the com mission should make Campbell run advertising to counter the effects of the deception. The commission ruled 3 to 2 against SOUP, rejecting the students’ bid to participate as consumers in the proceedings against Campbell, and issued a final cease‐and‐desist consent order. However, the majority opinion admitted that the F.T.C. did have the power to issue the type of order SOUP sought. The students view this language as a victory. Moreover, they have just filed a peti  Nader will also teach a seminar at George Washington this September and plans to send out his students on legal action projects, too—thus creat ing a possible intramural rivalry be tween the Bandits and the Raiders. tion for review with the U.S. Court of Appeals, asking again for the right to intervene. A Bandit group called TUBE (Ter mination of Unfair Broadcasting Ex cesses) has filed before the Federal Communications Commission a peti tion for rule‐making that would force the agency to exercise its lawful jurisdiction over TV commercials and set regulatory standards. Up to now the F.C.C. has left the problem of deceptive ads to the F.T.C. If TUBE'S petition is successful, the TV stations themselves will be held responsible by the F.C.C. for policing their own commercials, with penalties for lax ness ranging from fines to license revocation. “If they can black out Abbie Hoffman's flag shirt,” says Banzhaf, “they can exercise the same care about deceptive advertising.” Other student groups include PUMP (Protesting Unfair Marketing Prac tices), which is supporting a pro posed F.T.C. rule requiring gas sta tions to display octane ratings on their pumps; SNOOP (Students Nat urally Opposed to Outrageous Pry ing), which has urged the District of Columbia City Council to police re tail credit agencies in the same man ner in which detective agencies are regulated; and CRASH (Citizens to Reduce Airline Smoking Hazards), which has filed the petition with the Federal Aviation Administration that would require segregated seating for smokers on commercial airlines. THE law school scene in which Banzhaf now operates differs con siderably from the ambience in which he began his legal education. Colum bia Law School in the early nineteen sixties was a pillar of the legal edu cation establishment. The professors on the whole could fit Ralph Nader's description of their Harvard Law counterparts, who he said employed “professorial arrogance as a peda gogical tool.” The predominant mood of much of the student body was, “Let's all go down to Wall Street and make a buck.” Banzhaf was not about to let this atmosphere intimidate him. A gradu ate of M.I.T with a degree in en gineering, he entered the law school in September, 1962, and soon won a reputation as one who would not hesitate to speak his mind in class. By the end of the first year his col leagues were making book on how many oral contributions he would make during each class hour. His first‐year grades were high enough to qualify him for member ship on the Columbia Law Review. Top‐flight legal journals tend to breed pomposity, and the straight ‐laced, tradition‐oriented Columbia Law Re view was no exception. Thus its editors were dismayed to discover that they had a maverick on their hands. Banzhaf's first big project for the Review took advantage of his engi neering background and involved re search into whether computer pro grams could be copyrighted. A stand ard approach would have required first an examination of the copyright laws and the legal decisions inter preting them, and then the develop ment of finely reasoned recommenda tions on how the question should be resolved. Banzhaf went one step fur ther. Since no one had ever tried to copyright a computer program, he decided to make the attempt himself. To his surprise he succeeded, and on May 8, 1964, the news, garnished by his photo, made The New York Times. This was John Banzhaf's first legal action project and his first savor of publicity. He enjoyed both immense ly. Student writings in the Columbia Law Review are published anony mously, however, and so his name did not appear on the note which he subsequently authored. A footnote did refer to the first successful copy righting of a computer program, but did not disclose that this was a direct result of the preparation of the note; nor did it mention the name of the person who had obtained the copy right The Review's tradition of student anonymity did not sit well with Banzhaf, who approached several technical journals in the data‐proc essing field, one of which wanted to reprint the note with his name on it. The board of editors of the Re view, claiming that they had a copy right on everything printed in that journal, refused to grant permission for republication on those terms. They were thoroughly chagrined when their contentious colleague pointed out to them that they had been putting their copyright notice on the wrong page of the Review, and hence none of the articles were legally protected. He then thumbed his nose at the board, rewrote the substance of his note in language comprehensible to a nonlegal audience and had it published under his name in the other journal. THIS was not the only oc casion that Banzhaf piqued his fellow editors. In his sen ior year he decided to write an article applying a mathe matical analysis to weighted voting as a means of reap portionment. He offered to submit it to the Review, but the notion of publishing a full‐length article written and signed by a mere student was unheard of and contrary to all rules and regulations. Un daunted, Banzhaf sent his manuscript to the Rutgers Law Review; which did not hesitate to print it. The Co lumbia editors fussed and fumed and even talked about expelling him from their ranks. As a parting shot, he wrote a tongue‐in‐cheek let ter on abortion to Playboy, and signed it as a former editor of the Columbia Law Review. In June, 1965, John Banzhaf received his law degree mag na cum laude. The presence of a metal plate in his arm, souvenir of a fall from a bi cycle when he was 15, kept him out of the draft. After passing the New York and District of Columbia bar exams, he did a research proj ect on reapportionment for the National Municipal League and then went to work for a year as a law clerk for Judge Spottswood. W. Robinson III of the United States District Court for the District of Co lumbia (now on the United States Court of Appeals for D.C.). During his summer vaca tions while at law school Banzhaf had worked on the social staff of a cruise ship, and after an arduous year with the hard‐working Judge Robin son he went off on a series of short cruises to the Carib bean. Between sailings he stayed at home in the Bronx with his parents, where, while watching football games on television on Thanksgiving in 1966, it dawned upon him that the cigarette commercials which were constantly pop ping into view might be con sidered “controversial” in legal terms. The significance of this moment of inspiration stems from the so‐called “fairness doctrine,” under which the Federal Communications Com mission required radio and TV stations to present fair and adequate treatment of both sides of controversial public issues being aired. “Why not apply the doctrine to cigar ette commercials?” he asked himself, and a week later, be fore leaving on another cruise, he wrote a letter to C.B.S. re questing that the network provide equal time for anti smoking commercials. Upon his return home in late De cember, he fired off a second letter to C.B.S. and on Jan. 5, 1967, in the purser's office of the Swedish‐American Line's M.S. Kungsholm, he typed up a formal complaint which he mailed to the F.C.C. On the next day he set sail on a 92 day cruise of the South Seas. This was the first anti smoking effort for John Banz haf, himself a nonsmoker. “I felt reasonably strong about the problem of smoking and about the misuse of the air waves,” he now reminisces. “And I decided that here was something that I as an indi vidual could do.” After re turning home from his cruise, he went to work for a New York City patent law firm. Two weeks later, to his as tonishment, the F.C.C. upheld his complaint. Subsequent accounts of Banzhaf's crusade have stressed its David vs. Goliath angle. This may be a bit mis leading. At the time he filed his complaint, there were im portant elements within the F.C.C. who were favorably disposed toward the argu ments he was making. The growing concern over smok ing as a cancer risk strength ened the hand of members who disapproved of the habit and the commercials. This does not, of course, diminish his contribution. As one of his friends in the pub lic interest law movement has observed, “John had the abil ity to see certain forces mov ing in certain directions and to seize an idea whose time had come. This is a creative talent—no doubt about it.” Another pro bono specialist has put it more colorfully: “The F.C.C. had within it an ovum, and Banzhaf supplied the sperm.” SHORTLY after the F.C.C. handed down its ruling, a senior partner in Banzhaf's firm informed him for the first time that Philip Morris was one of the firm's clients. At the time this did not seem to be any more than a minor embarrassment, inasmuch as Banzhaf expressed no inten tion to continue what he had set in motion. He hoped to interest one of the established health organizations to carry on the battle, but he found himself unable to persuade them to act. By the end of the summer the F.C.C. was about to entertain petitions from the tobacco and broad casting industries to recon sider its ruling, and Banzhaf had to choose between de fending the ruling or remain ing in the good graces of his law firm, which did not look with favor upon his extracur ricular activities. He chose the former. The F.C.C. denied the pe titions for reconsideration. The National Association of Broadcasters filed an appeal in the United States Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va.—tobacco country—where they calculated they would get a sympathetic hearing. But Banzhaf, in a quick, ingen uous gambit, beat them to the draw. He also had the right to appeal, since the F.C.C. had ruled in his favor on the principle of free time for antismoking commercials, but had turned him down on the request for equal time. Be fore the broadcasters could file their appeal, Banzhaf filed his with the United States Court of Appeals in the Dis trict of Columbia. Under legal procedure, both appeals were thus heard before the appeals court in D.C., which was considered more sympathetic to the public interest, and the strategy paid off when the judges upheld the F.C.C. rul ing. Recalling his decision to leave the practice of the law and pursue his reformist in clinations Banzhaf says today: “I wasn't getting much satis faction from the work I was doing with the firm. Much of it was large corporate stuff. I could seldom identify with the client or the justice of his case. When I got involved with the F.C.C. ruling, I felt that for the first time I was really doing legal work.” He adds: “I wondered why the firm never fired me, but in situations like this you don't get fired, you get eased out. They didn't put any pressure on me, but there was a clear undertone that it would be nice if I would go somewhere else.” LAW students and young lawyers have been for some time expressing their distaste for the profession's traditional preoccupation with represent ing powerful, vested interests, and with what one of their number has termed “the de generation of the large law firms into servicing affiliates of big corporations.” They are re pulsed by travesties such as a recent American Bar Associa tion committee report which opposed allowing consumers to bring class ‐action suits against defrauding corpora tions and was signed by nine lawyers whose clients include large companies and trade as sociations. Until recently, pro bono practitioners confined them selves to the representation of individual indigent clients in criminal and civil cases and to the test‐case approach of or ganizations such as the Ameri can Civil Liberties Union and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The new breed of pub lic interest lawyers provides legal services to a variety of citizen's groups which have just begun to demand access to the legal system and vindi cation of their legal rights. They are trying to give the same quality of representation that business interests custom arily receive to consumer or ganizations, conservationists, poor people and minority en trepreneurs. At its most imaginative, the practice of public‐interest law often intervenes in proceed ings which have never before been recognized as adversary, and helps create new constitu encies among people who stand to benefit from cam paigns for legal reform—for example; the consumers of a certain product. The public‐in terest advocate, in Ralph Na der's words, “seeks distribu tive justice for the greatest number of people, practices before all branches of govern ment and other large institu tions [such as corporations and labor unions], responds to his own conscience and dedi cation to professional goals. and remains undeterred and undetoured by parochial client interest or control.” Public‐interest lawyers in Washington are experimenting with a wide range of organiza tional structures. Among these are: Berlin, Roisman & Kess ler, a firm which handles pro bono matters exclusively and hopes to find enough paying clients to survive; Asher & Schneiderman, a firm 75 per cent of whose work is in the public‐interest field; the pro bono division of the large Washington law firm, Arnold & Porter, Benny L. Kass, a lawyer‐lobbyist who works on consumer problems for non profit groups and individuals; the Citizens Communications Center, a small, foundation financed office which special izes in representing citizens' groups before the Federal Communications Commission; the Urban Law Institute, an affiliate of George Washington University which provides rep resentation for Washington community groups; and the Washington Research Project, which focuses primarily on civil‐rights issues. One of the more interesting experiments is the Stern Com munity Law Firm, a founda tion‐backed group which is challenging the legal profes sion's own prohibition against soliciting business. (Director Monroe Freedman, who claims the ban is unconstitutional be cause it prevents public‐inter est lawyers from telling people about their rights, plans to advertise for clients.) Another is the Center for Law and So cial Policy, a foundation‐fund ed organization which trains students from universities such as Yale during part of their law school careers and recently helped win a court order requiring the Depart ment of Transportation to re open an investigation into cer tain G.M. pickup trucks. (Along with pro Bono counsel from Arnold & Porter, the center's lawyers argued that the department's engineers had found the truck wheels tend to develop cracks and collapse without warning.) “Banshaf is by no stretch of the imagi nation a radical. ‘A great deal can be done through the system by prodding it,’ he says.” ULTIMATELY, Banzhaf hopes that public funds will be forthcoming for a kind of or ganization of ombudsmen. “What I would like to do,” he muses, “is to continue with an organization having a prin cipal legal focus, and go into areas where I can find a con fluence of important problems and a point of legal leverage. The idea is to accomplish large result with a relatively small input. “It would be great to estab lish the proposition that there can and should be organiza tions whose purpose is to take legal or law‐related measures to benefit some aspect of the public interest, and that they should be supported at least in part by the public, either di rectly through contributions or by grants from other organ izations. This would also pro vide lawyers with an institu tional framework within which they can work professionally on a full‐time basis to advance what they see as the public interest. The success of such a venture would demonstrate that lawyers and law students can initiate legal action which can have an important cata lytic effect on society. The result would be a revolution within the system to avoid a revolution outside the system. Of course, I may be just a per petual optimist, but I think all this can be done.” “A saint he is not,” says a colleague about Banzhaf Banzhaf, who has also or ganized a lobbying arm of ASH called LASH (Legislative Action on Smoking and Health), claims credit for help ing to pass the law that will, beginning next year; ban all cigarette commercials from radio and television. (His im portance in the passage of the law was actually modest.) In characteristic fashion. moreover, he plans to keep the pressure on the cigarette companies. The deleterious ef fects of decades of cigarette commercials, he argues, will linger long after the new law comes into being on Jan. 2. Therefore, he plans to file a petition with the F.C.C. soon that would require stations to continue to provide free time for antismoking com mercials even after Jan. 2. His plans for the immedi ate future are vague, though he talks—like most pro bono lawyers these days about branching out into environ mental lawsuits. His next tar get may be the big oil com panies, whose TV ads some times make the claim that they are solving environmen tal problems. Such claims are “controversial,” just like cig arette commercials, Banzhaf says, and he plans to file a “fairness doctrine” complaint calling for the F.C.C. to re quire that free TV time be made available to challenge the oil‐companies”. assertions. THOUGH a legal activist, Banzhaf is by no stretch of the imagination a radical. He firmly favors working through established channels: “I be lieve there's a great deal that can be done through the sys tem by prodding it and oper ating on the periphery. I rec ognize many things that can't be achieved through legal ac tion. You can't sue to stop the Vietnam war or get student power. But I stay within the system because that's where I have my expertise.” Student reaction to Banz haf's action approach to the law has been generally favor able, especially among mod erates and even conserva tives. According to Aaron Handleman, a SOUP leader, “By the second year, law stu dents tend to get bored with classes. Professor Banzhaf triggers the urge to do some thing different and exciting.” Harry Stern, a participant in SNOOP, commented: “We learned what people can do if they really want something. It was a demonstration that second‐year law students can hold their own against law yers five years out of school.” Nader has termed Banzhaf “one of the most imaginative legal start‐up advocates in the country. He provokes his stu dents into creative applica tion of old bottles with new wines.” Commissioner Mary Gardiner Jones of the F.T.C. has said that “he has a philos ophy of how a citizen fits into the government and is doing concrete, positive things to make the government re spond. We surely need this kind of effort.” There are those, on the other hand, who accuse Banz haf of being abrasiVe, egotis tical, immature, opportunistic and politically inept. His fondness for publicity has ali enated some of his students. (“Talking to him about this problem is Me throwing water at a wall,” one of them com plained.) It is no secret at the law school that he is in tenure trouble. A not insubstantial number of his colleagues take an exceedingly dim view of him and his manner of opera tion. He is one of two mem bers of the faculty under 30 and is not given to treating his elders with deference. “A saint he is not,” was the suc cinct appraisal of one profes sor who is favorably disposed toward him. The faculty will decide this fall whether to grant him tenure. He could lose, and would have to leave. To a certain degree these problems derive from the fact that John Banzhaf has always been a loner, a fierce individ ualist who does not much care how people react to him. This quality has motivated and sustained him throughout his, career. It may also com promise his effectiveness. The survival of ASH, as well as that of all the public interest groups, depends in large part upon publicity. Pri vate contributors and founda tions are much more likely to support an operation which has enjoyed widely heralded successes. John Banzhaf has never taken a backward step in the competition for public attention. His critics contend that he overdoes it. For ex ample, law students in a group called GASP (Greater Washifigton Alliance to Stop Pollution), which took legal action against the overemis sion of exhaust from D.C. buses and which had no con nection with the Bandits, were very upset by what they saw as his attempts to take credit for their successes. STILL, it is not true, as some have charged, that he is motivated solely by a desire to see his name in print. On the evening after a minor police riot on the George Washington campus during a demonstration to protest the verdict in the “Chicago 7” trial, he went to the lockup and quietly bailed out several law students who had been arrested. And when the uni versity hospital refused to ad mit a 105‐pound law student who had been gratuitously clubbed by police, he brought the boy back to the hospital and invited officials to explain into his tape‐recorder exactly why they would not treat the injured student. They quickly changed their minds. Public‐interest advocacy can be a tricky business. At times it requires aggressive persist ence, a quality John Banzhaf has displayed in abundance. At other times, political acu men is indispensable. In this latter respect, his shortcom ings may run deeper than an apparent talent for rubbing people the wrong way. Pro bono advocates are re luctant to criticize others do ing similar work for fear of harming the movement. Yet some have privately admitted misgivings about Banzhaf's tactics, which have been termed unwise and even childish. Testifying at a Bu reau of Motor Carrier Safety hearing in July (dressed in what appeared to be a tennis outfit), Banzhaf warned that unless smoking were banned on interstate buses the pas sengers might resort to self help. To illustrate what they might do, he pulled a cylin drical tube which he said was a smoke bomb out of his pocket and challenged Isaac D. Benkin, the bureau's counsel, to give him a legal reason why he should not explode it on the spot. His argument was that if smokers had a right to pollute a bus, he could dis charge smoke in the hearing room. Benkin, visibly alarmed, threatened to report him to the bar association — where upon Banzhaf disclosed that the “bomb” was a harmless flare. At the conclusion of his re cent testimony in favor of a broad consumer class‐action bill before a Senate committee, exuberance lapsed into indis cretion when Banzhaf boasted: “Give us these kinds of tools, give me 500 law students in the District of Columbia, and I would turn the F.T.C. and the Justice Department and the major advertisers upside down and shake them.” Industry lobbyists opposing the bill are delighted to have such hyper bole on the record, and are expected to make good use of it in their efforts to help pass the Nixon Administration's watered‐down class‐action bill. There are skeptics who con sider the public‐interest law movement a fad and view Banzhaf as a shooting star who will soon fade from sight. They dismiss the students as dilettantes who are having a thoroughly enjoyable time in the pursuit of trivial causes. But the commitment of so many young people—with tal ent and training and experi ence—suggests that the move ment is here to stay. The fact that it has been able to ac commodate a quintessential individualist like Banzhaf tes tifies to its vitality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Women's Drive Grows in Europe,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/24/archives/womens-drive-grows-in-europe-womens-liberation-movement-gathers.html,"LONDON, Aug. 23—The rest lessly growing women's libera tion movement in Europe, which is attracting working class mothers and young radi cals, has stirred trade unions and governments in its drive for equal pay, equal jobs and equal rights. In Britain, Sweden and the Netherlands the movement has made sharp inroads over the last two years, reaching deep into the working‐class and poorer populations and provok ing debate and reaction in par liaments, schools and labor unions. Elsewhere, the move ment is fragmented but slowly forming. In Sweden, with the most advanced women's movement, the powerful, 1.6 million‐mem ber Swedish Trade Union Con federation has urged an end to “women's traditional orienta tion toward the home” as well as a “reappraisal of the typical role and functions of man and wife, of father and mother.” The union has strongly sup ‘ported the Government's re cently approved tax benefits for working mothers, revised educational programs’ that seek to blunt traditional sex roles—boys learn cooking while girls study shop mechanics—and ef forts to bring women into men's jobs and, what the union calls, “the controlling positions in politics, industry and corn merce.” In Britain, where the new Conservative Government has promised to strengthen worn en's position in divorce settle ments and is set to act on an antidiscrimination bill for pub lic facilities, trade unions are impatiently pressing for equal pay for women now. Recently, union leaders in the engineering industry demanding equal pay for 750,000 women workers’ threatened to tie up plants, around the country unless it was granted. In January, the Labor Govern ment, led by Mrs. Barbara Castle, the Minister for Employ ment and Productivity, intro duced legislation requiring equal pay for equal work by the ends of 1975. The bill has not yet been passed. “There's a restlessness about women here now,” a bespec tacled union leader and mother from Coventry, Audrey Wise, said at a recent meeting of Britain's 15 women's liberation groups. “Lots of people are try ing to evaluate their position in society and there's a general feeling of struggle in the air. Women are learning. The worm is turning.” Movement Stirs All Europe While the movement still ap pears shaky in such countries as West Germany, Italy and France—and while government al and union actions supporting women may be attributed more to social progress and aware ness among men than militant women's demonstrations—there appears little doubt that aware ness is growing throughout, Europe of women's drive for equal rights. The aims of the movement in Europe resemble the aims of militant women in the United States. But within the Socialist countries of Europe, and within the differing sexual and eco nomic and social mores of these countries, a pattern emerges that shows marked differences from the United States. Interviews with militant women in Britain, Sweden and the Netherlands and reports from New York Times corre spondents elsewhere in Europe indicate a far deeper drive to “liberate” men as well as wom en from their traditional roles as workers and competitors, enabling men to play an active, and more satisfying, role with in the family. While militant American women are seeking to release themselves from their jobs, and roles, with relative unconcern for the plight of men, numerous women's groups in Europe have focused more and more on free ing husbands from their roles, ‘too. The movement in Europe ‘appears to have reached more working‐class and poorer wom ‘en than in the United States. “We have appealed more to factory wives, working women, housewives,” said Leonora Lloyd, a women's liberation leader in Britain and editor of Socialist Woman. “In the United States there seems to be far more antagonism in the move ment toward men and the ap peal seems far more to the uni versity graduates and the mid die class.” Another women's liberation figure in Britain, Mrs. Selma Jones, an American who has lived here 15 years, said re cently: “Women's liberation in the United States takes as its impetus the black struggle. But it's middle class and they're only beginning to see working class women as exploited. “In Britain and most coun tries of Europe, you can't avoid class,” she said. “There's working‐class orientation to the movement in Europe.” Although the demands of militant women in Europe vary according to country, their aims are essentially the same. They seek to redefine the women's role, sharing the raising of fam ilies and housework with hus bands and ending the “domi nant” role of men in society. What Women Want Across Europe women are demanding tax benefits for working mothers, an increase in government‐supported nurs eries, changes in divorce laws, an end to “exploitation” in tele vision and radio advertisements depicting women in housewife roles and equal pay with men. In Britain, a man who is machine fitter in the electrical engineering industry receives base pay of $36 a week, while the woman at the next machine earns only $26. Women's rates in British industry range from 65 to 95 per cent of men's rates for the same job. For many women in Europe a key demand is equal oppor tunity in school, and an end to bias, especially in admissions to medical and apprentice schools. In Britain, women com prise only 24 per cent of the student bodies, compared with 42 per cent in the Soviet Union, 41 per cent in France and 37 per cent in the United States. Despite its sporadic growth, evidence of the women's libera tion movement in Europe is everywhere. Movement Formed in France In France, the feminist move ment now centers on Le Mouve ment Democratique Feminine, which seeks more day‐care cen ters, executive jobs and repre sentation in Parliament and especially the Government, where the present Cabinet in cludes only one woman, a state secretary. Spurred by activist women, legislation has been enacted in recent years that removes from men the right to make the sole decision on a place of residence and allows women to draw checks from the bank without a husband's permission. Kindergartens in Germany In West Germany, a small number of radical‐style kinder gartens have been set up in abandoned shops in Munich, Berlin, Hamburg and Cologne to enable women to work or at tend college. A woman's com mune has been formed in Munich, and nearly 1,000 sig natures were collected recently by women in Frankfurt urging abortion reform. In Italy, small women's liber ation groups have formed in Rome, Milan, Turin, Bologna and Genoa. Newspapers and magazines publishing stories on women's rights receive hun dreds of letters from women, especially in Sicily, where girls still go on dates accompanied by chaperones. At the moment Italy has no legal abortion reform and no divorce laws, although the Senate is to take up a divorce bill in the fall. Militant women in Norway are pressing the Government to force school doctors to teach girls over 14 years old how to use birth control devices. They are also demanding equal sal aries with men for equal work and the abolition of traditional alimony payments, contending that women are equally capable of making support payments. On one level, the women's liberation movement in Europe has drawn much attention re cently with demonstrations pointedly, but amusingly, aimed at redefining women's roles. “Making people laugh is the best way of waking people up to the absurdity of our posi tion in society,” said Corry Ehien, a 23‐year‐old leader of Amsterdam's Dolle Minas, or Mad Minas, a powerful women's liberation group named after Wilhelmina Drucker, a 19th century leader in the women's emancipation movement. The Dutch liberationists numbering 2,500 to 3,000 stu dents, housewives and workers, have sought to destroy the image of women as dependent and domestic figures by sitting on bicycles and whistling at men and marching into wom en's fashion magazines dressed as charwomen. In Denmark, feminists led by a writer, 28‐year‐old Ulla Dahl erup, have climbed onto buses paying only 80 per cent of the fare, dramatizing the wage dif ference between men and women in the unskilled labor market in Denmark. Confrontation Termed First Step To some women's liberation leaders, these confrontations are the first step in a social and economic revolution. “Well, here we all are then, millions of us, our situation demanding a fundamental redistribution of wealth, a profound transforma tion in the ways people relates to each other and an end to alienation,” said Sheila Row bothom, a British women's lib eration leader. “To communicate we have to find the symbols which express our oppression,” she said. “The symbol has to carry a whole complex of experiences within it,” she went on. “Thus women in the States located Miss America as a symbol; in Eng land we have located in a tac tical way the Ideal Home Ex hibition. “These express in a fragmen tary way some aspects of thingification, women as sex objects, as consumer dust bins, as rarefied art objects, the women as unreal unless she is being regarded by men.” The exhibition referred to is an an nual display of the latest de velopments in “modern living” for the home. Although feminist groups took militant action as far back as 1900, led in Britain by the suffragette Emmeline Pank hurst, the current liberation movement in Europe had two sources. Students Influence Movement One was the radical student movement, which seeks to revo lutionize the university and, by extension, governments and so ciety. Many of the women lib erationists in Europe, unlike the United States, are Marxist radi cals. A second element that spurred the women's liberation movement in Europe was the literature and publicity from the United States, especially Betty Freidan's book, “The Feminine Mystique,” a widely read and popular work published in 1963, that struck down the notion that woman can find fulfillment only through marriage and motherhood. Surprisingly, many women's liberation figures interviewed in Britain, Sweden, the Neith lands and other countries now view the movement in the United States as an aggressive, even violent, effort against men. “The groups in the United States seem too serious and far too angry,” said 25‐year‐old Sofie Lariviere, a psychol ogy student and a member of the women's liberation move ment in Amsterdam. Sweden represents, to some degree, a realistic ideal for women's liberation groups in Europe. The Swedish Labor Market Board has made strong efforts to bring women into “men's jobs.” The Swedish Air Force is now recruiting women pilots. More than 75 per cent of crane operators are now women and women are fre quently found as bus, subway and taxi drivers. More Women in Labor Force Within the last few years, the number of Government‐support ed day nurseries has doubled, with places for 35,000 children, allowing more mothers to enter the labor market. Tax laws have also been revised to allow more housewives to work. The labor force of three and one half million now includes 1.4 million women. However, Anna‐Greta Leijon, the secretary of the Swedish Labor Market Board, said dur ing a recent interview: “There are some illusions about Sweden that must be dis pelled because we are not quite as free or as progressive as we seem to be, and women still have a long way to go for equality. Our wages are still not equal.” “But we are progressive, suppose, compared to other countries,” she said. “We are quite small, only eight million. We are homogeneous.” In Britain, the drive for women's equality has been aimed at the 8.9 million women in the working force of 25.3 million. More than half of them earned less than five shillings, or 60 cents, an hour—a gross wage for a 40‐hour week of £10, or $24, according to Corinna Adam, a British women's liber lation leader. “It is a situation beside which middle‐class prob lems pale into near invisibility,” she said. There has been an uneasy division along class lines within the liberation movement in Britain, however: Some of the middle‐class university gradu ates view men as the cause of oppression; working‐class wom len and Socialists see the struggle rooted in society.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rockefeller Says Goodell ‘Has Problems’ on War,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/26/archives/rockefeller-says-goodell-has-problems-on-war-sees-voters-backing.html,"TICONDEROGA, N. Y., Aug. 25— Governor Rockefeller said today that Senator Charles E. Goodell faced a diffi cult election campaign because of his strong criticism of Presi dent Nixons conduct of the war in Vietnam. Referring to the man he named to the Senate two years ago next month, the Governor said in an interview that the Senator, his running mate, “looked very strong four or five months ago but now he has problems.” Mr. Rockefeller said that these problems could be at tributed to a general accep tance of President Nixon's ef forts to end the war. “Most people think the President has committed himself to end the war and they don't want peo ple shooting at him” the Gov ernor said. “I feel that's the majority view and that's my position,” the Governor said in an inter view as a helicopter carried him across the Adirondack Mountains from Malone, N.Y., to ceremonies celebrating the 150th avnniversary of the his toric fort here. Goodell ‘on Other End’ He added that Senator Goodell was “on the other end of the Vietnam war issue.” The Senator is co‐sponsor of a Sen ate resolution that would set specific timetable for with drawal of United States troops from Vietnam. Saying that Senator Goodell, was “a very able fellow,” Mr. Rockefeller said that he had “a feeling that he'll work his way out.” He indicated that he was putting his own money as well as finances of the Re publican State Committee be hind that optimism. The committee has pledged $250,000 to the Goodell cam Ipaign, but the Governor de clined to say how much he personally would contribute. “It will come out eventually,” he said, referring to post‐elec tion financial reports. The Governor's discussion of Senator Goodell with a report er was his only mention of his appointee during a day of cam paigning in the North Country, where the Republican Senator is unpopular among many or thodox Republicans. “I'm run ning for Governor,” Mr. Rock efeller said when asked why he did not mention Senator Goodell publicly. He pointedly ignored the Senator at a combined service clubs’ luncheon in Malone at though he painstakingly plugged the state ticket and a long list of local candidates, including Sheriff and County Clerk contenders. Among Buckley People Mr. Rockefeller was escorted ‘at the luncheon and a later visit to the Franklin County Fair at Malone by Hayward Plumadore, the chairman of the Franklin County Republican or ganization, which has en dorsed James L. Buckley, the Conservative candidate for the United States Senate. Mr. Plumadore said he and the Governor had not discussed the defection from Mr. Goodell. The county chairman added, with a smile, “I haven't been bawled out by the Governor.” The Governor was confronted with half a dozen “Rockefeller for Governor—Buckley for Sen ator” signs at an Oneida County Airport rally last night. The demonstration was organized by a Utica Republican ward leader, Dino Franco. Mr. Franco said he did not like Senator Goodell's “tactics toward the President.” Also waving Signs were dozen women opposed to the abortion bill that the Governor signed earlier this year. The women said they belonged to a Utica organization, American Society for the Protection of the Unborn. Mr. Rockefeller, in an allusion to the various placards, told a crowd of about 300: “We all like signs but we have to read them before we comment.” Mr. Rockefeller himself, de spite 12 years in office, appear ed today to be at least as popular and possibly more popular in this traditionally Re publican North Country that he has been in his last three guber natorial campaigns. The Governor was greeted warmly at an airport stop in Massena, the Malone luncheon, the fair and the ceremonies here. During a 90‐minute hand shaking tour of the fair at Malone, which included treks through earthy barns, the Gov ernor appeared as popular as ever among the voters. Only two persons showed any visible signs of hostility toward him. Four years ago, at the same fair, he was encountered sub stantial hostility because of his tax program. Several local poli ticians attributed the change to the Governor's more conserva tive stance on state issues, in‐I cluding economy. Goodell Discusses Backing Senator Goodell said yester day he believed that any Presi dential endorsement of his candidacy would be part of “general endorsement” of G.O.P. candidates by President Nixon. The Senator, at a news con ference at his East 45th Street office dealing primarily with other matters, had been asked if he had received an endorse ment from Mr. Nixon. He said, “I have no commitment from the White House.” Mr. Goodell, who was ap pointed to the Sena‐Le in 1968 to fill the unexpired part of the late Senator Robert F. Ken nedy's term, is in a three‐way race, against Democratic Rep resentative Richard L. Ottinger of Westchester County and Mr. Buckley. Polish Group for Governor The Pulaski Association of the New York City Police Department announced its “hearty” endorsement yester day of Governor Rockefeller and Lieut. Gov. Malcolm Wil son for re‐election. This is the first time that the group, con sisting of more than 1,600 members of Polish origin, has endorsed any candidate for public office.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Women Seeking Equality March on 5th Ave. Today,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/26/archives/women-seeking-equality-march-on-5th-ave-today.html,"With the city's blessing in the form of a proclamation designating today Equality for Women Day, the organizers of the Women's Strike for Equal ity exuberantly announced final plans yesterday for demonstra tions that they said would bring “thousands” to their parade down Fifth Avenue. The march is scheduled to start at 5:30 P.M. at 59th Street and Fifth Avenue, and to reach Bryant Park, behind the main branch of the New York Public Library, between 41st and 42d Streets, in time for a 7:30 P.M. rally. The parade and rally are ex pected to be the culmination of a long day of public actions —from “dialogues” to demon stration day‐care centers—be tween Wall Street and River side Drive. Similar demonstrations, taking forms as various as mock tea parties and mass rallies, are also scheduled in cities around the country, including Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles and Mi ami. Today is the 50th anniver sary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote, and it was chosen as an appropriate date to dramatize what the strike's organizers call “the un finished business” of women's equality. Demands for free abortion on request, a system of 24‐hour day‐care centers for the chil dren of working mothers and equality of educational and em ployment opportunity are the three central issues. The sponsoring coalition an nounced yesterday that it was calling on “women all over the country” to boycott four prod ucts whose advertising was termed “offensive and/or insult ing to women...[and] degrad ing to the image of women.” Comments by Advertisers The four products are Silva Thins, a brand of cigarettes pro duced by the American Tobacco Company, a subsidiary of Amer ican Brands; Ivory Liquid, a de tergent product of the Procter & Gamble Manufacturing Com pany; Pristeen, a “feminine hygiene deodorant” made by Warner‐Lambert Pharmaceutical Company, and Cosmopolitan, a magazine published by the Hearst Corporation. A spokesman for American Brands said his company had no comment on the allegations that commercials for Silva Thins “show women as an ob ject of male contempt and hos tility.” Procter & Gamble, a spokes man said, had replied to the coalition's letter objecting to the “frivolous and subservient image” of women projected, in the group's view, by Ivory Liquid advertising, saying that the company “would be inter ested in hearing what the ob jections were.” A spokesman for Warner, Lambert said: “Pristeen is for femininity, freshness and women's confidence. How can anyone be against that?” Mrs. Helen Gurley P. Brown, editor of Cosmopolitan, said that the magazine was “very pro women's lib” and that what the coalition apparently ob jected to was “the idea of women as sexual objects only.” “I think it's wonderful that a woman is sexually desirable, and I agree that it would be wrong to suggest that that's her only attraction,” Mrs. Brown said. A proclamation of Equality for Women Day is to be read outside City Hall today by depu ty Mayor Richard R. Aurelio. Mayor Lindsay will be in Port land, Ore., for a speech. A noon “dialogue” is scheduled to take place in City Hall park, at which it is hoped some city officials will be present to discuss issues with the women. A demonstra tion child‐care center will be set up in the park. The City Hall activity comes about halfway through the day's plans, which begin with the distribution of leaflets at sub way stations in the Wall Street area at 7:30 A.M. and include the placing of plaques in Duffy Square and the Grand. Army Plaza to designate the spots where the coalition feels statues of Susan B. Anthony and So journer Truth, a former slave who became a women's‐suffrage pioneer, should be placed. Leaflets entitled “You and Your Marriage” will be handed out to prospective brides at the marriage‐license bureau at 2 P.M.; the Social Security Build ing will be picketed at 2:45 P.M. to demand the extension of So cial Security coverage to house wives and divorced women, and a mock award will be given to the Katherine Gibbs School, a secretarial school, at 3 P.M. at 200 Park Avenue. Parade Is Major Event The parade that is expected to provide the major demonstra tion of women's solidarity will proceed down Fifth Avenue, but how much of the roadway it will be allowed to occupy was still unsettled last night. Bella Abzug, a Democratic candidate for Congress, said at the news conference that she had been assured that the marchers would be given all but one “emergency lane.” A Police Department spokesman said, however, that the matter was still under consideration. Senator Charles E. Goodell, who is seeking election to his first full Senate term in Novem ber, held’ a morning news con ference to state his support of the strike and his intention of introducing legislation to imple ment the three principal de mands. The Republican Senator, who was wearing the dark‐red and white strike button with a representation of a closed fist inside the biological symbol for woman on his lapel, was all but endorsed by Betty Friedan, the originator of the strike and the founder of the National Organization for Women. The Senator said that he had to be in Washington today but would have marched in the Fifth Avenue parade if it had been possible. In Albany, Governor Rocke feller yesterday proclaimed to day Women's Rights Day in the state, saying that it was “in the best interest of our whole so ciety that the crusade for equality and justice for women continue and ultimately pre vail.” The strike, according to Mrs. Friedan, is operating on a budg et of “under $10,000,” not all of which has yet been raised. A fund‐raising “victory celebra tion” will be held at 9 P.M. to night at the Village Gate night club.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Community Dispute Cuts Service at City Hospital,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/26/archives/community-dispute-cuts-service-at-city-hospital-dispute-cripples.html,"Lincoln Hospital in the South Bronx said yesterday that was terminating its obstetrical and gynecological services be cause 24 of 28 physicians in the department had walked off their posts in a dispute involv ing community groups. The doctors acted in support of Dr. J. J. Smith, the head of the department, who has been criticized by three black and Puerto Rican groups that have been demanding better patient care and working conditions in the hospital. Dr. Smith was “fired by the people” on Monday, according to Pablo (Yoruba) Guzman, minister of information for the Young Lords, a Puerto Rican group. He said they had acted against Dr. Smith “because of his genocidal abortion pro gram” and his attemps to “fire a black physician on his staff.” Dr. Smith was unavailable for comment. And Dr. Antero Lacot, the executive adminis trator of the municipal hospital, said comments on Dr. Smith's position at this time “are the responsibility of the Albert Ein stein College of Medicine.” Einstein is affiliated with Lin coln and assigns medical per sonnel to the hospital. A spokesman for Albert Ein stein College of Medicine issued the following statement: “The Young Lords have ejected the director of obstet rics and gynecology of Lincoln Hospital and have refused him permission to work. We cannot work if we are not allowed to do so.” Dr. Lacot said that patients were being referred from his hospital to Morrisania and Ja cobi Hospitals, both also in the Bronx. He said 15 to 20 patients were transferred yesterday. At an afternoon press con ference in the hospital's chapel, members of the Young Lords, the Think Lincoln Committee and the Health Revolutionary Unity Movement—all private community groups — charged that 27, not 24, doctors in the obstetrics ‐gynocology depart ment, which has 73 beds, had “walked off” in‐support of Dr. Smith. A spokesman for the New York Health and Hospital Cor poration said reports of threats to Dr. Smith were under in vestigation. The three community groups denied that any threats had been made. “We just told Dr. Smith to leave and not come back,” said Cleo Silvers, a representative of the Health Revolutionary Unity Movement. The three community groups said that only two doctors were left to attend patients. One, they said, is Dr. Noel Phillips, who was discharged by Dr. Smith on Monday but was reinstated later Mr. Guzman of the Young Lords said the doctors were not able to care for the patients in the hospital and announced plans to “bring vans to move people to other hospitals in the area as soon as possible.” Dr. Lacot said any efforts to remove patients from the hos pital would be resisted. “I cannot allow anyone to interfere with the running of this hospital,” he said. A nurse refused to let un authorized persons into the obstetrical ward, saying “a state of semi‐emergency [exists] since not enough people are covering the floor.” She was not wearing a name tag and re fused to identify herself. Another nurse, who also would not give her name, said that nurses planned to stay out in support of the doctors today. Downstairs in the waiting room, Francisco Santos of 900 Fox Street pleaded with hos pital officials to help his wife, who, he said, had just had a miscarriage at three months into her pregnancy. “She's been bleeding and bleeding, and I've been here seven times and they keep telling me to take her home, that she needs rest,” he told a reporter who overheard his conversation. Mr. Santos said his wife had not been hospitalized “but is. out there lying on two chairs I pushed together for her.” Miss Silvers said that when the doctors left Lincoln Hospi tal they went to Jacobi Hos pital, which is affiliated with Einstein College. She said that her group had “begged them to come back this evening.” Since July, when members of the three groups occupied the hospital for more than 12 hours before they left under threat of arrest, they have been in the hospital, helping to register patients, running a day‐care center that they established and monitoring patient care in general. Lincoln Hospital, which serves more than 300,000 South Bronx residents, about 80 per cent of whom are Puerto Rican and 20 per cent black has long been the scene of protest activities by community groups. In February, South Bronx civic leaders who serve on the hospital's community advisory board staged a sit‐in in the administrator's office to press their demand to have Dr. Lacot, a Puerto Rican, appointed‐to the post he now holds. Joseph V. Terenzio, then the city's Hospitals Commissioner, opposed the appointment, say ing that Dr. Lacot was not qualified. “The issue is not whether Puerto Rican will be appointed to the post,” he said. “The issue is community control. They want to dictate who will be the assistant commissioner in charge of the hospital.” In March, after Mr. Teren zio's resignation had been an nounced, the Lindsay adminis tration said that Dr. Lacot would be given the post at Lincoln. Several months later the Young Lords; a militant Puerto Rican group who describe them selves as socialist and model themselves after the Black Panthers, began making de mands on the 350‐bed hospital, along with the two other com munity groups. Among the —demonstrators’ demands were no cutback in services or jobs, quick comple tion of a new Lincoln Hospital, door‐to‐door preventive medical care emphasizing tests ‘for lead poisoning, anemia, tuberculosis and drug addiction, and a day care center. A focal point of the protest has been the death of Mrs. Carmen Rodriguez, who died in the hospital on July 19, four days after receiving an abortion under the new state law that went into effect July 1. While the hospital said that a heart ailment was a “con tributing cause” of death, the protesters laid the blame on inadequate facilities in general and on Dr. Smith in particular.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Enlisted Woman, 23, Sues Navy Over Sexual Rights",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/26/archives/enlisted-woman-23-sues-navy-over-sexual-rights.html,"ATLANTA, Aug. 25—An un married Navy enlisted woman whose stillborn child was fathered by an enlisted sailor has filed suit against the United States Navy. She charges that its subsequent decision to dis miss her from service because of terminated pregnancy was based on a double sexual stand ard and was therefore, a viola tion of her constitutional rights. Seaman Anna Flores, a 23‐year‐old Mexican‐American sta tioned at Pensacola, Fla., con tends in a plea filed yesterday in Federal District Court there that men in the armed services are not subjected to the same moral restrictions as women, and that such a distinction is discriminatory. She argued that if men are not discharged for having extra marital or premarital sexual re lations, then neither should she. Her suit could become highly significant because she asked the court to ban all military regulations based on sex. Moreover, the litigation will probably proceed at a time of increasing national attention to the status of women, spurred by the “women's liberation movement,” the drive to liber alize abortion statutes, and pro posed legislation in Congress that would outlaw discrimina tion based on sex. ‘Class Action’ Suit Miss Flores's attorney, Charles Morgan Jr. of the American Civil Liberties Un ion, has fashioned her com plaint into a “class action” in which she seeks to represent all other women serving in the armed forces. But her primary objective seems not to become either champion or a martyr but rather to reverse the decision to dismiss her one year before her enlistment expires. That decision was made Ini tially at Whiting Field, a naval air station near Pensacola, by her commanding officer, who recommended that she be dis missed. “To do otherwise would im ply that unwed pregnancy is condoned and would eventually result in a dilution of the moral standards set for women in the Navy,” the recommendation stated. Miss Flores, a native of Dal las, asked Senator John G. Tower, Republican of Texas, to intercede. After inquiries were made by Senator Tower, the final decision on her mili tary status was postponed. In her letter to the Senator, she asked: “Who in the world is guilt less? Who is free of error?. Am I the only person in naval un form ever to have made a mis take?” Her petition to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida states that, although pregnancy is an official basis for discharge from the Navy, regardless'of woman's marital status, numer ous Navy men have intercourse with women to whom they are not married, father children out of wedlock, contract venereal disease but are not dismissed from the service. The suit, citing her “com manding officer's recommenda tion for dismissal, concludes that Navy men are not subjected to “the moral stand ard set for women in the Navy.” Plans for Marriage The petition states that Miss Flores enlisted in the Navytwo years ago at Fort Worth and after her assignment to Whiting Field began dating an enlisted man. They became engaged to be married, and she became pregnant, the suit states. The couple set May 28, 1970, as their wedding date. On May 27, she entered the base dispensary and on May29, she miscarried, it is stated. While recovering, she was informed orally that she was to be dis charged because of her termi nated preganancy. A month later, the memoran dum recommending her dis charge was forwarded to Washington. Miss Flores and her fiant6 are still dating, she says, and intend to be married. Her personnel records indi cate that her superiors were pleased with her discharge of her duties throughout her ‐two years in service. She maid tained a “secret” security classification and is described in one memorandum as a wom an who “will become an excel= lent supervisor as she gains more experience.” In her letter to Senator Tout er, Miss Flores said she was proud to be in the service of her country and of “the right to wear my uniform,” adding that her dismissal had come as “a cruel shock.” Her suit names as defend, ants, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Navy, her commanding officer and several other figures in the military chain of command. The Navy has not yet re sponded in court to the petiz tion. Its personnel would make no comment on it, either in Pensacola or in Washington:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
City Gets Injunction in Lincoln Hospital Dispute,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/27/archives/city-gets-injunction-in-lincoln-hospital-dispute.html,"State Supreme Court Justice Arnold G. Fraiman signed !restraining order at 11 o'clock ;last night barring community ‘I groups from ‘'interfering with (patient care and medical serv ices” at Lincoln Hospital. Most of those on the hospital obstertrics and gynecology staff refused for the second day in a row to report for work, con tending that the community groups who unilaterally set up offices there earlier this year had intimidated the staff. The injunction, answerable Monday at 10 A.M. was sought by the city's Health and Hospi tal Corporation in an attempt to ;assure the boycotting staff that !there would be no harassment or intimidation by the com munity groups. A spokesman for the corpo ration said last night that ef forts would be made today to serve copies of the restraining order on the radical groups at their headquarters and that “if any member of these groups steps inside the doors of Lin coln, they will be served with the order. We will move swiftly against anyone who violates this injunction.” Twenty‐four of the depart ment's 28 physicians walked ;off the job Tuesday after the ;department head, Dr. Joseph J. !Smith, reported that he had been intimidated and harassed by the community groups. Seventeen nurses—most of the department's nursing staff—joined the physicians yesterday as a major part of the 43‐year‐old hospital's service slowed to near a halt. Dr. Smith's ouster was de manded by three groups—the !Young Lords, the Think Lincoln Committee and the Health Revolutionary Unity Movement —following the death July 19 of Mrs. Carmen Rodriguez after an ‘abortion at the hospital. According to Dr. Antero Locat, the executive administra tor of the city hospital, the community groups had been permitted limited use of the hospital to set up informational tables and a day‐care center for the children wandering near the long lines of mothers who visit clinics each day. But the groups exceeded “ground rules” that were set, Dr. Locat said, and the injunction was needed. The administrator, who drew praise yesterday from some members of the community groups, said that the informa tional table and day‐care cen ter would still be permitted but that “unauthorized” use of of fices and other parts of the hos pital would not. Some Haiiway Debates The rest of the hospital's 70 !member staff of physicians was reported functioning normally !yesterday, although hallway de bates over the controversy were a regular occurrence. The hospital's medical board, an ad visory group headed by 15 senior staff members, expressed support for the obstetrics staff. contending that staff members have been in fear of the com munity interlopers and that patient care had been disrupted. The Community Advisory Board, a group of IS laymen officially recognized by the hospital, met. late in the day as a score of police were on duty and television cameramen. moved through the halls taking pictures. Monserrate Flores president of the advisory hoard, said after the meeting that “a vote; of confidence” in Dr. Smith and his staff had been approved. The staff was not unanimous ly opposed to the community, critics. Members of the pedi atrics department said the I groups had brought attention; to severe shortcomings that have been long neglected by administrators. Pediatrics mem bers said they would attempt to meet with city hospital of ficials this afternoon. Return of Staff Expected Dr. Joseph T. English, presi dent of the city's Health and Hospital Corporation, said that once the injunction was in ef fect, he expected the missing physicians and nurses would re turn in line with assurances he had received from officials of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, which provides medi cal staff under a contract with the city. For more than 15 years, new 1,000‐bed hospital has been promised by the city to replace the present 350‐bed structure, which is on East 141st Street, in the shadow and roar of the Bruckner Ex pressway traffic. Groundbreak ing occurred earlier this month. but Dr. English estimated the new institution was four years off. Dr. Smith could not be reached for an interview.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For Most Women, ‘Strike’ Day Was Just a Topic of Conversation",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/27/archives/for-most-women-strike-day-was-just-a-topic-of-conversation.html,"For the vast majority of women, yesterday was a day simply to go about one's business—whether that meant going to a job, attend ing a Broadway matinee, having one's hair done or washing the baby's diapers. However, although few women actually went on strike, women's liberation was the main topic of con versation among men as well as women throughout the city. Predictably, the reac tion to the strike was mixed. “Sure, there's been a lot of talk—mostly in jest,” said Bill Monk, whose beauty sa lon at 1921 Church Avenue, Brooklyn, was filled with customers. “We have a mid dle‐class clientele and their liberation is being able to come here and spend three hours having their hair set.” In business offices, the strike formed the basis for a great deal of casual hu mor and in some cases seri ous, though informal, meet ings. “I told my boss I had thought of bringing my chil dren in and having them sit on his lap,” said Doris Wil lens, public relations direc tor for Doyle Dane Bernbach, the advertising agency. “But the children refused.” The general manager of the agency, Dorothy Parisi, spent the day in what Mrs. Willens thought was the most liberated way possible. She took off to play golf. Meanwhile, women in at least two offices held lunch hour “rap sessions” to dis cuss equal employment, day care and other issues. At Random House, the publish ing concern, about 80 wo men, one‐third of the staff, joined in such a meeting, while several hundred at tended one at the office of the National Council of Churches, 475 Riverside Drive. In at least one large com pany, the Equitable Life As surance Society, the reaction to the “strike” was largely negative. “The movement is regarded with some ridicule here,” said a spokesman for the company, which has 4,650 women employes. “The con sensus among our women is that they agree with the equal pay demand, but not with free abortions or day care.” “I'm against the whole equality thing,” nodded 18‐year‐old Rosalie Kronick of North Bergen, N. J., a typist at the Equitable offices at 1285 Avenue of the Amer icas, at West 51st Street. “I'm afraid of being drafted.” Of all the city's industries, radio appeared to be among the most affected by today's activities. Station WNEW AM devoted its entire sched ule to records by female vocalists and interviews with leaders of the feminist move ment. Station WBAB in Babylon, L. I., went even further, turn ing over the entire station to women employes for the day. With women acting as disk jockeys, news broadcasters and directors, only two men were present—the program director and an engineer. The station has no female engi neers. In Manhasset, L. I., three young women took over the studios of WTHE, a country and‐Western music station, for two hours, during which they made comments on fem inism and played music for the occasion. The Columbia Broadcasting System reported that few women took advantage of a memo issued Monday author izing them to take the day off if they wished, either as part of their vacation or without pay. For some who did strike, it was a difficult decision. “I personally have a pretty good job and am treated well,” said Jain Kelly, a young in surance company employe who participated in several events yesterday. “But final ly I said to myself, ‘this is more important.’ I told my boss, he said ‘fine,’ sneered, and walked away.” Mrs. Maureen O'Callahan Davies, a Glen Cove, L. I., housewife and mother, ex plained that she was boy cotting housework because although she felt it was “a fulfilling opportunity” she did not believe “it should be forced on all women.” Supermarkets, self‐service laundries and Broadway thea ters were crowded yesterday. “We're busy squeezing to matoes like we do every day, unfortunately,” said Mrs. Carolyn Malfa, who was shopping with her three young daughters in a Ma maroneck, N. Y., supermar ket. Of suburban women she said, “No one's looking to. make waves. As much as they scream about hubby coming in at 9 instead of 6,. they wouldn't seek to change their way of life.” “Women's liberation?” echoed Mrs. Barbara Sullivan as she folded her 15‐month old daughter's diapers in self ‐service laundry on Church Avenue in Brooklyn. “Never thought much about it, really.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Women March Down Fifth in Equality Drive,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/27/archives/women-march-down-fifth-in-equality-drive-women-march-down-fifth.html,"Celebrating the 50th anni versary of American women's right to vote—and the start of a new crusade for equality —a crowd of more than 10,000 people, mostly women of all ages, occupations and viewpoints, marched down Fifth Avenue to an enthusi astic rally in Bryant Park last night. The rally, which began about 8 P.M. in semidarkness and ended an hour later, was the high point of a day of demonstrations in New York and around’ the country that Mrs. Betty Friedan, originator of the notion of yesterday's “Women's Strike for Equal ity” and founder of the Na tional Organization for Wom en, called “beyond our wild est dreams.” The 10,000 people that the police estimated were at the rally—a figure disputed by its organizers—applauded all the speakers but gave Mrs. Frie dan the loudest cheers and applause. “This is not a bedroom war, this is a political movement,” Mrs. Friedan said. “Man is not the enemy, man is a fel low‐victim.” Another speaker was Kate Millett, the author, who told the crowd: “Today is the be ginning of a new movement. Today is the end of millen niums of oppression.” Mrs. Eleanor Holmes Nor ton, chairman of the city's Commission on Human Rights, called for Senate passage of the Equal Rights Amendment. “Give us the right to com pete,” she said. “Give us the right to live, the right to a job regardless of sex.” The rally was generally un disturbed by hecklers, and the crowd dispersed shortly after 9 P.M., some 200 of them go ing to a fund‐raising “victory celebration” at the Village Gate, a nightclub in Green wich Village. The other speakers includ ed Mrs. Bella Abzug, a Demo cratic Congressional candidate, and a black speaker from the Third Women's Alliance who expressed skepticism about the movement, saying that “revolu tion and not reform is the answer.” Although the Police Depart ment had officially given the, marchers the use of only one lane of Fifth Avenue, they over flowed the barricades almost immediately, causing a continu ing traffic tie‐up in the blocked cross‐streets that filled the air with blaring horns. One woman was arrested for disorderly con duct. The march was augmented as it moved, slowly because of the traffic ahead, and the marchers called, “Come join us, sisters,” to women on the sidewalks. The marchers included both suffragettes who were veterans of the movement to win the right to vote that ended vic toriously with the ratificaion of the 19th Amendment Aug. 26, 1920, and leaders of the new movement, such as Mrs. Friedan. Men March, Too The majority were women, but there was a group of men carrying a banner reading, “Men for Women's Rights,” and sprinkling of marchers whose causes seemed unconnected with the parade's purpose, in cluding a group carrying Viet cong flags. Other groups included those calling for “Free Abortion on Demand — Women's Liberation Supporters of the Socialist Workers Party Candidates,” the Emma Goldman Brigade, NOW, the New York Feminists, les bian groups and some whose placards gave no immediate clue to any ideology, such as “I Love You, Susan B. An thony,” and “Liberte, Egalite, Sororite.” One of the marchers was Mrs. Elsie K. Belmont, 79 years old, who said: “I marched when I was 16. They used to call us suffrage‐cats. It always does my heart good to see a few people thinking—thinking.” The women ranged in age from a group that called them selves “H.S. Women Unite” and seemed of high‐school age ‘to Older Women's Liberation, and their occupations included sec retaries, housewives, lawyers and typists. Three who marched together were a grandmother, a mother and her daughter, Mrs. lonella Church,.70, her daughter, Mrs. Veronica Bock, 48, and her daughter, Mrs. Veronica Caruso, 23. There were indications of hostility from the spectators, who were predominantly male. At 45th Street’ one man ap peared wearing a brassiere; op posite St. Patrick's Cathedral, at 50th Street, there were jeers of “bra‐less traitors!” Day Gets Recognition The day, conceived as Wom en's Strike for Equality, was given official recognition at the local, state and national level, with Mayor Lindsay, Governor Rockefeller and President Nixon all issuing proclamations en dorsing its significance. In New York, as elsewhere in the country, the impact of the day of demonstrations be yond those already involved or interested in the women's lib eration movement appeared to be minimal. Mrs. Friedan said repeatedly that she was not disheartened: “The whole thing to me is just so tremendously moving that it isn't simply a numbers game,” she said at the City Hall rally. “I palpably feel that women's consciousness is changing and it's irrelevant to me whether 500 or 5,000 wom en turn out. This is already huge success because the wom en's movement is going to be the biggest movement for so cial and political change in the nineteen‐seventies.” The city's businesses report ed no unusual absenteeism, and the retail stores also noted no adverse effect on business. In other large cities, the bus iness communities indicated the same lack of absenteeism. But most large cities, and sev eral smaller ones, did have demonstration. About 5,000 women gathered on Boston Common for a rally and 1,000 went on to march through downtown Boston. The groups represented included contingent dressed in academic gowns carrying a banner point ing out that “Veritas is a Fem inine Noun.” “Veritas,” the Lat in word for truth, is the mot to of Harvard University. A noon rally drew 2,000 people in San Francisco's Union Square. In Miami, women staged a “mock coffee‐cup breaking garden party.” About 125 women marched on City Hall in Syracuse, N. Y., and in Manhasset, L. I., women gathered signatures on a peti tion urging Senate passage of the Equal Rights Amendment. Leaflets were distributed in Denver, and Philadelphia's Rit tenhouse Square was the site of a demonstration that includ ed karate exhibitions. In Seattle about 150 women participated in an open house in the May or's office. Los Angeles marked the day with several demonstrations—including two by women's groups opposing the women's liberation movement—a motor cade, and an evening rally. About 1,000 people, most of them men, gathered for a noon rally in Center Square in Balti more, and a 13‐hour conference on women's rights was held under the sponsorship of a coa lition of women's groups in Pittsburgh. Marches and rallies were staged in Washington, where much of the emphasis was placed on lobbying for Senate passage of the Equal Rights Amendment. Although the march and ral ly were, as planned, the cli mactic events of the day in New York, there were activi ties scattered around the city all day long. Some of them that included the following: 10 A.M.—A dozen women showed up for a ceremony to “consecrate” a site at Duffy Square on Broadway from 46th to 47th Street, for a statue of Susan B. Anthony, the “mother of the movement.” The ceremony was presided over by Ms. Mary Orovan, dressed in cassock and surplice as a “symbolic priest.” As she made the sign of the cross, she intoned: “In the name of the Mother, the Daughter and the Holy Granddaughter. Ah‐wo men. Ah‐women.” “Ms.” is used by women who object to the distinction be tween “Miss” and “Mrs.” to de note marital status. NOON—In City Hall Park, about 35 children played, napped and ate on the grass under the care of their mothers in an area designated as “demonstration day‐care cen ter,” the need for which was the central issue of the rally planned for the park. The num ber of police—male and fe male—around City Hall indi cated that a large, and aggres sive, turnout was expected. One woman, Lucy Komisar, a vice president of NOW, at tempted to enter the day‐care area without the necessary spe cial identification. Miss Ko miser, dressed in a white‐and purple flowered pants suit, was stopped by a policewoman and escorted away, under protest. The matter was adjudicated by Barry.H. Gotteherer, an assist ant to the Mayor, and Miss Komisar was released. “She's a lady, let her go,” said the policeman who was with Miss Komisar. By 12:30, a crowd of 1,500 people — as many, if not more, men than women, and an ap parent mixture of the already converted and the lunch‐hour curious — had gathered to hear the speakers who battled with erratic sound equipment. Some of the crowd carried placards, such as one reading: “Repent, Male Chauvinists, Your World is Corning to an End” and “Don't Cook Dinner Tonight—Starve a Rat Today.” The speakers included Gloria Steinem, the writer and femin ist; Mrs. Bess Meyerson qrant, the city's Commisioner of Con sumer Affairs; Mrs. Norton, Mrs. Abzug and Mrs. Friedan. Deputy Mayor Richard A. Aurelio read the Mayor's procla mation of Equality for Women Day. Mrs. Abzug, whose vigorous tones overcame the lapses in the sound system, drew the most enthusiastic response from the crowd with her finger jabbing calls for the implemen tation of the strike's three prin cipal demands—free abortion on demand, the establishment of community‐controlled, 24 hour day‐care centers for the children of working mothers, and equality of educational and employment opportunity—“... and we mean to have it now!” Mrs. Norton stressed that her mandate to prevent job dis crimination “is an empty man date unless the women have place to leave their children.” Until after 2 P.M., small groups of spectators, almost all men, lingered to engage in “dia logues” with women of the movement. “Women seeking this kind of equality are really seeking to free men,” said a woman who refused to give her name but said she was “almost 50” and had grown children. “To en slave men,” murmured one of her male listeners. At the Interchurch Center, 475 Riverside Drive, an “ad hoc women's group” sponsored noon meeting attended by about 150 persons, mostly women. Miss Theressa Hoover, asso ciate general secretary of the board of missions of the United Methodist Church, said that the winning of equal rights for women would be a “bulldozing process that will have to go on for the rest of our lives.” 2 P.M.—The second‐floor of fice of Thomas Lenane, the Acting City Clerk, was invaded by about 20 women, who pre sented Mr. Lenane with pamphlet, “You and Your Mar riage,” that they suggested he distribute with marriage li censes. The pamphlet, prepared in paste‐up form by the Marriage and Family Committee of the National Organization for Wom en, was a 19‐page series of explanations of the law as it applies to marriage. One of the group, Mrs. Mavra. DeRise, 28, of the Canarsie section in Brooklyn, said she was not against marriage. The purpose of the pamphlet, she said, was to “warn people about what they're getting into.” 2:35 P.M.—The same group arrived at the Federal Building, 26 Federal.Plaza, to find the revolving doors locked and the guards adamant. Later, about 2:45 P.M., Mrs. Betty Berry, a coordinator of the Marriage and Family Com mittee who had arrived earlier and been allowed in to meet Joseph Kelly, regional commis sioner for the Social Security Administration, held a short formal dialogue. The group's demands—for the extension of benefits to divorced women and to housewives—were read to Mr. Kelly. He said they would be forwarded to Wash ington. 3 P.M.—Sixty women jam med into the reception area of the Katherine Gibbs School, on the third floor of the Pan Am building at 200 Park Ave nue, to confront Alan L. Baker, president of the secretarial school, with their charges that the school was “fortifying” and “exploiting” a system that kept women in subservient roles in business. Mr. Baker said he ‘would “take a good look” at the question. About 10 members of NOW, starting at 9 A.M. and contin uing on into the afternoon, vis ited six firms, business and ad vertising agencies, to present mocking awards for allegedly degrading images of women and for underemploying wo men. A group of women visited The New York Times and dis cussed equal‐rights issues. An article on how women in the public eye regard women's equality appears on Page 39.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Liberated Woman,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/27/archives/the-liberated-woman.html,"It is an unfortunate truth that a protest group such AS the Women's Liberation Movement can only make itself heard if it speaks at the top of its voice and resorts to publicity‐seeking exhibitionism. The suffra gettes of a half‐century ago, whose great triumph—the nineteenth amendment—was commemorated yes terday, were often noisy and obstreperous. Their suc cessors of today go on strike, march down Fifth Ave nne and “liberate” the Statue of Liberty. But the attention‐getting antics do not detract from the sub Stance of the demand for full equality put forward by modern women. There has been a revolution in the status of women and it is still going on. The Women's Liberation Movement is more its progeny than its ‘progenitor. This revolution is, in large measure, a product of sci ence and wealth. Because Western societies are in creasingly rich, they can afford to educate more of their women and provide them with leisure. Because Science has eliminated most of the drudgery, if not the tedium, of farm work and household work, mil lions of women are free to leave the fields and the kitchens and work beside men in offices and factories. Once such a revolution in education and work took place—and it has been going forward with accelerat ing momentum in the United States and Western Europe for more than a century—it became logically impossible for men to sustain the pretension that masculine dominance was inherently natural or neces sary. The spread of birth control devices have virtu ally completed this revolution by freeing women from the risk of unwanted pregnancies, the risk which heretofore has always hobbled women seeking the freedom men enjoy. Now all that remains is for laws and popular atti tude to catch up with the new facts of equality. The three main planks in the platform of the Women's Liberation Movement are unexceptionable. This news paper has for many years advocated drastically liber alized abortion laws. Additional child care centers are clearly desirable to assist mothers who work. There is no good reason why universities and professional organizations continue to discourage qualified women from entering certain professions or block their ad vancement if they do. There could well be thousands of‐additional women in engineering, architecture, med icine and other traditionally masculine professions. With regard to the equal rights amendment to the Constitution, we continue to believe that the House Of Representatives was opportunistic rather than thoughtful in whooping through this proposal a few Weeks ago. Sound as is the measure's goal, it is up to the Senate to explore the implications of the amend rnent's broad language and make certain that it does not inadvertently weaken the protection of working women or the property rights of wives. This is a mat ter for careful legislating, not for emotionalism political gestures. The vanguard women who write the books and lead the protests of the current movement are not necessarily going to be the models of the women of the future any more than most women of fifty years ago adopted the militancy of Susan B. Anthony or Carrie Chapman Catt. But old concepts like “illegiti macy” and the “double standard” will gradually dis apPear. Those women who have no taste for marriage or childbearing will feel less constrained by society to adopt roles which are uncongenial. But many values will remain little altered. The family has proved to be a tough, durable human in stitution in many different social settings. Many women will continue to find their most satisfying fulfillment in bearing children and raising them. Like other revolutions in human history, the revolution the status of women will change much and will leave much else unchanged.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DOCTORS STAY OUT AT HOSPITAL HERE,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/28/archives/doctors-stay-out-at-hospital-here-injunction-fails-to-influence-27.html,"Despite a court order served on radical groups at Lincoln Hospital yesterday, the 27 doc tors who are boycotting the hospital because of alleged in timidation by the radicals re fused to return to their jobs. After a late afternoon con ference with hospital officials, Dr. Joseph J. Smith, head of the hospital's department of obstetrics and gynecology and a key figure in the dispute, asserted that he and the other boycotting doctors would only consider returning when the atmosphere is conducive for proper professional patient care.” When asked to explain what he meant by a conducive atmosphere, Dr. Smith motioned toward the street outside, where militants had gathered and had begun to entreat hospital work ers to join them in “demands” for changes in hospital condi tions, including establishment of a community‐worker board to operate the city hospital. “It's obvious,” the physician said. “Just look out the window. You'll see Young Lords all over the place. Certainly this kind of air, or tension....” He did not complete the sen tence, and left almost immedi ately, after announcing the hos pital's obstetrics section was closed. The 27 doctors involved in the boycott—all but two of those assigned to the depart ment—walked off the job Tues day after Dr. Smith charged he had been held prisoner by a militant group and then threat ened with bodily harm if he re turned to the hospital. Late Wednesday night, State Supreme Court Justice Arnold G. Fraiman signed a restraining order barring the Young Lords and other militant groups from “interfering with patient care and medical services” at the facility. The restraining order was served on the militants yester day when half a dozen showed up at the hospital in the morn ing. The militants had previous ly been permitted by the hos pital to set up information tables and a children's day‐care facility. But the hospital has said that the groups exceeded “ground rules” and that the in junction was needed. The Lords, a militant Puerto Rican group, contend Dr. Smith was “fired by the people.” They say negligence by the South Bronx hospital, which is situated in a heavily Puerto Rican area, caused the death of an abortion patient. While the 27 doctors re mained out. 17 nurses who had joined the boycott on Wednes day returned to their duties yesterday, Dr. Antero Lacot, administrator of the hospital, announced. The nurses made up most of the department's staff. Dr. Lacot said there were “very few” obstetric patients left yesterday at Lincoln, the rest having been transferred to other hospitals. Three physi clans who accompanied Dr. Smith to see the hospital ad ministrator yesterday stopped in to see several new mater nity cases that had arrived at the institution. Sympathy for Militants Late yesterday more than 15 young resident physicians from Lincoln Hospital who said they sympathized with many of the demands of the Young Lords appeared at the offices of Dr. Joseph T. English, president of the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation, 125 Worth Street. When an aide of Dr. English informed them that the hos pitals chief would not meet with them, but would be willing to meet with them next week if they arranged an appointment through Dr. Lacot, the group said Dr. Lacot did not represent them. They said conditions at the hospital were deteriorating and that the community con trol was badly needed to re store public confidence in they hospital. The hospital's corporation, through a spokesman, noted yesterday that a $3‐million re novation program had recently been completed at Lincoln and that the 350‐bed institution, which has a rundown appear ance, is scheduled to be replaced by a 900‐bed institution, at 149th Street and Morris Avenue, the Bronx, in two and a half to three years. The hospital was heavily guarded by police yesterday as Dr. Smith and his group left, without incident. Cleo Silvers, chairman of the Health Revolu tionary Unity Movement, one of the militant groups vowed to return daily to the street in front of the hospital's entrance, at 320 Concord Avenue, until all militant demands were met. Confirming that Dr. Smith had advised him the boycotters would not return until “the whole situation comes back to normal,” Dr. Lacot expressed the hope this would take only “a short time.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Besieged Hospital Head,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/28/archives/besieged-hospital-head-antero-lacot.html,"If it were not for militants among the people of the South Bronx, Dr. Antero La cot might not be administra tor of Lincoln Hospital. He had been turned down for the post by the then Hos pital Commissioner, Joseph Terenzio, and it was not until Puerto Rican commu nity leaders in the area applied strong pressure to the city that Dr. Lacot got the job. Now, ironi cally, it is militants of the same community who are giving Dr. Lacot his biggest problems as they demand more and more control over what goes on in Lincoln Hos pital. Man in the News Yesterday, about two dozen staff physicians con tinued their refusal to work at Lincoln even though a group of young militant Puerto Ricans who had been in the hospital for weeks left under a court order. In July, members of the Young Lords occupied a part of the hospital, demanding improved care for Puerto Ri can patients, day‐care facili ties for children of patients and workers and other con cessions. Dr. Lacot permitted them to stay in the hospital, where they served as inter preters and heard complaints from patients and workers. Then, earlier this week, the Young Lords announced that the “people” had dismissed the hospital's head of obstet rics because of his “genocidal abortion program.” After 24 of the department's 28 physi cians walked off the job, Dr. Lacot got an injunction bar ring the militants from inter fering with hospital activities at Lincoln. Training for Job Antero Lacot prepared for his present post in a variety of related jobs. He graduated from the University of Michi gan's medical school in 1944 and also holds degrees in pharmacy from the Univer sity of Puerto Rico and in ad ministrative medicine from Columbia University. He came to New York four years ago after practicing medicine and holding admin istrative positions in Puerto Rico for 22 years. He served as chief of obstetrics and gynecology for the hospitals in the Fajardo district of east ern Puerto Rico and later was administrator of one of the hospitals in Fajardo. Since coming here, be has served as director of the Neighborhood Maternity Clin ic on Prospect Avenue in the Bronx, a satellite of Lincoln Hospital, and on the faculty of Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva Univer sity. He is an assistant pro fessor of gynecology and ob stetrics at Einstein. He also has been an assistant profes sor in the department of pre ventive medicine and com munity health. Dr. Lacot, who also served in the Army Medical Corps from 1953 to 1955, has had enough government and ad ministrative experience to be wary of officials pronounce ments and promises. Thus, when he spoke at the ground breaking ceremony Aug. 5 for a new Lincoln Hospital, first announced by the city 15 years ago, his voice was tinged with skepticism. “I cannot help thinking,” he told the gathering, “of how many times ceremonies of this sort are followed by long, agonizing periods of in activity. I feel deeply con cerned about the pace that future activities here will take.” The new hospital is sched uled to rise by the spring of 1974 on a nine‐acre site bounded by Park and Morris Avenues and 144th and 149th Streets, next to the Mott Haven yards of the Penn Cen tral Railroad. It will have 950 beds. The present structure, declared obsolete in 1949, has 350 beds. Dr. Lacot was born 50 years ago in Arroyo, P. R., into a middle‐class family he describes as “professionally oriented.” His father is a certified public accountant, His brother is a lawyer, one sister is a pharmacist and an other sister is deputy com missioner of education in Puerto Rico. Dr. Lacot owns a home in the upper‐middle‐class Col lege Point section of Queens. He lives there with his wife, Rosalina, and his three children — twin 12‐year‐old son, Antero and Jose Miguel, and a daughter, Rosalina, 17. The boys both will attend Eastern Military Academy in Cold Springs, L. I., next month. Rosalina attends St. Agnes High School in College Point.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
City Aide Meets Boycotting Doctors,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/29/archives/city-aide-meets-boycotting-doctors.html,"Dr. Joseph T. English, presi dent of the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation, met yes terday with representatives of 27 physicians who are boycott ing Lincoln Hospital in a dis pute with radical community groups. A spokesman for Dr. English said later that the hospitals chief expressed “very high opti mism” that the Bronx hospital's obstetrics and gynecology de‐, partment, which has been shut down by the boycott, would re open this weekend. The spokesman said that six of the boycotting physicians had ;attended the two‐hour meeting at the hospital late yesterday. They were reported to have ar ranged a meeting last night with the remaining boycotting doc tors at another location to dis cuss “several formulas” that were said to have been worked out for resolving the impasse. The details of the formulas were not disclosed. Press for Better Care The 27 doctors, all members of the obstetrics‐gynecology unit, walked off the job on Tuesday, after the head of the department, Dr. Joseph J. Smith, charged that a band of militants had held him prisoner on Monday and had threatened him with bodily harm if he returned to the hospital. The militants, which include the Young Lords party, the Health Revolutionary Unity Movement and the Think Lin coin Conichittee, have been pressing for expanded and im proved medical care at the hospital. They also want ad ministration of the institution to be placed in the hands of “community‐workers board.” The radicals contend that Dr. Smith was “fired by the people.” They demanded his ouster after the death on July 19 of Mrs. Carmen Rodriguez, following an abortion in the, hospital. Interference Is Barred The militants, who had been running a children's day ‐care center inside the hospital for the last six weeks, with the hospital's consent, continued for a second day to remain out side the institution yesterday in accordance with the terms of a State Supreme Court re straining order signed Wednes day. The order barred the groups from trespassing or in terfering with patient care or medical services. The order, sought by the city, is answer able in court next Monday at 10 A.M. It was the presence of the radicals across the street from the hospital entrance, at 320 Concord Avenue in the South Bronx that led Dr. Smith on Thursday to assert that the doctors would return only when “the atmosphere is con ducive for proper professional patient care.” 3 Psychiatrists Quit Meanwhile, a spokesman at the Harlem Hospital Center con firmed yesterday that there had been II resignations among members of that hospital's psy chiatric department. But he de nied that the action was con nected with a “live‐in” that has been under way at the hos pital since July 25 by an anti drug group, the United Harlem Drug Fighters. The resignations occurred over the last three months, the spokesman said. Three psychi atrists were among those who resigned. Those who resigned did so to accept better jobs or for various other reasons not related to the drug‐group sit uation, the spokesman said. Dr. Smith did not attend yes terday's Lincoln Hospital meet ing with Dr. English, hospital officials said. Among those present was Dr. Antcro Lacot, administrator of the Hospital. which is in a heavily Puerto Rican area, and Dr. Labe c. Scheinberg, director of the Al bert Einstein Medical College,of Yeshiva University. Einstein provides medical services it Lincoln, under a contract with the city. 20 Policemen Patrol Both Dr. English through his spokesman, and Dr. Lacot, at a. news conference in his office, said yesterday that they believe the atmosphere at the hospital was free of harassment and in timidation. Both expressed the hope that the doctors would de cide to return soon. The hospital was being pa trolled by approximately 20 policemen, stationed outside and inside. Pablo Guzman, minister of in formation for the Young LordS,. said, “If those 27 doctors want to come back and take care of the needs of the people of South Bronx, all power to them.” Asked if that included Dr. Smith, he said that Dr. Smith “doesn't want to come back.” Post Office Stamps Stolen ?? SUFFERN, N.Y., Aug. 28—Burglars took all of the stamps in the Suffern Post Office sometime before 3:30 A.M. to iday. Postal authorities withheld the value of the stamps stolen.

"Women on the March, Page 4",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/30/archives/it-was-a-great-day-for-women-on-the-march.html,"She stood in front of a flap ping orange banner that said “Women Unite,” and she smiled. Then Kate Millett, author of “Sexual Politics” and one of the Chief theoreticians of the wom en's liberation movement, began to speak to the 10,000 people who had gathered in New York's Bryant Park last Wednesday for a rally following a women's march down Fifth Avenue. “You're beautiful; I love you,” she told the crowd. “At last we have a movement.” With those words, the 36‐year‐old feminist pretty much summed up the feelings of the women's coalition that had scheduled the Women Strike for Equality on the 50th anniversary of the amendment that gave women the vote. From its beginnings, the movement was widely regarded, especially by men, as somebody's idea of a bad joke. “A Lesbian plot,” muttered some. “A group of frustrated old maids who need a good man,” said others. In some circles, the liberation ists were viewed as Pucci‐clad women from Seven Sisters col leges who were outraged be cause they weren't editing Time and Newsweek. The march helped refute those stereotypes. Every kind of wom an you ever see in New York was there: limping octogenarians, bra less teenagers, Black Panther women, telephone operators, waitresses, Westchester matrons, fashion models, Puerto Rican fac tory workers, nurses in uniform. young mothers carrying babies on their backs. They were marching because, they wanted equality with men —and, they said, because they wanted men to think of them as human beings, not just sex objects. Leaders Surprised In private, the strike leaders conceded that they were as tonished by the turnout for the march. (Estimates ranged as high as 50,000 people). They also expressed surprise at the fact, that so many black women had marched—the movement had always been thought of as con centrating on the middle‐class, college‐educated white woman—and that almost one of every 10 marchers was a man. “The whole thing was beyond our wildest dreams,” commented Betty Friedan, the strike’ co, ordinator, who sparked the move ment back in 1963 with her book, “The Feminine Mystique.” Another fact that became clear Wednesday was that the move ment was not confined to the po litically liberal Eastern Seaboard. Although the Manhattan march was the most impressive action of all, there were also smaller marches and demonstrations in about 40 cities, including Wash ington, Chicago, Detroit, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Mi ami, Kansas City and Durango, Colo. The “Lesbian plot” notion ap peared to have been refuted when a member of the Radical Lesbians made a plaintive plea at the Bryant Park rally for support from her, “straight” sisters in the movement. The speaker charged that the police were harassing Lesbians, and that other women in the movement were ignoring their plight. “We're your sisters, and we need help!” the speaker cried. As the strike leaders see it, the day's major accomplishments were that it showed women that the “sisterhood” is powerful, and that it got many people who had never done so before to talking about the movement and the three demands of the strike: free abortion on demand, free 24‐hour child‐care centers and equal op portunity in jobs and education. One sign of the movement's strength is that opposition groups have sprung up, including MOM (Men Our Masters) and the Pussy cat League; Inc., whose slogan is “Purr, Baby, Purr.” But most of the criticism Comes, from men, as did most of the heckling in Wednesday's parade. At 45th Street, one man ap peared wearing a brassiere. “If you don't wear one, I will,” he shouted at some of the bra‐less marchers. Other men threw pen nies at the marchers, and carried placards reading “Draft Women Now” and “Back to the Kitchen.” Much of this hostility appears to be inspired by the movement's radical members, many of them self‐proclaimed man‐haters who decry the “myth of the vaginal orgasm” and refuse to cooperate with men in any walk of life. Many of the nonradical wo men, including most of the mem bers of the National Organization for Women (NOW), the move ment's largest group, ignore these “crazies,” as they often call them, and concentrate on “gut” issues, such as equal pay for equal jobs. (Bureau of Labor Sta tistics figures show wage dis crimination against women at all levels from professional to ser vice ones.) Major Weakness One major weakness of the movement is that opposition to it also comes from women. These range from wives who are con tent to stay home with their children, and who view the move ment as “unfeminine,” to suc cessful career women who be lieve that the protesters either aren't trying hard enough—or have limited abilities to begin with. (A recent Gallup poll showed that 65 per cent of Amer ican women believe that women get as good a break in this cotin try as men.) What will the movement take on next? Most feminists say it will be the Equal Rights Amend ment, which passed the House on Aug. 10 after being bottled up in committees for 47 years. If the Senate doesn't pass it, or the states take an unusually long time to ratify it, the odds are good that the women will take to the streets again. —JUDY KLEMESRUD",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Isla Vista War—Campus Violence In a Class By Itself,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/30/archives/the-isla-vista-war-campus-violence-in-a-class-by-itself-the-isla.html,"ISLA VISTA, Calif. AFTER a tense but relatively quiet summer, this youth ghetto next to the University of California at Santa Barbara is stirring with life again. The students, all of them deeply tanned and most of them driving expensive cars sig nifying their parents’ affluence, are streaming back to prepare for the fall quarter. As they unload their suit cases and surfboards, there are a few shouts or squeals of pleasure as old friends are recognized. But most of the young men and woman are grim faced and nervous. The vacation has not diminished the fear which gripped this community from January through June of this year. In public statements, university of ficials say they are “apprehensive” about the autumn term, which begins in a few weeks. That word is absurd ly mild as a description of their true emotions. In a private and candid mo ment, one U.C.S.B. administrator ad mitted, “We're scared—scared to our bones—about what might happen in the next few months.” Another offi cial speaks of “frustration and dis couragement,” then says flatly. “This university may not survive.” The memory of six months of con vulsive violence is still sharp and painful. Many students feel that their choice now is only between anger and despair, and many remain stunned by the year's violence and horrors. Several individuals I talked with struggled for a sane perspective and temporary solace by recalling the rare scenes of brittle comedy in the Isla Vista war. One young man, in a letter to his parents, wrote, “If you make the mistake of taking things too seriously you're lost, for the situation is far too senseless to permit any rational attempts to deal with it. What ‘you are left with is a kind of unpleasant study in black humor.” The humor is more ironic than black: In the midst of one Isla Vista riot, a philosophy professor saw a sweet‐faced girl hurl a rock toward a sheriff's deputy. The professor carefully placed his glasses in his coat pocket, pulled her by the ear to a nearby bench and methodically spanked her a dozen times. During another volatile moment, two police cars raced into one corner of Isla Vista in response to a report that another patrol car was under siege by rock throwers. A roving band of anarchists pelted the two cars with a volley of jelly beans. One policeman, grotesquely but efficiently garbed in flak vest; plastic face‐covering and helmet, put aside his unloaded rifle after a five‐minute barrage of rocks. He pulled a sling shot from his back pocket, fired a large pebble at the demonstrators, then gleefully shouted, “I got one! I got one!” A 17‐year‐old boy was asked why he had thrown a Molotov cock tail through a store window. He shrugged, then answered with mock melodrama, “Because it was THERE.” A dignified, elderly woman who had flown in from London after her son was jailed, joined a peaceful but illegal sit‐in at Isla Vista's Perfect Park. As a policeman herded her toward a paddy wagon, she pro tested, “But, officer, I do not wish to be arrested.” The dean of students, white haired and rational, tried earnestly to establish a dialogue with several students during one crisis. They re sponded by silently surrounding him and blowing marijuana smoke into his face for 10 minutes. N0, it's not funny, from the per spective of an outsider. But the people who suffered through the re cent months of violence and bru tality, of fire and blood, can be excused the grim chuckles. To them, it all seemed like a surrealistic night mare. “And the hell of it is that it's not over,” one girl says with fright in her eyes. “It just goes on and on and on.” The Isla Vista battles did not repre sent just a widening generation gap and political polarization. This is so cial fragmentation, a complete disin tegration of all the systems of thought and order which have usually worked through the nation's history. Isla Vista, an unincorporated half square mile jammed with student dwellings just west of the campus, is not simply the scene of another “stu dent disorder.” The prolonged vio lence and brutality here make it an extreme case study for the Presi dent's Commission on Campus Un rest. This was — and is — a compacted civil war: In February, the Bank of Amer ica's Isla Vista branch was burned to the ground after several hours of confused skirmishing by anar chists and police. Loss: About $400,000 in measurable dam age. Add the immeasurable so cial cost of increased antago nism by a California public al ready deeply antagonistic to ward “those spoiled brats” and fearful about the growing threat to traditional concepts of property rights. In April, Kevin Moran—a 22‐year‐old economics major and a moderate who was seeking to cool radical vio lence—was shot and killed as he stood in front of the new, temporary bank building. The bullet came from the rifle of Santa Barbara police officer David Gosselin, who had won an “Outstanding Policeman Award” for 1969 and was a member of a well‐trained anti sniper squad. (“Accidental,” ruled a local coroner's jury after examining a defective safety catch on Gosselin's rifle.) In June, police officers went on a rampage, kicking down apartment doors, drag ging individuals out of bed rooms and bathrooms, and profanely threatening many of the arrested. Rioters and bystanders, radicals and moderates, students and adult residents were indis criminately gassed, menaced with shotguns and clubbed. A local attorney concludes that this breakdown of prop er law enforcement was worse than at the 1968 Chi cago convention, at‐which he had been present. Columnist William F. Buckley, after correspondence with some of his conservative friends in Isla Vista, concedes “what would certainly seem to be utterly senseless examples of repression.” The statistics of the Isla Vista battles to date include, in addition to the one stu dent's death, 30 persons seri ously injured (students by shotgun blasts or clubs; po licemen by rocks), 400 less seriously vounded, and sev eral thousand tear‐gassed. Almost 1,000 people were arrested, most in June, and about 70 felony charges have been filed. The mone tary loss is in the millions, from property damage, law enforcement costs and (Lis runted university and local business operations. There were indirect dam ages, unmeasurable but pro found. The Isla Vista riots, along with the episodic vio lence on most of the other eight campuses in the Univer sity of California system, have thoroughly repelled a majority of the state's voters and legis lators. They are obviously in a mood for reprisal against the university as a whole. In a June election, voters defeated a $246‐million bond issue for expansion of the university's crowded medical schools. The mere words “University of California” on the ballot, in the current public mood, would probably doom a mod est subsidy to cure cancer. In a blatantly vengeful at titude, the State Legislature recently excluded university faculty members from a gen eral salary increase for all state employes — excluding even the university's nonaca demic staff. One Assemblyman offered this astonishing expla nation for the Legislature's vote: “We're not trying to punish the university's faculty for all the trouble; we're just trying‐to discipline them.” THE university's nine cam puses are caught now in an impossible financial squeeze: While new services are de manded by a growing student population and pressure rises for radical changes toward academic “relevance,” a con servative state government is cutting back on the univer sity budget. Worst of all, some of the university's chancellors and other ad ministrators are nearly de moralized. During the past year—and for the first time in six years of campus tur moil—a wedge of doubt about the university's actual survival has cut into the traditionally rational attitudes of hope by the state's top educators. Sev eral of the chancellors, includ ing veteran Roger Heyns at the Berkeley campus, have re cently been placed in the ludi crous position of denying re ports (one of which was re portedly submitted to Presi dent Nixon) that “the Univer sity of California is dead.” The ugly moods are deeper now, by far, than those I have sensed on other campuses during or just after student riots, including Ber keley and San Francisco State College. A crew‐cut member of the football team, self‐described as “a conserva tive who always respected law officers,” now calls po lice “the pigs” and plans to pack a gun on his return to school. A delicately beau tiful Oriental girl who works in a local coffeehouse re members her recent, firm ad vocacy of nonviolence and now says, “Not any more, not any more.” A high uni versity administrator gazes out the window toward the ocean and says numbly, “Maybe we've had it, as a functioning university and as a free society.” An articulate, admitted anarchist smiles smugly at the new structure rising at the site of the burned bank and says to a friend, “There's a whole lot of wood in the new one.” A thoughtful eco nomics professor notes that the new hero for most stu dents—someone whose “head is together”—is one who is ready to commit a revolu tionary act resulting in a 15‐year jail term. An intelligent, soft ‐spoken Santa Barbara man precisely and confident ly outlines his plan to get 30 of his middle‐aged friends together and “string up the first longhair we see to the nearest eucalyptus tree, at the first hint of trouble.” The jarring irony is that such ugliness pervades an area of such extraordinary beauty. The city of Santa Barbara, 12 miles east of the campus and Isla Vista, nestles in sunny comfort between the rugged. Santa Ynez moun tains and the Pacific Ocean. Fragrances of tropical blos scms mix with the subtle smells of the sea. There's a spotlessly white, solid quality to the buildings, most of them of Spanish design, and most of the 146,000 people who live in them are wealthy, relaxed and free of the frantic freeway temperament of Los Angeles to the south. The University of Califor nia campus up the coast seems idyllic. The buildings, all of tastefully imaginative design, are separated by great spaces landscaped with lawns, exotic plants and many trees—olive and acacia, palm and pine. Careful planning is evident in the bike paths and walkways which meander toward a lagoon and a fine beach at the eastern border. It's the fastest growing branch in the nine‐campus university sys tem. Isla Vista itself is some thing else. It's a mess; what one university vice chancellor and planner calls an “archi tectural abortion.” At first glance, it seems pleasant enough, like one of the more affluent Southern California suburbs of two‐story apart ment buildings inhabited by young, groovy, single profes sionals. Most of the buildings in which about 9,000 of the university's 14,000 students live have depressingly phony facades. They are monoto nously uniform in size and shape, but boast such names as “The Colonial” (eight Cor inthian columns with peeling paint), “The Tahitian” (a sin gle palm tree), and “The House of Lords” (a minuscule patch of shingles beneath each window). One of the few apartment buildings which delivers more than promised is “The Olive Tree,” which has two of that species in front. Most of the apartments are cheap and shoddy —walls of thin sheetrock and appliances which break down so often the normally difficult landlord tenant relationship generally verges on hysteria. Students complain bitterly about the poor facilities, high rents (not really out of line with similar dwellings else where) and the absence of sidewalks and other commu nity conveniences. But most of them are fond of the place and many of them feel a pecul iar sense of community. The basic reason is the freedom they enjoy here. The univer sity has no authority over Isla Vista; its lots are pri vately owned and developed. There is no supervision in the residences, none of the rules and restrictions which apply to the few thousand students (mostly freshmen) who do live in on‐campus dormitories. Many Isla Vista residents be come eloquent about “being able to run our own lives here, to, be adult.” It is also openly acknowledged that there is another basic appeal in the unrestricted, free life of Isla Vista; students them selves call it “Sin City.” IT is a ghetto. It has one of the highest population densi ties of any spot in California. In addition to the 9,000 stu dent residents, about 3,000 nonstudents live here; but most of them are young and many are even more antago nistically estranged from so ciety than the students. (There's been a big influx of “street people” and wandering hippies since Isla Vista emerged as a new battle ground for the youth revolt.) The ghetto designation is appropriate for other reasons. Governmental services are meager; more than 30 juris dictions have some authority in Isla Vista, none of ‘them have prime responsibility for the place; many officials wish that it would quietly sink into the sea. The din of music and voices in Isla Vista undoubt edly matches any inner‐city ghetto. An estimated 400 of the residents are on hard drugs; the students themselves are deeply concerned about the growing use of heroin. Prob ably 90 per cent of Isla Vista's residents have tried mari juana, and about half of the students here use it with some frequency. Even in normal times, sheriff's deputies patrol Isla Vista constantly, and they definitely do not look the other way from pot smoking. The most moderate, straight students live in fear of get ting busted while in the pres ence of marijuana smoking. Several issues brought things to a head this year. In Jan uary, several hundred stu dents staged a demonstration on Santa Barbara's wharf on the first anniversary of the 1969 blowout of an offshore oil well. (Local beaches are still blemished with ugly globs of oil and tar, and at least one well is still leaking de spite all the rhetoric from Sacramento and Washington.) Many of the oil‐leak demon strators moved immediately to an on‐campus protest related to a fight between Dr. Wil liam Allen, an anthropology teacher, and university admin istrators and academic lead ers, who had not renewed his contract. (More than half the student body signed petitions demanding an open hearing for the bearded, hip profes the administration re fused. One student says, “Bill Allen is the only professor around who carried on the kind of dialogue with students everybody is yelling for.” An administrator says with sharp disdain, “Of course he's popu lar. He had 1,300 students and he gave 1,250 A's.”) Demon strations for—and sometimes led by—Dr. Allen continued sporadically through the last week of January and the first few weeks of February, most in front of the university's administration building. The new conventional, al most ritualized escalation of violence developed “like a Greek tragedy,” as one sad professor put it. University officials stood in front of the demonstrators, trying to speak with reasoned phrases in con ciliatory tones. Radical stu dents chanted back with ob scenities. By Berkeley stand ards, the action in January and early February was tame: several windows were broken, a few people were injured, area police and sheriff's depu ties were called in and 20 students were arrested. The war then was waged more with leaflets than force. “There was a lull for a while in February,” remem bers one student. “There was an ugly mood running swiftly beneath the strained quiet. Sometime in February—I don't know exactly why or when—tolerance evaporated.” The pressures on the cam pus and in Isla Vista intensi fied. Passions were aroused by typical forces: radical in vective in the student news paper, El Gaucho; plotting by hard‐core, nihilistic anarchists, estimated to number about 100 leaders and another 200 or 300 followers. Frustrations deepened over the usual is sues: the war, the draft, the hypocrisy of the Establish ment, the arbitrary imperson ality of authority, the aca demic irrelevance of the big, bureaucratic university. Extra aggravations were abundant: Gov. Ronald Reagan outdoing Spiro Agnew with denuncia tions of the “spoiled brats” on the campuses; a speech on campus in which William Kunstler, the Chicago Seven's attorney, urged, in essence, that the students “free” Isla Vista from the greedy, capi talistic, blankety‐blank “sys tem.” AS always, the strictly per sonal, individual irritations of life were accumulating be neath all the lofty, identifiable “issues.” One student remem bers and candidly describes a prime reason for his angry mood in late February: “I was so goddamned mad at my landlord I could spit; the re frigerator in my apartment wouldn't work and he wouldn't fix it.” Another young man, after a coherent and rational recitation of all the issues and causes which had frustrated him in February, sheepishly added another “reason” for his rock‐throwing mood: “My chick was bitchy and cold then so I suppose I was sex ually frustrated.” The volatile mixture of a hundred causes and frustra tions exploded on the night of Feb. 25. After the rally at which Kunstler spoke, several hundred students gathered in Isla Vista's Perfect Park, at the bottom of the U‐shaped “loop” area of the community's small businesses and realty offices and next to the Bank of Amer ica. Rocks shattered the real ty‐office windows, fires were set in innumerable trash bins, meager forces of police and sheriff's deputies hesitantly moved in and out of the scene, and firemen, apparently in hibited by threats from anar chists and the caution of po  Speaking of guerrilla tactics —both sides used them lice, held to the periphery of the action. Near midnight and after re peated attempts, anarchists ignited the bank with flam ing trash bins. Some of those in the mob cheered. Many others who had crowd ed in or near the battle stood ‐.‐quietly as the roar and light of the flames filled the night. “I was stunned that it was actually happening finally,” remembers one student of semiradical views. “How do you explain it?” says Don J. Poulson, the bank's manager for seven years. “You don't. It's just crazy, that's all it is.” Poul son, a white‐haired, friendly man in his 50's, looks pained and disconsolate when he re members that February night. “I felt like a ship was being lost in a storm and I was the captain of it.” On the other side, a talka tive anarchist rambles for half an hour about the “reasons” for burning the bank, most of them having something to do with the nature of revolution and the symbolism of cap italistic institutions. Then, im patient with his own abstract words, he blurts out simply, “Hell, man, the bank was burned because it was just the biggest’ and most imposing ouilding around.” The February, violence sub sided as the county and the campus declared states of emergency, a thousand Na tional Guardsmen occupied Isla Vista and rain fell steadi ly through the weekend after the bank burning. But van dalism and controversy con tinued and the tensions of the campus and the Isla Vista ghetto persisted. On April 3, the university refused to al low Jerry Rubin, the Chicago Seven's Yippie, to speak on campus. The wrath of many was aroused by disciplinary or civil action against a few score students and teachers involved in the February vio lence. A war‐moratorium rally on April 15 set off additional but contained disorder. The next day, 2,000 students at tended an on‐campus rally from which Rubin had been prohibited; most of them flocked to Isla Vista's loop area later in response to ru mors that Rubin would appear in disguise or would speak from a landing craft off the Isla Vista beach. That night, and the next, about 400 an‐, archists and radicais roved through the community, set ting small fires, threatening the new, temporary prefab ricated bank structure and erecting street barricades. Sheriff's forces and police from Santa Barbara and other nearby communities moved in somewhat more decisively, several times clearing the demonstrators and anarchists with sweeps of tear gas and bursts of shotguns, which wounded at least four stu dents with birdshot. But a new and unprece dented dimension to the war developed on the nights of April 16 and 17. “Moderate” students—fed up with both anarchist turmoil and police tactics—moved in with an at tempt at self‐policing. For sev eral hours on both nights, law enforcement personnel gener ally stayed out of sight as moderate students battled an archists. In the compacted student civil war, fires were set by radicals and then ex tinguished by moderates; bar ricades were erected by radi cals and removed by moder ates; the bank was attacked by radicals and defended by moderates repeatedly. At times, radicals and moderates engaged in verbal warfare, screaming at each other with a blend of rational argument, historical citations and four letter words. More often, fists flew and violence erupted as the two, youthful, disorgan ized forces battled in unstruc tured guerrilla warfare. SOON after midnight, April 18, authorities decided that the moderates’ self‐policing effort wasn't working or win ning;_ police and sheriff's forces were ordered in. At 1:15 A.M., moderate Kevin Moran stood in front of the bank after helping to ex tinguish a blaze inside started by a Molotov cocktail. His hands were in the air—some thought he was seeking by word and gesture to calm the crowd, other witnesses fig ured he had seen police piling out of trucks and was protect ing himself with the gesture of peaceful cooperation. The bullet ripped into his side at the waist. He screamed, “Oh, my God, I'm shot,” and died. Moran's death shocked Isla Vista and the campus. “A lot of us had thought—even with all the rage and violence—that this whole thing was a sort of silly game,” one girl says. “But, Jesus Christ, when Kevin was killed we knew the whole thing was real.” For three days, sheriff's officers spoke so firmly about student sniper fire that one national wire service flatly reported that Moran had been killed by a sniper's gun. But on April 20, Sheriff James W. Webster disclosed that Officer Gosse lin's rifle had discharged at the instant Moran was killed. (He and other police authori ties had known it since a few hours after Moran's death.) Gosseliri testified at a spe cial coroner's inquest: “I [pointed] my weapon [a.30 06 caliber rifle] at the sub jects.... I was wearing gloves, because it was cold. I had my rifle in the ‘ready’ position... with my right finger between the trigger and the trigger guard. The weapon did discharge. At the time... I couldn't believe it. I was consciously sure the weapon had fired... but subconsciously I didn't want to believe it.... I had never consciously taken the safety off and don't believe I would subconsciously do it.” In Sacramento, Governor Reagan said that “it didn't matter where the bullet came from,” that it was “started on its way” long before by the first “campus agitators.” A few days earlier, Reagan defended at a press confer ence his recent statement on campus violence in which he said, “If it takes a bloodbath, let's get it over with. No more appeasement.” It had been just a figure of speech, the Governor said, but then he added that “a great many people have been slapping me on the back. They don't think it was a wrong figure of speech at all.” A few weeks later: Cambo dia was invaded; President Nixon, in the Pentagon, re ferred to campus “bums""; four young students at Kent State were shot to death. Yet in Isla Vista and on the uni versity campus, there ap peared a few encouraging signs, at least to university authorities and local police. “There was a fine, earnest di alogue going,” one adminis trator remembers. “After all the horrors, people seemed to be rational again. There were many well‐attended meetings to discuss the issues. The kids were even chatting amiably and curiously with the few cops who were still around. The moderates won all the student elections over the radicals and even took over the school newspaper. We all thought that things had got ten back to normal.” On May 29, UCSB Chancel lor Vernon I. Cheadle permit ted Jerry Rubin to speak in the campus stadium; he said that he felt the campus and Isla Vista atmosphere was “cooler” than in April when he had denied permission for Ru bin to speak. Most of the stu dents who heard Rubin's speech were bored. They wan dered away from his clown ishly revolutionary rhetoric to study for final examinations or to enjoy the late spring sun and surf on Isla Vista's beach. Then on June 3, the Santa Barbara County grand jury voted felony indictments against 17 youths on charges relating to the February bank burning. District At torney David Minier now acknowledges that the “tim ing of the indictments was a blunder—we should have waited until after the school term when everybody would have left.” Even moderate students felt no particular love for the Bank of Amer ica, had been irritated by a bank advertisement offering a $25,000 reward for informa tion leading to convictions and assumed that the in dictments represented “poli tical reprisal and persecu tion” against several campus activists. Within a day, the indignation was transformed into fury for many when it was learned that two of the 17 indicted for the bank burning had absolute alibis. They had already been in jail at the time of the in cident. Embarrassed officials dismissed charges against the two men. But it was too late. De spite the idyllic spring weath er and the imminence of final examinations, Isla Vista ex ploded again. Window‐smash ing and incidents of arson spread through the ghetto as anarchists roved through the loop area around the bank's temporary structure. The civil war was on again, with moderate students and teach ers seeking to halt the vio lence and destruction. This third major battle of the Isla Vista war raged for a full week, and all of the fragmented forces involved in the conflict were better or ganized than in the February and April battles. Anarchists retreated by day to plan and plot each night's violence. The moderates met each day to appoint leaders and pin point more sophisticated de fensive techniques. Law‐en forcement agencies deployed droves of informers and ob servers throughout Isla Vista. Faculty and local clergymen organized teams of observ ers to note and keep meticu lous records of the conduct of the anarchists and the police. County officials de clared an early state of emergency and invoked a cur few, and the sheriff's office alerted police forces as far north as San Luis Obispo (80 miles away) and as far south as Los Angeles (96 miles away) to come in to help the small local units. In the context of the whole battle, none of the organiza tion was worth a damn. Spokesmen for all sides still boast about their “efficiency and organization,” but, in the words of one disheartened student, “everything broke down, nothing worked and most of us were either brutal or brutalized.” FOR two days, the police held back—still hoping that the moderates could succeed in Isla Vista's self‐policing ef fort, inhibited by cautious and indecisive leadership. Each night, the battle escalated. Each night, there was more fighting between moderates and radicals, more people joining either side. On Mon day night, June 8, the battle changed in character. No one now is willing to say who gave the order — or even whether the change was spon taneous or officially sanc tioned—but law‐enforcement personnel clearly adopted “get tough” tactics. They swept through the downtown loop area around the bank and into the residential blocks. A dozen different units under differ ent commands and with dif ferent attitudes and radio fre quencies went their own way —some of them on what one deputy calls a “long overdue mission to teach those brats a lesson.” Many of the 300 officers present during the final brutal days of the battle were tired; they had been in a 12‐hours on, 12‐hours‐off routine for days. Many felt authentic fear, born of innumerable injuries from rocks; the nerves of others had been frayed by the sounds of gunfire from stereo sets placed in windows of stu dent apartments. As were most students and other resi dents of Isla Vista, many in dividual policemen were fed up with the situation and wanted to end it once and for all. The Isla Vista faculty‐cler gy observer teams took down more than 600 reports of po lice misconduct. Dr. James J. Sullivan, an economics teach er who headed the program, acknowledges that many of these reflected exaggeration or cynical contrivance. But hun dreds of the reports were veri fied by “responsible wit nesses” or photographs. The signed reports, rang ing from accounts of unpro voked beatings to sexual proposition‐threats to women, depict a brutal pattern: A young man said: “I was locking my motor cycle and putting a cover over it when suddenly about six L.A. County sheriffs came running into the carport... I did not attempt to run be cause I was legally on my own property [not in violation of the 6:30 P.M.‐6:30 A.M. curfew].... The arresting officer clubbed me once in the stomach, sending me against the wall. As I was falling, he clubbed me again, in the side....” Another young man: “I was arrested for curfew when L.A. Officers broke into the apartment and beat me up while I was sitting on the toilet. They smashed up the bathroom door and pulled me by the hair and collar half nude some 50 feet to the lawn outside the apartment. I fi nally was able to pull my pants up just before I was shoved against the wall.” A young woman: “The police broke the locks on our front door, bathroom door, bedroom doors and clos et doors. They tipped over the bookcase and tore a painting off an easel and arrested the three of us, dragging us down the stairs and into squad cars.” Another young woman: “I was taken out and led up the stairs, where, on meet ing the remaining policemen coming down the stairs, a few grabbed breasts....” NOT all of the incidents and arrests involved students or other long‐haired youths. A truck driver, fixing a TV an tenna on his own home, was yanked into a squad car and thrown into jail. And 26‐year‐old Patrick J. McKinley was handcuffed while standing on the lawn in front of his apart ment, shoved into a police truck and jailed overnight. McKinley is an Isla Vista resi dent who also happens to be a Deputy DiStrict Attorney for Santa Barbara County. He carefully recalls the circum stances: “I wasn't dressed like a deputy D.A., I suppose, or how one should look sitting around his apartment. I had on a pair of blue and white striped bell bottoms, a suede jacket and an old blue T‐shirt. “I was standing on the lawn with a neighbor of mine, just after dark and I was just saying to him, ‘That curfew doesn't apply here, where we are; it's private property.’ “All of a sudden, a truck with six officers in it screeched to a stop, and one officer said, ‘There they are, get ‘em. I almost casually turned around to see whom they were talking about—there was nobody there—and by the time I turned back they grabbed us, had our hands behind our backs and were putting those plastic cuffs on us.... “I started to blurt out, ‘Hey, man, I'm a...,’ and the cop told me, Shut up and don't say anything.” Twelve hours passed before McKinley was able to iden tify himself to jailers; he was then released with no charges filed. But during the long, in credible night he observed these incidents: His neighbor friend, arms still handcuffed in back, was Maced in the face when he moved his head slowly and slightly to scratch his chin on his shoulder. On the police bus mov ing toward the jail, officers pointed shotguns into the faces of other prisoners, with such comments as: “Anybody want to call me a pig now?” and “Let's just shoot this guy.” In the crowded jail cell, many of the other prisoners had bruises and cuts. One young man with a 2‐inch, bleeding head gash asked for some Band‐Aids and was given a piece of toilet paper. When prisoners asked to make a phone call, they were usually ignored or told to shut up. Hundreds of other wit nesses expanded on the per sonal report of Deputy Dis trict Attorney McKinley. One group of young women ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

arnined into a small cell was Maced. Dozens of prisoners were forced to stand unmov ing, with their noses to a wall, all night long. Another group was stripped naked and forced to scrub the walls of the cell. Few of the almost 700 prisoners were allowed to make phone calls to a fam ily or attorney. Most prison ers were held for a day or more before being booked, and many were kept for as long as 12 hours—and forced to clean up cells—after bail had been posted. Most of the higher law‐en forcement officials involved are oblivious to or contemp tuous toward the hundreds of complaints. When questioned about doors being kicked in and private dwellings entered by police, Sheriff Webster blithely refers to “normal po lice methods” and cites the “hot‐pursuit” concept. (Sher iff Webster is less concerned about civil‐liberties‐minded critics than about the towns people who regularly demand, “Why don't you kill ‘em? Why don't you just go out there and kill those damned kids?”) Santa Barbara Police Chief Alfred Trembly is consider ably more thoughtful. He speaks with concern about the unprecedented guerrilla ‐war tactics of the anarchists in Isla Vista. (“I was a field commander in Watts, but Isla Vista is different. Here, they attack the police from the sides and rear, then attack again.”) Trembly acknowl edges that there are “hazards” in the tactic of entering pri vate dwellings and arresting individuals “when the officers are not sure of their iden tification of suspects.” But then he says emphatically that Los Angeles sheriff's deputies were “very effective in enforcing the curfew.” Some of the police miscon duct can undoubtedly be ex cused by such factors as lack of training, fragmented lead ership and inexperience in handling mass arrests. But amateurishness and sloppiness were not the only causes of the intrinsically unconstitu tional police rampage in Isla Vista. A steady antagonism runs through the comments of the law‐enforcement officials I talked with here. Clearly im plicit are these attitudes: The “kids” have to be stopped. They have too much freedom. The campus administrators don't impose enough disci pline. The courts won't pun ish the kids when they are brought to trial. The law must be enforced, “right down the line.” The kids need to be taught a “lesson” to prevent any more trouble. DURING the final mass po lice action in Isla Vista's June battle, several hundred stu dents and adults sat quietly in Perfect Park in silent protest against the violence and re pression. After about 300 of them were arrested and herd ed off to jail for curfew viola tion, a local attorney heard a police unit leader say, “There's no more room in jail for any more. Just gas ‘em good. That'll teach them.” At another moment during the June battle, Dean of Stu dents Lyle Reynolds heard a student ask a Los Angeles sheriff's deputy why his unit was moving aggressively through the residential sec tions of Isla Vista instead of just staying in the loop area around the bank. “Isn't the bank the real problem?” the student asked the deputy. “No, it's not just the bank,” Dean Reynolds heard the dep uty answer. “We've got to get up here and discipline this community.” After June 11, Isla Vista quieted for a time. An an archist says, “Why not? We were tired, and needed a bit of a rest.” A moderate student says, “Of course, that battle ended. We were all scared—desperately scared—of the cops.” Some students took their final examinations. Many just took incompletes and went home. The university gradu ated its seniors on June 14. Chancellor Cheadle, a former botanist and a tired man, spoke gamely and rationally about the role of the univer sity and the nature of free dom, then warned, “We face potential disaster, but not many seem to understand this, for the worst problems lie ahead. I want to be an op timist, but I also must be a realist.” Summer enveloped Isla Vis ta in pleasant, balmy days and the cool, foggy nights of the California coast. A local judge dismissed more than half of the defendants in curfew vio lation and other charges, not ing that they had “already been punished enough.” Some of the others have been acquitted and some have paid modest fines. (Most of the remaining 300‐odd cases are pending a court challenge to the legality of the local cur few ordinance.) The trial of those indicted on felony charges related to the bank burning began in July, and is still in progress. The Attorney General's office and a few other public agencies and pri vate groups announced studies of the “disorder” and investi gations of police conduct. ON the last day of my in quisitive week here, I took a long walk along Isla Vista's beach, avoiding the ugly globs of oil along the soft, white tideline. It was a beautiful day: gentle breezes, about 78 degrees, no smog and a clear view over the deep blue water toward the Channel Islands 25 miles away. Four young men bobbed on their surfboards just offshore. One couple tossed a frisbee on the beach. About 200 other students sat on the sand, star ing at the sea. Most of them were alone, and awfully quiet. I heard little talk," and no laughter at all.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Search Begins for Doctors To Serve During Boycott,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/31/archives/search-begins-for-doctors-to-serve-during-boycott.html,"Officials at the Albert Ein stein College of Medicine began to search for obstetricians will ing to work temporarily at Lin coln Hospital yesteday, the sixth day of a boycott there by 27 physicians.

"CITY ABORTION TOTAL IS 11,200 SINCE JULY",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/01/archives/city-abortion-total-is-11200-since-july.html,"New York City hospitals per formed more than 11,200 abor tions between July 1, when the state's liberalized abortion law went into effect, and Aug. 22, the Health and Hospitals Corpo ration said yesterday. The corporation noted that several hospitals had not yet turned in their statistics for the period. However, preliminary figures indicate that municipal hospitals accounted for 4,014 abortions; voluntary hospitals, 3,449; and proprietary hospitals, 3,745. The hospital performing the most abortions, some 1,300, was Park East, a private insti tution at 112 East 83d Street that specializes in the opera tion. Among municipal hospi tals, Kings County in Brooklyn had the most abortions, 792. Women do not have to wait as long as they did for abor tions when the law first took effect, according to the corpo ration. As a result, fewer abor tions are being done involving pregnancies of more than 12 weeks. “The corporation said it did not have accurate figures on how many women were now on the, waiting list for abortions because many women made ap pointments at more than one hospital.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plants Used by Peruvian Indians Are Analyzed as Contraceptives,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/02/archives/plants-used-by-peruvian-indians-are-analyzed-as-contraceptives.html,"The sedge is an innocuous looking, grasslike plant of many varities that grows all over South America. Two vari eties, however, are potent con traceptives, thought to be used by Indian women for centuries as their “pill.”These are not the only bo tanical contraceptives known. More than a dozen different plants used to prevent concep tion or induce abortion or fer tility have been collected by Mrs. Nicole Maxwell, a re search associate of the Museum of the American Indian Heye Foundation, who has studied the health of the Peruvian and Ecuadorian Indians for the last 20 years. Included in her work has been the collection of 300 me dicinal plants, some of which are used to interrupt or en hance the procreative process. A preliminary summary of her most recent findings of the Seuene Witoto, Jivaro, Shipi bo and Conibo tribes of the Amazon basin was reported last month at the 39th Inter national Congress of Anthro pologists in Lima And follow ing her return to the United States earlier this week, she elaborated on her observations in an interview: Because these plants are treated as secrets by the tribes that use them, they were thought to be just part of tri bal superstition, Mrs. Maxwell said. Observation and Experience But slowly, through observa tion and personal experience, she began to conclude that cer tain plants had the properties the Indians said they had. First, she noticed the size of the Indian families. There are rarely more than three or four children, she said. Then, through the years, she learned first‐hand the healing powers of the non contraceptive botanical medi cines that were given her by witch doctors when she was injured. “Many anthropologists are prone to treat everything strange as superstition,” she said, “but yesterday's science is today's superstition. There was a time when doctors would bleed people as standard medi cal practice. Today they are putting blood into people. You never know what's next. May be we have something here.” The Witotos of the Napo River area, for example, have stopped the practice of giving very young girls in marriage, Mrs. Maxwell reported, but mother still gives her daughter a potion at the age of puberty. One dose prevents conception for the next six or seven years, by which time the girl Is pre sumed mature enough for mo therhood. The Shipibo and Conibo tribes use a sedge plant in a rudi mentary prenatal care program, Mrs. Maxwell reported. A preg nant woman is given her first dose about five weeks before the baby is expected, and she continues to take a solution of roots every few days. The last dose is given at the onset of labor. The Indians say that this treatment promotes fast, almost pain‐free delivery. The plants have not been easy to collect, Mrs. Maxwell said, because they are the prop erty of the women of the tribe and are rarely given to out siders. Although she has seen and at one time possessed 17 varieties—some believed to be extremely toxic—she has only a few now, she said. A drug company has taken the samples she brought bacic in April and has set up a laboratory to study their gene sis and chemical properties. “I'm glad to get them out of New York,” Mrs. Maxwell said. “They do better anywhere but here. The air and water kill them immediately.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Books of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/02/archives/books-of-the-times-the-politics-of-the-birds-and-the-bees.html,"Since we're onto the subject of sex edu cation, where everyone has at least some qualifications to hold forth, I had better introduce my credentials immediately. At this time, I have none. Our daughter has not asked a single question; in fact when I solicitously handed her Mary Breasted's “Oh! Sex Education!” she tried to eat it OH! SEX EDUCATION! By Mary Breasted. 343 pages. Praeger. $7.95. (haying Just fin ished Richard Brautigan's “Rom mel Drives on Deep Into Egypt,” which she pre ferred). Admit tedly, she is only nine months old. The only other re cent experience I have had with teaching the young about sex was a conversa tion with a woman who told me about trying to teach her daughter the parts of her body. The child had also lately been absorbing lessons about patting animals—lessons her mother had illus trated with a pat of her daughter's head and the words, “gently, gently.” When the girl was asked to locate her genitals, she responded by patting the top of her head (gently). In short, I am so ignorant of the whole matter that I was as much attracted to Miss Breasted's report by the prospect of learning something, as I was by my admiration for Miss Breasted's writing in The Village Voice. Touching All Bases I was not disappointed. The second best thing about reading “Oh! Sex Education!” is that it familiarizes one thoroughly with the multiple facets of those touchiest of subjects: how much to tell children about sex, when to tell them, and by whom they ought to be told—their parents or their school instructors. Miss Breasted has managed all at once to explain the issues without lecturing us, to present the argu ments on every side, to introduce us to some of the arguers, and to speculate shrewdly on the background of both the noise and the noisemakers. She begins, wisely enough, with a mi crocosm—the case of Anaheim, Calif., where an advanced sex‐education program was instituted in the public‐school system in 1965, and where subsequently the fur of controversy began to fly among religious fundamentalists, right‐wing political op portunists the district superintendent who had pioneered the program, the five‐man school board, and a quiescent majority who seemed willing enough to go along with the program but curiously unwilling to shout down the vociferous minority that was to cause the program's suspen sion and its eventual curtailment. Then, having acquainted us with Ana heim—its issues, ‘stars and supernumer aries—Miss Breasted moves out into the national scene and the larger controversy. We meet aid talk with Dr. Mary Steichen Calderone, who was until 1969 executive director of the Sex Information and Edu cation Council of the United States, and her natural enemy, Dr. Gordon V. Drake, who rose from obscure origins in Wauwa tosa, Wisc., and with loud cries about how “they” were taking children away from parents, and the mystery out of sex, be came for a time the spokesman against sex education (and Dr. Calderone) for Billy James Hargis's ultra‐right‐wing Christian Crusade. And we drift among and attend group discussions with the delegates at two na tional conventions, one in favor of sex education and one against it. By the time Miss Breasted is finished, one understands the controversy. That is, as I said, the sec ond best thing about “Oh! Sex Education!” The best thing about it is that it is such an engaging book on a subject that could have run dry as shredded wheat in 20 pages. The reason it is so engaging is that Miss Breasted gives us a candid portrait of herself at the start and freely expresses her biases throughout, yet always keeps her options open and describes conflicting viewpoints so that we feel free to choose. A masterly piece of personal journalism. With Prejudice, Humility She approached her subject as a 26‐ year‐old East Coaster with a radical bent. She felt no reverence for premarital chas tity, was prejudiced in favor of sex edu cators, yet had sufficient humility and re spect for journalism to withhold judgment. As she picked her way among deeply fear ful fundamentalist housewives and cheer ful right‐wing columnists stuffed with mis information about “Swedish perverts,” among arrogant behaviorists, beaming but ever‐so‐slightly manipulative educators, and browbeaten school board members (her portraits, composed out of her sub jects’ own mouths, are often deadly), her perspective shifted by subtle degrees. She came to understand and even sympathize with many of the “Anti's.” She came to regard the Pro's as equally de termined, in their own subtle ways, to up hold a Puritan morality out of joint with the times. She came to feel strongly that neither camp had set honesty with youth as its highest ideal. And she concluded finally that “the irony of the whole bat tle was that it belonged to another age, an age when contraception and abortion weren't needed and when women were mercilessly taught to abhor or pretend they abhorred the act that was so liberally necessary to the survival of the species, because so many of their infants died.” And that the objects of all the fuss—the young people—had in the meantime moved on to more important things anyway, like, ending war and insuring the survival of the planet. I myself concluded with an apprehen sive sigh of relief that I don't have to face the problem for a little while. You may conclude whatever you wish, so long as you read Miss Breasted's book.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Smith, whose ouster from Lincoln Hospital was demanded by South Bronx militants, returned to work yes terday after receiving assur ances that he would be protect ed from personal harm. His return did not, however, end the controversy that shut Dr. Smith's department of ob stetrics and gynecology eight days earlier. Twenty‐seven other physi cians in the department walked off their jobs Aug. 25, pro testing the departure of Dr. Smith, whose ouster had been demanded by three neighbor hood groups — the Young Lords, the Think Lincoln Com mittee and the Health Revolu tionary Movement. The groups called for Dr. Smith's removal following the death of Mrs. Carmen Rodri guez after an abortion at Lin coln Hospital on July 19. An autopsy report said the death had been caused by a rare re action to the saline solution that was injected into Mrs. Ro riguez's uterus to induce the abortion. Last night Dr. Stever Tarnoff, a spokesman for the 27 striking physicians, said his colleagues had decided to be gin providing emergency serv ices at the hospital for two weeks starting this morning. Two physicians will be on duty at all times to handle emer gency cases, he said, stressing that the group was not actually returning to work. Three Demands Made Dr. Tarnoff said his group had three demands: freedom to practice in “a nonthreatened atmosphere, “an ambulance at their disposal at all times and facilities for providing emer gency Caesarean deliveries. If those demands are not met within the two‐week period, he said, the group will stop its emergency services. Dr. Smith returned to work even though most of his strik ing colleagues had urged him to stay away. Dr. Tarnoff said the physicians were under “tremendous pressure” from the city and the Health and Hospitals Corporatioir to re turn. All of the physicians are employed by the Albert Ein stein College —of Medicine, which staffs the hospital under a contract with the city's Health and Hospitals Corpo ration.

English, presi dent of the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation, said yes terday that there would be “absolutely no negotiations” with the physicians who walked off their jobs at Lin coln Hospital “until they are back on the job.” Twenty‐seven doctors left Lincoln's department of obstet rics and gynecology on Aug. 25 to protest the departure of their department chief, Dr. J. J. Smith, who said he had been forced by community militants to leave. Conditions at Lincoln have brought intermittent dem onstrations since last spring. Dr. Smith's oustel, was demand ed by the Young Lords party and other militant groups after the death of a Puerto Rican woman following an abortion at Lincoln on July 19. Dr. Smith returned to the hospital Tuesday noon, after receiving assurances that he would be protected from per sonal harm. All but two of the other physicians continued to stay away, however, declaring they would not return until they were promised improved physical facilities and a larger staff. Dr. English denounced those who continued to stay awarat a news conference yesterday. “This is not like manufactur ing automobiles,” he said. “These doctors are not factory workers. I think they should examine their consciences as physicians.” The doctors are employed by the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, which provides the professional staff of Lincoln Hospital under a contract with the city. After the walkout, most of the 27 went to work at Jacobi Hospital, another city', institution operated under a contract with the Einstein Col lege.

DOCTORS RETURN TO LINCOLN JOBS,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/04/archives/doctors-return-to-lincoln-jobs-normal-service-is-restored-in.html,"Two dozen physicians who walked off their jobs at Lincoln Hospital on Aug. 25 returned to work yesterday, restoring normal service in the hospital's department of obstetrics and gynecology. A residue of bitterness re mained, however, and the chief of the city's hospital system. Dr. Joseph T. English, scheduled a tour of Lincoln for today— including a private meeting with, the protesting doctors. Long‐standing complaints by the predominantly Puerto Rican population of the South Bronx reached a showdown 10 days ago when radical community groups, led by the Young Lords party, forced Dr Joseph J. Smith to leave the building. Dr. Smith is chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Lincoln. The militants have made va rious complaints. One of them is a charge that Dr. Smith was responsible for the death of a Puerto Rican woman after an abortion. They also protested his unsuccessful effort to dis miss a Negro physician in his department. Worked at Jacobi The 27 physicians in Dr. Smith's department left in pro test after his Aug. 25 departure. They charged that the militants were preventing them from providing proper patient care. All of the doctors involved are employed by the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, which provides the professional staff at Lincoln under an af filiation contract with the city's new Health and Hospitals Cor poration. Most of the 27 doc tors promptly went to work at Jacobi Hospital, another municipal institution in the Bronx that is also provided with physicians by Einstein. Dr. Smith returned to Lincoln on Wednesday at noon, after, receiving assurances that his personal safety would not be threatened. Better Care Sought His colleagues held out, how ever, despite a demand from Dr. English that they “examine their consciences as physi cians.” The medical college's dean, Dr. Labe C. Sheinberg, called the strike “unconscion able.” But the young house staff physicians declared that they would not return until the antiquated hospital took meas ures to provide what they re garded as adequate health care for the women patients of their department. Soon after they changed their minds and resumed work yesterday, a demonstration by the community protesters took place in the street outside the hospital's emergency room en trance. About 200 people—some wearing the purple beret of the Young Lords, others carry ing banners of the Health Revo lutionary Unity Movement and the Think Lincoln Committee, and a few women's liberation ists—gathered for an hour around a rented truck and lis tened to accusations of racial discrimination and genocide, made by various representa tives of the militant groups.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Many Having Abortions Here Journey From Out of Town,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/05/archives/many-having-abortions-here-journey-from-out-of-town.html,"A sizable number of women are coming here from out of town to get abortions under the state abortion reform law that went into effect July 1, ac cording to statistics made pubH lic yesterday by the city. The statistics are highly in complete, covering perhaps only 40 per cent of the abortions performed in hospitals here since July 1. Moreover, the fig ures on abortions performed in municipal hospitals are esti mated to represent perhaps 25 per cent of all the abortions performed so far in these hos pitals, according to an official of the Health Service Adminis tration, which released the data. Because the municipal hos pitals are performing abortions only on city residents, under representation of these hos pitals causes the figures to show a disproportionately high percentage of out‐of‐towners, he said. But even taking these fac tors into account, the first, fragmentary report on the geo graphical background of per sons undergoing abortions here shows that New York City has become the destination for many women seeking an abor tion. Between July 1 and Aug. 14 more than 2,500 of the abor tions at hospitals here were performed on women from out side the city, according to the statistics. Proportion Will Decline This was 40.6 per cent of the 6,314 abortions that were per formed in hospitals here during the same period and for which the Health Services Administra tion has compiled statistics, Michael Blumenfeld, deputy ad ministrator of the city agency, last night. Of the 6,314, only 899 were performed in the municipal hospitals and the rest in volun tary or proprietary‐institutions, which are not limited to per foming abortions on city resi dents. But the 899 is estimated by Mr. Blumenfeld to be only about a fourth of the abortions performed to date in the munic ipal hospitals here, and as de tailed data on these become available, the out‐of‐town pro portion is expected to decline in the statistics, he said. Of the 2,500 out‐of‐towners, more than 500, the highest number, came from New Jersey. Because of the underrepresentation of the municipal hos pitals, the information on New York City women getting abor tions under the new law re mains highly tentative. Of the 6,314 women in the statistics 67.3 per cent were white, 27.8 nonwhite and 4.9 Puerto Rican. A far higher, pro portion of the women getting abortions in the municipal hos pitals are thought to be black and Puerto Rican. The statistics, covering only hospitals, tell nothing about abortions being performed in doctor's offices here. A pro posed change to the City Health Code would restrict abortions here to hospitals or highly equipped clinics, but this controversial amendment has not yet been adopted. Thus, abortions in doctor's offices have so far been legal here un der the new law.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ottinger 2d Line Ruled Off Ballot,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/05/archives/ottinger-2d-line-ruled-off-ballot-partys-name-called-too-similar-to.html,"ALBANY, Sept. 4 — Sec retary of State John P. Lomenzo today ruled the newly formed Conservation party and the Right to Life party off the‐No vember ballot. I Mr. Lomenzo thus blocked al least temporarily the move by Representative Richard L. Ot linger, Democrat of Westches ter County, to appear on second line in his race for the United States Senate. A spokes man for Mr. Ottinger said ar appeal had been filed in State Supreme Court. Mr. Ottinger and a fellom Democrat, Adam Walinsky, can didate for Attorney General headed the Conservation party nominations. Mr. Lomenzo ruled that the name “was almost identical with the name Conservative party, except for the last two letters,” and so was contrary to the election law. The challenge was brought by J. Daniel Mahoney, chairman of the Conservative party, whose Senate candidate, James L. Buckley, is also running on a minor party label, the Inde pendent Alliance. Following Mr. Lomenzo's decision, Stephen Berger, cam paign chairman for Mr. Ot tinger, said: “The decision of Secretary of State John P. Lomenzo, a Republican, was not unexpected.” Anti‐Abortion Party The Right to Life party, formed with the purpose of challenging the state's liberal ized abortion laws, had nomi nated Mrs. James Gilroy of Merrick, L. I. for Governor and Mrs. Marcia Pilsner of Seaford, L. I. for Lieutenant Governor. The party was stricken from the ballot after Mr. Lomenzo ruled there were not enougn valid signatures in its nomi nating petitions, but an appeal is expected. The party origi nally filed 14,062 signatures, but during two days of hear ings in Mr. Lomenzo's office, 3,012 were ruled invalid. This dropped the total number to below the “12,000 required by law. The Secretary's office said the challenge to the Right to Life party was brought by Mor ris Zuckman, an Albany law yer. Mr. Zuckman could not be reached for comment. Other candidates affected by Mr. Lomenzo's ruling against the Conservation party include William Dretzin, for Represen tative from the 25th District, and Joseph Simmons, for Rep resentative from the 32d Dis trict. The candidacy of Represen tative Richard Max McCarthy in Buffalo will not be affected by the state‐level ruling. Mr. McCarthy lost in the Democratic primary when he ran for the Senate nomination and later filed as a Conserva tion party candidate for the House. A determination of the par ty's validity in his case will be made first by the Erie. County Board of Elections, because the district in which Mr. McCarthy is running is wholly within that county. Mr. Lomenzo announced to day that hearings on objections to petitions filed by the Cour age party, an offshoot of George C. Wallace's 1968 presidential campaign, and the Independent Alliance party would be held in his office next Tuesday. Mr. Berger, the Ottinger campaign manager, called the decision on the Conservation party “politically motivated,” and contended that “33,000 people who signed the petitions to create the Conservation par ty should be outraged.” He said the petitions were “perfectly legal and valid.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A New Look at the Police,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/06/archives/a-new-look-at-the-police.html,"WASHINGTON — Of all the nation's institutions, probably none has been under more pres sure in recent years than the police. The police have had to cope with three developments for which their old‐fashioned ways did not prepare them. There are the antiwar demonstrations in which political emotions focus on the police because they are much more accessible than the demonstrators’ real target—the armed forces. There is the upsurge in the number of young people and the “youth revolution” featuring new behavior with regard to dress, sex, and drugs. There is the arrival in the North and West of millions of Southern Negroes. These newcomers change neighborhoods, bring new values and new problems, and add a racial component to the work of predominantly white police forces. Frustrated Police Any one of these develop ments would be enough to put a police department on its mettle. All three occurring at once have brought police work to a near crisis. Everywhere there are demands for more police and for tougher police measures. Yet individual police men are increasingly frustrated and complain bitterly that the public does not back them up. It is becoming harder to re cruit men and women for the police. There is some ominous evidence that police work is ac quiring a reputation as a job to be avoided. Sons used to be proud to follow their fathers on “the force.” But a New York City study showed that in 1969 only 2 per cent of the recruits had policemen as fathers com pared with 10 per cent in 1961. Fortunately, some sophisti cated attention is now being given to the problems of the police. The monumental report of the National Crime Commis sion appointed by President Johnson was an important be ginning. Congress in 1968 estab lished the Law Enforcment As sistance Administration. Now a Police Foundation has been establidhed with a Ford grant of $30 million. The Police Foundation hopes to take a fresh look at the very nature of police work, at what it is we expect our police to do, and how recruitment, training, and methods can be improved to make the police what they ideally ought to be—not com batants in political and racial power plays, but the universal ly respected, impartial defenders of justice and of democratic values. This ideal is not unattainable. A recent public opinion poll in Britain, for example, showed that 95 per cent of the people respect their police and believe them to be courteous, honest, and doing a good job. The Brit ish police, of course, have their problems too, particularly in race relations, but there is a happier relationship between police and society. Different in Britain A major reason is that British police are not burdened with en forcing laws that are unenforce able. Gambling is legal, homo sexual relations between con senting adults in private is legal, abortions can be obtained free on the National Health Service, prostitutes are not arrested if they stay off the streets, and narcotics addicts are treated relatively leniently. By contrast, in the United States we have translated everybody's private moral standards into law from the Methodists on liquor to the Catholics on abortion. We have wound up with police forces where “vice squad” is a syno nym for payoff and potentially good policemen are demoralized by protection money flowing from illegal but enormously profitable gambling of all kinds. No real improvement in police performance is possible until Americans face up to this cor ruption and the double standard which produces it. Another obstacle to improved police work is that the police and the public both have a mis conception of what it is police mostly do. The policeman's self image is that of Sam Spade, master detective. But such studies as have been made of the ordinary policeman on his beat show that he spends most of his time helping sick people, calming noisy family arguments, clearing drunks off the side walks, going to bars and sports events to make sure that fist fights do not escalate into knif ings or riots, and providing a sense of neighborhood security by merely being visible. This analysis leaves out those police assigned full time to traffic control, working with youth gangs, and other special assign ments. This is not to suggest that policemen spend no time catch ing criminals. But it does indi cate that a policeman's relation ship with his community is more complicated than first ap pears. It is a vital relationship which needs all the careful study it can get.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hospital Target For a Test by Radicals,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/06/archives/hospital-target-for-a-test-by-radicals.html,"A potentially historic ex periment has been made this summer to see whether ghet to hospitals could be used to radicalize poor blacks and Puerto Ricans much as leftist students have used the uni versities to radicalize other students and faculty. So far, the experiment has not gone well for the radical cause. The chief experimenters have been the Young Lords, a group of Puerto Rican mili tants modeled after the Black Panthers. The institution they tried to make the Berkeley of the medical world is Lincoln Hospital, a dingy fortresslike structure in the South Bronx which provides medical care for 300,000 poverty‐stricken Puerto Ricans and Negroes. There was strategic sense in picking Lincoln Hospital, whose deficiencies and inade quacies in personnel and equipment are depressingly numerous. Even Lincoln Hos pital's one strong point, its affiliation with Yeshiva Uni versity's Einstein Medical School, which provides Lin coln's medical staff, furnished opportunities for the Young Lords. The physicians in volved are mainly white and Jewish, most of them sepa rated by a vast cultural and economic chasm from the bttlk of the South Bronx community. Moreover, the Young Lords have important allies inside the hospital, a group of radi cal young physicians, many of whom are also white and Jewish. Some of these are revolutionaries dedicated to destroying “oppressive capi talism.” Others have been radicalized by the hospital's many failings. The Young Lords’ first problem was to establish a presence in the community and get a base of operations at Lincoln Hospital. That was easily done. Last July 14 they seized control of Lincoln Hos pital building and presented a set of demands, several of which were quickly granted. These included establishment in the hospital of a Young Lords children's day‐care cen ter and of a complaint table from which members of the organization would, in effect, monitor the care given pa tients. Thus Lincoln Hospital be came a propaganda and re cruiting base for the Young Lords, but this success quick ly brought the militants into conflict with many physi cians. Young Lords in the hospital made no secret of their suspicion and hostility, and their conviction that many patients are being de liberately maltreated. They strove to intensify militancy among black and Puerto Ric an hospital workers. Some physicians were told that they were racists. In this tense atmosphere, the Young Lords looked for an issue which could be dramatized and which would fortify their desired image as the community's defender and its spokesman for badly needed improvements in the hospital. The issue came when Mrs. Carmen Rodriguez died at the hospital shortly after undergoing an abortion. The issue was first raised by several of the hospital's radical young physicians. They concluded from Mrs. Rodriguez's medical record that she had fallen victim to careless treatment and they told the Young Lords, who proclaimed that she had been “murdered.” The Puerto Ric an militants began to accuse the obstetrics and gyneco logical department of engag ing in “genocide” against blacks and Puerto Ricans. Whitewash Charged The hospital's insistence that the death had been un avoidable because of Mrs. Rodriguez's heart condition was brushed aside as at tempted whitewash. The Young Lords demanded re moval of Dr. Joseph J. Smith, head of the obstetrics depart ment. The atmosphere at the hospital grew ever more tense. After weeks of agitation against Dr. Smith, the Young Lords took up the cause of a young nonwhite physician in the obstetrics department whose contract had not been renewed. This time they de cided upon direct action to oust Dr. Smith and win rein statement of the young doctor. The Young Lords and their sympathizers, including sev eral radical physicians, in vaded Dr. Smith's office. For about six hours he was held prisoner and was badgered with demands for the rein statement of the young physi cian and for his own resigna tion. The reinstatement was granted, but Dr. Smith re fused to resign. Finally he was evicted from the hos pital by a hostile crowd which warned him not to return. At this point 27 residents and internes, almost all of Lincoln Hospital's obstetrical staff, went on strike, taking the position that they had been evicted along with Dr. Smith. More than loyalty to a superior motivated this ac tion. Each striker knew that one of his patients, too, could die and that the doctor might also be accused of murder by the Young Lords. In addition, many of the strikers were dis gruntled because of the diffi cult conditions under which they had to work, conditions preventing them from giving first class medical care and from receiving the top‐notch training in obstetrics that they had expected when they went to Einstein. The Demands With Lincoln's obstetrical department virtually out of commision, New York City's new Health and Hospitals Corporation faced its first major crisis since it began operation last July 1. The corporation responded by ob taining an injunction re straining all persons from “interfering with patient care and medical services” at the facility. With the injunction in hand and numerous police men in the hospital neigh borhood, the corporation asked the physicians to re turn and reopen the obstet rics department. But the strikers refused. They doubted that full secu rity had really been guar anteed at Lincoln. Also, they did not want to return with out a radical improvement in conditions at the hospital. In this impasse, the corpo ration's president, Dr. Joseph T. English, began applying financial pressure on Einstein Medical School. In effect, the school's administrators were informed that if the obstetri cians did not return, Einstein would lose its $28 — million contract for providing physi cians at both Lincoln Hospital and at the Bronx Municipal Hospital. Since Einstein has been in a very shaky finan cial position for years, loss of the $25‐million contract could easily result in the closing of that medical school. Einstein's dean, Dr. Labe. Schemberg, demanded that his obstetricians return, but for several days without result. Finally last Thursday the strikers gave in, though only a few of their demands had been granted. Dr. English promised to negotiate for im proved conditions after the walkout had ended. But the Young Lords rec ognized that their effort to exploit conditions in the ob stetrics department had failed and that the commun ity had lost rather than gained by their attempt to make an issue of Mrs. Rod riguez's death. The proof of that recogni tion came in the literature they distributed last week calling for a mass meeting near the hospital last Thurs day afternoon. The leaflets asked for various improve ments at Lincoln, but did not even mention the nonfunc tioning obstetrics department or the striking doctors. Thus as the week ended something approaching nor mality had returned to Lin coln Hospital. But on Dr. Smith's office door, visitors could still see a reminder of his imprisonment and evic tion, the slogans printed in red crayon: The hospital must serve the people All power to the people Death to the pigs More people, power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mercury Hazard Found Nationwide,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/11/archives/mercury-hazard-found-nationwide-mercury-pollution-in-us-found-more.html,"LOS ANGELES, Sept. 10— Mercury pollution, which suddenly emerged as a new environmental problem six months ago to worry offi cials, industry and the pub lic, has proved a far more widespread hazard than was expected. Evidence of abnormal amounts of mercury in water, fish and game birds has turned up in at least 33 states —almost twice as many as was officially foreseen even as recently as mid‐July. Reports from the 17 other states indicated no signs of mercury concentrations as yet. But the conclusion in some cases was admittedly uncertain and based on a lack of information rather than positive findings. Essen tially, qualified officials have acknowledged, the problem is nationwide. Mercury, traditionally con sidered an inert metallic ele ment and casually released into the environment by in dustry and other users, was discovered last spring in po tentially poisonous forms and quantities in the Great Lakes. There is a possible accumula tion of millions of tons from past generations throughout most of the country. The extent of this hazard is still undefined. But it is known that even minute quantities, under certain cir cumstances, can have dread ful physiological effects, and that, like some pesticides, mercury moves along the natural “food chain” from water and plants to fish, birds and humans in ever increasing concentrations. Federal and state officials have made impressive prog ress in reducing the current flow of mercury into the en vironment. But their current efforts and the long‐range eradica tion of the problem are hampered by unclear legal re sponsibility, outmoded laws and lack of information. The reports from the 50 states also led to the folloW ing conclusions: ¶The only instance of mercury poisoning identified so fa is still the case of the Huckleby family of Alamagordo, N. M which ate pork from animal that had eaten grain accidental ly treated with a mercury com pound. Two of the family's children lost their sight and re mained in comas for months. ¶While mercury‐tainted fish and birds have been found in many states, the Federal Food and Drug Administration has found none movie in interstate commerce. ¶Reduction of the entry or more mercury into the environ merit from major industria sources has proved remarkably quick and simple. ¶Control of mercury in agri culture has led—as with other pesticides—to an inconclusive administrative and legal tangle. ¶The mercury problem has cost some states and their citi zens millions of dollars in lost revenues from commercial fish ing, fishing licenses, tourism, retail fish sales and even res taurants. The states whero no evident mercury problems were found are Alaska, Connecticut, Flor ida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Ore gon, Rhode Island, South Caro lina, Utah and Wyoming. Ha waii also produced a negative report, but it was based on a lack of information rather than affirmative findings. In all the other states, mani festations of mercury have cropped up in water, fish or game birds. Concentrations of mercury in fish and birds is considered to be a threat even to “unaffected” states because of migration. “All the states are somewhat involved,” said Richard Ronk, director of the Food and Drug Administration's mercury inves tigation. “There are probably isolated mercury sources in every state. There are a lot of unanswered questions about this thing.” ‘National Scope’ Carl Klein, Assistant Secre tary of the Interior, concurred. Commenting in Congressional testimony, he said that “mer cury contamination of the aquatic habitat is of national scope.” Federal regulations set one half part per million as the ac ceptable limit of mercury in food, and a half part per bil lion in drinking water. A half part per million has been com pared in terms of proportion to a jigger of vermouth in a tank car of gin. But these limits are admit tedly arbitrary rather than real istic correlations with specific known effects on humans; the numbers were based on the smallest amount detectable some years ago. Mercury concentrations of up to seven parts per million‐14 times the allowance limit—have been found in fish and birds. There were no reports of exces sive concentrations in drinking water, which in most places un dergoes chemical treatment to neutralize a variety of common contaminants. Sources of Mercury The principal sources of mer cury are the manufacture of chlorine‐caustic soda, or “chlor alkali,” manufacturing plants, agriculture, lumber and paper making operations and paints. But there are many second ary sources. Municipal sewage often shows appreciable amounts of mercury. It has been found in some samples of newsprint. And it was found recently in Tennessee moon shine liquor, apparently from old auto parts used in stills. In some places the sources are a complete enigma. Fish in the northern reaches of Hud son's Bay were found to have excessive quantities in their systems. Lakes in Vermont, many miles from industrial plants, homes and automobile traffic, have shown mercury. Some experts think such oc currences may xesult from mer cury vapor “fallout” from in dustry, incineration or even au tomobile fumes. Mercury attacks the brain, causing neurological disorders such as blindness, paralysis and even insanity, and vital internal organs such as the liver. Swed ish scientists reported recently in the American Medical Asso ciation's Archives of Environ mental Health that mercury can also cause abortions and defec tive babies. The human toleraace level and capacity for excreting mer cury before this level is reached are still uncertain. In the biggest use, the chlor alkali industry, no mercury technically is “consumed.” About 20 of the 69 chlor alkali plants in the country use mercury in the process of con verting brine into chlorine and caustic soda. The mercury does not end up in either product, but is washed away in resid ual brine—as much as 1,200,000 pounds a year, according to one Federal estimate. Mercury originates in nature in an ore called cinnabar. Dr. David Klein, a chemistry pro fessor at Hope College in Hol land, Mich., who has studied mercury for several years, esti mated for a Congressional in quiry last July that 5,000 tons of mercury move through the global environment every year by natural processes—erosion from ore, followed by drift to rivers and the sea—and that an equal amount now circu lates annually from man's ac tivities—about one‐quarter of the latter in the United States. The lethal effects of mercury compounds became known as far back as 1960, when reports were published of 111 persons being poisoned between 1953 and 1960 from eating fish at Minimata Bay in Japan, into which such compounds were discharged by a plastics fac tory. Amount of Discharge Since then there has been in creasing evidence but neither the Government nor industry evidently inferred much from it. But on the basis of the Huckleby tragedy in New Mexi co, the Department of Agricul ture suspended the distribution of a major portion of mercury seed‐treatment compounds. At Sarnia, Ont., the Dow Chemical Company was casu ally discharging 200 pounds of mercury a day into Lake St. Clair last spring when a 35‐ year‐old Swedish chemist, Nor vald Fimreite, doing graduate work at the University of West ern Ontario, called the Cana dian Government's attention to high mercury levels in com mercial shipments of fish from the lake. On March 31, the Canadian Government banned the sale of mercury‐susceptible fish from the lake and the nearby Detroit and St. Clair Rivers. Michigan joined in the ban 10 days later. Some quick calculations in dicated that Canadian industry alone was discharging 250,000 pounds of mercury into the Great Lakes every year. The Federal Walter Quality Admin istration estimated that dis charges on the American side may have been more than twice that, with 100,000 pounds go ing into Lake Erie alone. The mercury problem found the Federal Government struc turally ill‐suited to apply quick corrective measures. Water pollution on an inter state basis is a responsibility of the Department of the In terior. The use of mercury in agriculture is a responsibility of the Department of Agricul ture, which does not have a doctor on its staff. Food con tamination on an interstate basis is a responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Drink ing‐water standards are under another branch of that depart ment, the Bureau of Water Hygiene. The Federal agency that might logically be expected to be concerned with the over‐all health threat of mercury pollu tion, the Public Health Service, lacked grounds for intervention because there have been no re ported illnesses from mercury since the Huckleby case. Congressional Hearings The chairman of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Environment, Senator Philip A. Hart, Democrat of Michigan, opened hearings on mercury pollution last’ May. But it was, mid‐July before Secretary of the Interior Walter. J. Rickel, under Congressional pressures, began aggressive moves to curb the mercury problem. He designated a task force of the Water Quality Admin istration and the United. States Geological Survey to Inventory mercury pollution sources, warned the Governors of 17 states of possible mercury prob lems and persuaded the Depart ment of Justice to file suits against 10 chloralkali plants eight chemical companies seven states that allegedly were dilatory about abating discharges. Many facilities acted speed ily. The Dow plant at Sarnia cut its 200 pounds of mercury a day to only a few pounds in few weeks. Other plants that were discharging 20 to 40 pounds a day reduced the emis sions to a pound or less. Temporary corrective meas ures were not complicated. At worst, a plant could divert fluid wastes from mercury processes into a holding pond until some sort of neutralization or recov ery treatment for the mercury could be installed. Several chlorine plants serving adjacent paper and textile mills simply shut down. Rapid Reduction “I never had a pollutant where we got reductions this rapidly before,” says Murray Stein, Federal water pollution enforcement chief. “The Erie Basin was 200 pounds a day. Now it's less than 10.” A spokesman for the Chlorine Institute estimates that the in dustry's mercury “losses” have been reduced by 95 per cent. To get quick legal action, the Government had to invoke seldom‐used 1899 law making, it an offense to discharge any thing into a waterway without permission from the Army Corps of Engineers. The lawsuits have drawn lot of criticism from industry and state officials as an un necessary and unfair “grand stand play.” Many of the suits are under negotiation between the defendants and the Federal district attorneys in various states. If the companies clean up, the actions may be settled by a device such as the consent decree. Otherwise, they are subject to a $2,500 fine for each day's violation if they are found guilty. The Federal Water Quality Administration has set as its goal the elimination of all mer cury discharges. Establishments Making “bona fide efforts” are being given three months to reduce discharges to a half pound a day and an additional three months to achieve a vir tual zero level. Systematic Check I Meanwhile, a systematic check is being made by the Hickel task force of about 600 users of mercury throughout the country to pin down mer cury “leakage” not accounted for by the chlorine industry. No additional Federal suits, accord ing to informed sources, are im minent. Internally, the F.D.A. has had its field force of 535 inspectors and 750 chemical analysts working on mercury problems, mainly helping state agencies in chemical analyses. The agency has found no fish or other interstate food products subject to seizure for contain ing more than one‐half parts per million of mercury. Governor Rockefeller of New York said Aug. 22 that reports by industrial concerns to the State Department of Environ mental Conservation indicated that mercury discharges into New York's waterways had dropped from 71 pounds a day in mid‐May to less than three pounds, and that the total would be down to less than 12 ounces by next summer. In several states, the mer cury problem has led to restric tions on fishing, resulting in millions of dollars in losses by, the fishing industry, tourism and restaurants. The closure of sections of the Tombigbee‐Tensaw‐Mobile and Tennessee River systems in Ala bama to fishing has cost the state about $300,000 in com mercial and sports fishing li censes, according to the Ala bama Conservation Depart ment. Fishing interests have filed damage suits totaling $200,000 against chemical com panies allegedly responsible for the pollution. In Michigan, the impact of restrictions on fishing in Lake St. Claire and the St. Claire and Detroit Rivers was described by some as a “disaster” to fish sales in the Detroit area and to the sports fishing business. In Wisconsin, where fishing in the 430‐mile length of the Wisconsin River was restricted, motels in some sections report edly have had 80 and 90 per cent cancellations in reserva tions. There are estimates that the resort business has sus tained losses of $1.5‐million. Public hearings on mercury pol lution control measures have brought out throngs of irate citizens, who described the mer cury and DDT problems as an industrial outrage. Scare in Kentucky Although no official warning was issued in Kentucky, pub licity about mercury pollution at Kentucky Lake, a popular fishing area, caused a wide spread scare. A fish market proprietor in Gilbertsville, Ky., said sales had dropped off $1,000 a week be cause of public apprehension. A nearby fish market that had been in operation 20 years closed down. Pinpointing mercury pollu tion in many places has been arduous and slow. Although there is equipment now that can analyze parts per billion quickly, some states have such primitive facilities that it has taken as much as three weeks to process single samples of fish and water. Minnesota alone has 10,000 sizable lakes. Montana offi cials are puzzled by mercury readings in the Clark Fork River near Missoula. In some places where chlorine plants cut off their, discharge entire ly, as much as three pounds of mercury has continued to flow out of waste channels ev ery day from old accumula tions. Dr. Klein, the Michigan chemistry professor, said in an interview that a study he made of the ocean bottom at Los Angeles’ main sewage discharge point had yielded mercury readings up to 8 parts per mil lion. The original sources are a mystery. Mercury, the only metal that is liquid at ordinary tempera tures, evaporates readily. There is no fix as yet on how much mercury may be escaping di rectly into the air from indus trial operations or coming out of smoke stacks and automo bile exhausts and thence pre cipitated by rainfall. There is a suspicion that un explained mercury in northern New England may be residues of compounds painted on fallen timber after the 1938 hurricane to preserve it until it could be harvested. Dr. Jesse Steinfeld, the Unit ed States Surgeon General, told the Congressional inquiry Aug. 27 that “the problem of health defects of toxic metals is legitimate area of concern, but not a legitimate cause for hysteria.” “Toxic metals,” he added, “must be placed in that grow ing collection of ubiquitous substances like pesticides about which we need to know much more, especially concerning the effects of low‐level, long‐term exposure?’ “We've been so busy just trying to track the stuff down that we haven't had a chance to get into other Investiga tions,” one Federal official said. Other qualified observers have a less sanguine outlook than Dr. Steinfeld has. Dr. Henry A. Schroeder gf the Dartmouth Medical School, an expert on toxic metal, said the mercury problem had opened up a whole area of problems of substances with hazardous physiological effects, including lead, cadmium, arsenic and some nickel compounds. ‘Lagged Behind’ Robert E. Jordah 3d, a De fense. Department counsel, got no arginuerit Avlien he remarked at a Cotelissiorial hearing: “Much of the’ country, includ ing portions of the Congress and other agencies, have lagged behind the mercury problem.” Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate told the same in quiry: “It's incumbent on us to ask why it took so long for industry and pollution author ities to recognize the danger. The mercury contamination re veals how very weak is our system of food testing and monitoring.” While some quarters in the Administration have implied that the mercury investigation was a coordinated effort, in quiries to the various Federal agencies have adduced little evidence of effective liaison. Federal Legislation “Mercury, more than any other environmental problem presently known, exhausts the capability of government reg ulating agencies to respond to the problem,” Dr. Albert Fritsch, a chemist and consult ant to Mr. Nader, told Senator Hart's committee: “The tangle of jurisdictions means that con trol will be indefinitely delayed unless some prompt, extraor dinary action at the Presiden tial level is forthcoming.” The idea of sweeping Federal legislation has occurred to many people, but shaping it is less obvious. There is at least one bill in Congress to provide severe penalties simply for any discharge of mercury. But it is given little chance of adoption. Senator Hart has proposed appropriations to enable the Corps of Engineers to add 200 employes so that the 1899 water pollution law could be rigorously enforced, with spe cific permits for all discharges into waterways. Senator Hart and Senator Warren C. Magnuson, Democrat of Washington, have introduced a commercial technology as sessment bill to establish a sur veillance agency to provide an “early warning system” of hazards such as mercury. Some key officials and legis lators forsee as the likeliest early answer to the “tangle of jurisdictions” the forthcoming establishment of an Environ mental Protection Administra tion that might bridge existing gaps in those statutes and co ordinate action.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A Walk On London's Wild Side,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/13/archives/a-walk-on-londons-wild-side.html,"LONDON. NOTTING HILL, like many other parts of London today, was once a de sirable residential area. That was a long while back, and al most in another country. To day the district is running slowly to seed. The squares still rustle with privileged trees; but the tall white hous es around have started, reluc tant as society beauties, to doff their elegance. The fa cades crack and peel. Gray housewives plod past to ward the shops. Children of many colors—tough, unbathed dwarfs—yell at the house wives, and each other, down the saddened streets. The transformation of the area began after the last war. Taxation and the cost of liv ing, twin vultures, had soared simultaneously, and the up keep of the large houses start ed to be too much for the owners. Numbers of them sold out to delighted property deal ers, who chopped the corpses of the houses up into bed sitters and cheap flats. They proceeded to let these to the colored immigrants who were flooding into London from the West Indies, India and Paki stan. Slowly ghettos started to spread, like filthy flowers, over Notting Hill. As early as 1958, the first race riots in British history flared up in the area. Since then, racial hatreds have re‐flared repeat edly, and repeatedly been damped down to a sullen flicker. The black‐power move ment is spreading. So is violence among young people, which is evident else where in the country as well. Gangs of Hell's Angels, influ enced by the ones in Califor nia, have started to freewheel their phallic motorbikes through the East End. Gangs of “skinheads,” disastrous and violent children with uniform ly cropped skulls, ran riot at the holiday resorts last Easter. Hundreds of them, chant ing primitive war cries, attacked peaceful families then, and have since taken to attacking Pakistanis in South London. The followers of black power, the Angels and the skinheads are all al leged to take drugs, hard or soft. Today, around some parts of Notting Hill, the policemen walk in pairs. They have the typically stately, arrogantly calm mode of ambulation which the British constable shares with the Arabian cam el. Their lips curl a little in contempt, like those of cam els, at the people they pass. There are lithe, tall Negroes loping by, some in the fur fezzes of the Black Muslims. There are also young white people. They mostly have lengthy and lank hair. Some dress in black leather, some in rather dirty flowered robes, adorned with beads and bells. Their parents thought the police existed to protect them. But they don't. The law and these young people face each other in mutual postures of suspicion and hostility. The police, not without reason, ex pect that the young people are connected in some way, as buyers or sellers, with the dope traffic. The young peo ple say that they expect noth ing from the police but framed‐up charges and unjus tified harassment. In some curious way, their, idea that they are persecuted has brought them a feeling of en gagement and solidarity. ONE of the people most familiar with this drug sub culture is a tall, willowy, 24‐ year‐old daughter of landed gentry named Caroline Coon. With a former art student named Rufus Harris and a few others, Caroline runs a private agency—supported by dona tions—called Release, which advises young addicts and pot smokers in trouble with the law and helps them with other problems as well. I recently visited the office of Release in a stubby house on a rather seedy thorough fare off Notting Hill. After climbing a musical flight of stairs, I found a long, narrow room that was crowded with psychedelic posters, filing cabinets, desks, telephones and young people. Miss Coon, wearing a red dress, rose from a desk and shook my hand. There is elegance in her quick voice and the ripple of her hands. “I was an art student in 1967,” she said. “That was a really bad year for young people. Anyone who was young and had long hair was liable to be picked up on sus picion of drug possession by the police. They'd pick peo ple ap in the streets, or they'd raid their flats. It happened to me and to some of my friends. A lot of the kids didn't know what their rights were, and the police took ad vantage of that.” She paused for a moment. “You know, in that bad year, in 1967, all of us who were young had the sense of be longing to a community. You'd walk down the street at night, and you'd hear bells on the other side of the road. You couldn't see the person, but you'd know, if he wore bells, he was young, he was— how does one say it?—one of our people. I thought I ought to help. You see, because of my background, my accent even, I knew how to manipu late authority. I could deal with policemen and solicitors and all that sort of thing.” The floor was strewn with anxious, shaggy young peo ple waiting to consult Rufus. The other helpers were busy on the telephone, talking to solicitors. “Chicks who want ed abortions started to come to us,” Miss Coon said. “Kids who were being evicted by their landlords. Kids fresh out of prison who wanted clothes. We give them all advice. We've got a little money and we help the ones who really need it.” She laughed. “Of course a lot of people come around trying to bum money off us. “If a kid comes in and says he's hungry, I tell him to shove off down the road and wash dishes in Lyons's to make some bread. But a chick who's really desperate for an abortion—people like that— we do try and help as much as we can. And if a junkie comes to us for help, the first thing we do is get him regis tered as an addict with the Health Service. That way, he can get his fixes without be ing bugged by pushers. We've doctors who help us, and so licitors. Even clergymen. We can help the kids, you see. We do help the kids.” The sunlight of London, faint and smeary at the best of times, was dying outside the window. “Why are kids today like they are?” mused Miss Coon. “Because of the world today. The hippie kids are full of spiritual and mysti cal problems. It's an inward quest for them, to discover their relationship with the world as it is.” This seemed to me a slightly unmeaningful statement, but Miss Coon didn't elaborate. “The hippie kids are mostly middle‐class, you know,” she said. “They get off the hippie kick, usu ally, unless they're hooked on hard drugs. The Angels and the skinnies are quite differ ent. They're nearly always working class. They've watched their parents scrimp and save all their lives. They don't like what society's done to the parents. That's why they do what they do. They're mostly on soft drugs—amphet amines like ‘Purple Hearts,’ usually—and they work, as a rule, during the day. By the time they're 20 or so, they usually stop being Angels or skinnies, simply because they can't afford to be. They all settle down.” The office was dark, and everybody except Rufus and Miss Coon had gone home. “We give these pop concerts,” she said, “at the Round House on Sundays. All the kids come. We charge 8 shillings a time to the ones who can afford it, and those who can't we let in free. You ought to come to one. Will you arrange it, Ru fus, for next Sunday?” THE Sunday of that week, as arranged, we visited the Round House. It is in North London, and at one time was a shed where railway trains were parked. It is large, dark and dirty, and smells of soot. When we visited it, it also smelt of cannabis. A pro longed roar of music, like the sirens of many express trains, filled the corridors that sur rounded a vast amphithea ter, where psychedelic lights twitched and flashed, and 2,000 young people were danc ing. The quiet, quizzical smile of Rufus awaited us. He led me into the coffee bar. Here there appeared to be several hun dred other young people. Some were dressed as Ameri can Indians; some wore Eliza bethan clothes; some, old nightshirts. Some drank cof fee and talked; some crouched on the banquettes, listening to the music with a passionate intensity that surprised me, since the music was so very audible. Some, ragged and bearded, sprawled on mat tresses along the walls, un conscious, and I realized that the faint hint of cannabis in the air was coming from them. “We have a doctor here,” Rufus said, “in case anyone takes an overdose. And we've a solicitor here, in case the police decide to make a raid. They never have yet, but we wouldn't be sorry if they did. It would be a sort of test case. The point is that if we find someone with drugs, we do try and take them away; but if we miss them, it's surely much better for them to be taking the stuff here, where there is a doctor handy, than to be doing it in their pads.” Three skinheads hunched along the bar counter. They had Nazi crew cuts and cheap, sharp suits, and they looked very young and very, very tough. “We get a few of them in here,” Rufus said, “and a few Angels. But nobody ever makes trouble, at least very seldom. They're not all young people, you know, who come here. Some are quite old. Look at Eddie, over there. Eddie's a tramp.” Eddie was about 50. He wore a Red‐Indian head band, and his somewhat grimy wrists were encircled with bracelets and bells. “Yer, I'm on the road,” he said. “But whenever I'm in London I drop in here on a Sunday. It's a wunnerful place, i'n'it?” A declamatory blast of music rose and obliterated his next sentence. “It's peace ful, that's why I like it,” Eddie said. “And the kids here, they're wunnerful kids. They're loving to each other, that's what I like.” A ragged young man came up to us. He wore blue eye shades, and with him was a skinny, sexless child, who turned out to be female. “I want bread, Rufus,” the young man said. “Rufus, I need bread, man.” The girl said nothing, but her immense eyes widened like blue stains in the pallor of her face. Rufus rid himself of the young man po litely and without embarrass ment. “He's just out of Pen tonville,” he told me, “for stealing a couple of pairs of trousers. He was lucky not to be sent to Broadmoor [pris on].” I liked Rufus very much, but the Round House de pressed me more and more. It was not only the deafening music, which had already made my head ache, or the flickering lights, or the smell. It was the spectacle of so many people all dressed up in the same uniform, listening to the same sound, doing the same thing, without any ap parent critical faculty what ever. They were gentle and passive, they accepted one another, but an unquestioning acceptance of others is not really what I think life is about. I crossed over to the skinheads at the bar. They, I thought, certainly did not accept others unquestioningly. THEY eyed me shiftily, shoulders hunching up under their cheap suits, hands deep in their pockets. Their manner changed when I said I was from the press. “Oh, yeah,” the shortest and toughest one said. “Yeah, we'll give you an interview.” His name was William. He and his friends all came from the London suburb of Ilford. They were so unified in themselves as almost to possess a communal face. They were all 16 years old; they lived on the same road; two were employed in the same shop, the other in one a few doors away. “We came here with some salts* we picked up Dagen ham way,” William said. “But we lost ‘em in this mob, like. This isn't our scene, anyway. We don't like hippies.” He stared around with a fish eyed hostility. “But we ain't looking for any bovver** to night. We're ready, though, if anyone takes a liberty. If any one stares at us, if anyone makes remarks about us — well, that's a liberty, isn't it? They got to expect what they get” He fished a steel comb out of his pocket. Several teeth in the middle had been sawn out. “This is what they get. We comb their faces with it, right? Then we get our heads down and butt ‘em in the face. You do that proper, and it breaks their nose in two places. Then when they're down, we put the boot in. We've our bovver boots, see?” They pirouetted, like an ungainly trio of dancers, to show me their heavy leather boots, studded with nails at toe and heel. At this point, two small boys, crew‐cut too, sidled up. “My *Salts, peaches, tasties are all skinhead terms for girls. **Bovver means bother, trouble. twin brothers,” William said, “Big Toy and Little Toy. Nine years old, they are, and proper little skinheads.” The children also wore bower boots. “Toys,” com manded William, “tell the gentleman if you can bash a grown man up.” The twins smiled, and said they could, if they had a few other skin heads of their own age with them. “Why are we skinheads?” William said. He paused a moment, as though puzzled. “We got the same interests, like. See, we like tasties, we like a drop of booze, we like soft drugs. And we all belong together, like. Nobody can touch us when we're all together. Even the fuzz is a bit scared.” THE Hell's Angels, I was told by Rufus, were camping out in a derelict church hall behind Notting Hill. It was dark when we reached it. It gaped at us through the dark ness with an eyeless look, since every windowpane in the front had been smashed. No lights were visible. We climbed the steps to the en trance, our feet making a noise like fire amid broken glass, and peered dubiously in. Nothing was visible. Suddenly, however, a stone came flying out of the door, nar rowly missed my head, and clattered into the roadway. At the same time there was a scrambling sound from in side, as though of some large malevolent animal. We re turned to the car, deciding that exploration would be easier by daylight. Next morning, we went inside. What had been the church hall, a large high room, was a shambles. The Hell's Angels had scrawled their thoughts, which were far from profound, all over the walls in red paint. Broken furniture had been piled in the center of the hall and ap parently set afire, since it was charred and misshapen. There was a heap of excrement in one corner. While we looked at all this in silence, there was a scuttling sound and several gray rats emerged from a pile of rubbish near the window. The rats were, in fact, the only inhabitants of the house —apart from the rubbish. We searched it thoroughly, but there were no Angels. Downstairs, the rooms were crammed with filthy mat tresses on which they had ap parently slept. When we emerged from the house at last, an accusing policeman with a notebook was awaiting us. He wanted us to explain what we'd been doing inside. We produced our press cards, and he relaxed. “Yes, sir, there were 200 or 300 Angels in there a few weeks back. It was exactly the same state inside as it is now. Beats me how they stuck it. But they were there for months. It was derelict prop erty, so they had squatter's rights. We couldn't shift ‘em. [Under a 19th‐century statute, a person living in an aban doned building cannot be evicted.] Then they all left. You'll find a few of them, maybe, camping in there after dark, but not often.” Why did they leave? Ap parently, a few weeks before, an American had visited the house, carrying £1,000 on him, in cash. At some point during his visit, the Angels attacked him. The American fled down the front steps, and ran into the road. The Angels followed him, and stabbed and kicked him to death outside the house. A mass exodus fol lowed, to evade the police. What, I inquired, was an American with £1,000 doing in the company of Angels in the first place? Ah, said the policeman, that was part of the trouble. The American wasn't a very savory customer anyway. He was a pusher, and he'd come to the house to do a deal with the Angels. “There's nothing very un usual about it, actually, sir,” he said. “Look around Notting Hill and you'll find more pushers than you've eaten hot dinners.” TWO days later, I met my first pusher. This was a dif ficult business to organize. The pusher kept changing his mind as to whether or not he wanted to see me—and if so, where and when. Eventually, I met him in a back room off Notting Hill. He was a tall young man, with a curious complexion. It was as though a pale wax had been spread over his face, and somehow blurred his features. Even his long, unwashed dark hair and beard looked artificial. He talked in a harsh, rapid, posi tive voice with a northern accent. I asked him his name. “I've got a lot of names, man,” he said. “But you can call me Gypsy.” A short silence fol lowed, which Gypsy broke. “I'm a witch, you know,” he informed me, and waited for me to be shocked. I obliged him, and he continued. “Like, through my reading in books of Oriental lore, I have de cided that all religions in the world are the same. When I meet a person who needs help, I transform him by the power of the right hand, and relate him to the Tree of Life, which is the synthesis of all religion. “I can tell another witch, even if I only pass him in the street,” Gypsy said. “Like, man, I feel the cat's mystical emanations trying to over power me. I'm a white witch, of course, but if a black witch puts something on me, I will use the power of the left hand. People know about my powers. Lots of cats come to me for something.” This seemed to me unfortunately phrased. “I'll bet they do,” I said. Gypsy looked at me hard. “Like, right at this time,” he said, “there is a duchess who is dependent on my spiritual powers.” I had never met a pusher before, but I had certainly never expected the first one I met to talk like the Maha rishi. I attempted to bring Gypsy to the topic we had actually met to discuss—drugs —but he was, like the Maha rishi, hard to pin down. Eventually he said that his powers had told him that hard drugs endangered peo ple's souls; they had further informed him that it was his mission to save souls by sell ing soft drugs and LSD. “LSD,” he said, “opens the doors of the mind. Chinese, Indian and Inca lore tell me that.” He became rather more down‐to‐earth. “Cats deal with me because I'm honest. I never sell anything which I haven't tasted myself, which I'm not certain is 100 per cent pure. See, there's a lot of Chinese heroin coming in now. It's being flogged all round Lon don by the Mafia. The stuff's poison. I'd never sell anything like that. The Mafia know me. I'm in danger from those cats, man. They control the dealing around Notting Hill.” Gypsy's personality, it struck me, was rather like his features. For all his mes sianic pronouncements, it was blurred, and the confidence he exuded seemed rather false. Under all the pretense of philosophy, it seemed to me, was a sad, silly young man, so bored with himself that he was driven to tinker with dope and exotic cults about which he really knew very little. The tragedy seemed to me that he was so repre sentative of so much of British youth. I VISITED next an addict, who lived in an expensive flat in a neat whitewashed mews off Notting Hill. A small, shy young woman opened the door. “Do come in,” she said. “John's waiting for you.” She led us into a bedroom where a tall, extremely emaciated young man turned in welcome. His face was intelligent and handsome, but the flesh on it seemed to have fallen away, hollowing his cheeks and deepening the sockets of his eyes. He had long, fair hair and a beard. The comparison was easy, but he really did look like a painting of Christ. He sat down on the floor. We sat on the bed. There was nowhere else to sit, since the room, though tidy, was clut tered with books stacked around the walls, a chess set, a flute, paints and brushes, ornaments, records — objects which had a civilized look. On the floor by the bed was an open tin box containing syr inges, ampoules and absorbent cotton. With a faint, enig matic smile, John watched me looking at them. “I'm 26 now,” he said, “and I've been on drugs since I was 15. My father was a diplomat in Calcutta then, and I. hap pened to come by some opium. I took it, and, well, it's always the same story after that, and I won't bore you with it. I used to write poetry then, and paint. It probably wasn't very good, but after I got hooked I stopped doing anything at all. I married, but my habit ruined that as well. My wife left me … I don't blame her. Last year, I was in Europe. I took an overdose by mistake and nearly died. Then a little later I couldn't get any at all, and that nearly killed me too. You've no idea of the pain when you can't get it—phys ical and mental. Imagine the worst pain you can think of, multiply it ten thousand times, and you'll still have no idea.” The girl who had opened the door sat on the floor at the far end of the room. She sat very still, her large dark eyes fixed on John with an expression of pain and tender ness so acute as to shake me. Christ and the Madonna. “Please don't take any photo graphs of her,” John said. “She's in enough trouble with her father already.” She smiled suddenly at him. “I was a photographer once, quite successfully: drugs washed that up for me.” His long white hands had started to twitch a little, and his voice had slowed and slurred. “Why is it one gets the habit? I suppose anyone who's weak, who's screwed up, who's unhappy, is likely to be very susceptible to drugs. It does help, but the awful thing is that the great effect on a person is to make him passive. You don't want to do anything, or to live, between fix and fix. That was really what most started to terrify me about my habit. I felt that no man should live without doing something.” His hands were twitching more now. “When I came back from Europe this year, I went to Release. The first thing they did was to register me as an addict. I told them I wanted to kick the habit. They sent me to a center for treatment, and they fixed me up with a grant at an art school, study ing ceramics. I may not ever be very good at making pots, but at least I'll be doing some thing. Then some friends lent me this flat, which was marvelous, since I live on £4 a week.” He rose, smiling and twitch ing. “Excuse me. I'll have to take my medicine now. The treatment's working fine, but the cure'll take a little while, so my doctor put me on this stuff, to keep me going. It's a heroin substitute, metha done.” He went into the bathroom to wash his arm, but continued to talk. “Other people have helped me a lot. You need help to kick this habit. You need some interest outside yourself.” The girl smiled. “When she was away at Easter,” John said, return ing from the bathroom, “I nearly went mad. You have to have someone to talk to, you know.” He squatted on the floor. The girl fetched him a syringe and ampoule from the box by the bed. He took his belt off with rather shaky hands, looped it around his fore arm and tightened it into a tourniquet. A blue vein leaped up on the blanched skin. John looked up and smiled. “I shall talk more coherently soon.” He pushed the needle into the vein. The girl's eyes had closed, and her lips were parted, as the Madonna's might have at the transfixion of Christ. “That's all right, love,” John said. He took the needle out. A small black drop of blood oozed after it, and spread like oil across his skin. He leaned back and closed his eyes. The girl came with a cloth to wipe the blood away. She knelt beside him, silent, her black hair falling like a river over his starved and eloquent hands.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BISHOP MEDEIROS DISCUSSES ISSUES,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/13/archives/bishop-medeiros-discusses-issues-sends-tv-message-to-new.html,"BROWNSVILLE, Tex., Sept., 12—The Most Rev. Humberto S. Medeiros sat quietly behind his desk this week, staring out a glass wall of his office toward the Fort Brown Resaca, a sort of slough of the Rio Grande, while a Boston television cam eraman finished loading into his camera. Then Bishop Medeiros turned to the camera and began read a message of love to the 1.9 million Roman Catholics in his new archdiocese of Boston, the second largest diocese in the United States (only Chicago is larger). The Bishop's voice, which in his four years in Texas has be gun to slur just a bit, became crisply Bostonian as he read. The Bishop is of Portuguese an cestry. Bishop Medeiros was appoint ed Tuesday to succeed Richard Cardinal Cushing, the ailing 75‐ year‐old present Archbishop of Boston, whose gravel‐throated voice became familiar to mil lions of Americans at the tele vised funerals of President Ken nedy and Senator Robert F. Kennedy. Bishop Medeiros, who for six years was a parish priest in Fall River, Mass., south of Bos ton, said he had met several members of the Kennedy family. He made himself available for questioning by newsmen for hours Wednesday and gave gen eral answers to questions. On such topics as abortions, celibacy and priesthood for wo men, he said that he fully en dorsed the views of Pope Paul VI. On the Vietnam war, he said, “I wish it had ended yesterday. But I do not know how to end it. And I pray every day that it will be brought to an end. But it is our Government which has to make the decision on how to end it.” He said that the church should be involved in politics “whenever there is a moral is sue.” For a moment, the Bishop seemed about to add to this, but he did not. Of parochial schools, he de clared, “I am in accord with the Vatican. Catholic schools are very important. We need good Catholic schools to provide a good Catholic education.” But he noted that the church was finding it harder and harder to keep its schools open because of increasing costs. His four years as head of the Brownsville diocese, one of the smallest and poorest in the Catholic Church, have been blessing for him, Bishop Medei ros said. This summer and last, he traveled with migrant farm workers as they moved north from Texas to the Canadian border, picking crops. “I was the one who came back en riched,” he said. “In our valley, most of our people are so poor, but they are still a joyful people.” The Bishop said he had learned from the migrants, who make up the bulk of his 260, 000 Texas parishioners. “They have taken delight in the sim ple joys of life,” he said. “They have no despair.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HOSPITALS SEEK NURSES ABROAD,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/13/archives/hospitals-seek-nurses-abroad-institutions-here-place-ads-in-foreign.html,"“We have rewarding open ings in all nursing units,” reads an advertisement in a recent Sunday Times of London. “St. Vincent's Hospital & Medical Center … a teaching & learn ing hospital … In the center of Greenwich Village, New York City, you will be close to art, sports, theater and music, just steps away.” In an effort to ease a nursing shortage that has been particu larly severe in the last year or so, a number of New York hos pitals have been recruiting abroad. Mount Sinai Medical Center has begun advertising in nurs ing journals in Britain, Canada, Australia and Ireland. Some other voluntary hospitals have been talking to private agen cies that arrange for the im port of foreign nurses. And the new Health and Hospitals Cor poration, which oversees the city's 18 municipal hospitals, is considering ways to attract for eign nurses as part of a major recruitment drive to open soon. Some of the hospitals, in cluding Mount Sinai, have con ducted overseas campaigns in the past. The Department of Hospitals, which was in charge of the public hospitals until last July, began placing ads in nurs ing journals abroad three years ago. But St. Vincent's campaign is its first venture abroad. The nursing shortage is “no more critical now,” than be fore, a St. Vincent's spokesman said. However, the response to newspaper advertising here and elsewhere in the United States has not been good, so the hospital placed several no tices during July and August in London's Sunday Times and Daily Express and in two news papers in Ireland. More than 100 nurses have replied to the ads, but St. Vin cent's has not yet accepted any one. “We can use a score or more,” said the spokesman. But she explained that this number would fill a long‐range need. Right now, hospitals seeking visas for prospective foreign employes face a wait of at least 10 months before the nurse is given a number under the worldwide quota system enacted in 1965. Foreign nurses seeking visas on their own must wait longer. Immigrants from England and Ireland, previously unham pered because the countries had such large quotas, now must wait their turn. Students Specialize As a result, Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital, most of whose staff is from these two countries, is facing a mod erate nursing shortage for the first time. One reason for the hospital's use of so many for eign nurses is their training. In the British Isles, student nurses can elect to major in specialties required at Manhat tan Eye, Ear and Throat. Nurs es here specialize only after graduating from schools that give broad general training. A spokesman for the Immi gration and Naturalization Service said there was no emergency provision under which nurses could be brought into this country outside the quota system if they were bad ly needed here. But, they said, under a recent amendment to the law, hospitals may petition for special visas for nurses and doctors to fill positions tempo rarily. Higher salaries here are a major attraction for the for eign nurses. One problem in recruiting— and a reason for the shortage — is a lack of housing. Beth Israel Hospital Center — which has no nurse shortage — at tributes its situation in part to the fact that it has subsidized apartments for the nurses. Another reason for the short age is a reluctance on the part of many nurses to endure the discomforts and hazards of liv ing in New York City. Montefiore Hospital and Medical Center in the Bronx reports that the main problem is a large turnover. Nurses are moving out of the city and others are returning to school. The shortage at Flower and Fifth Avenue Hospitals is most acute for evening and night shifts. “People are worried about coming to work at those hours,” said a spokesman. To ease the problem, the hospital provides bus service to and from the nearest subway sta tion. Officials of most voluntary hospitals questioned in a sur vey last week declined to char acterize their nursing shortage other than to acknowledge that it exists. Abraham Freedman, administrator of Bronx Leb anon Hospital, said the situa tion there — “extremely deli cate” two or three years ago — now was “a little less se vere.” The director of nursing at Mount Sinai would say only that “we're short.” But a spokesman for the Health and Hospitals Corpora tion, Layhmond Robinson, said: “We have only half the nurses we need.” The municipal hos pitals have about 4,100 regis tered nurses and need 8,000. Three years ago they had only 3,500, but since then new narcotics and abortion pro grams, among others, have in creased the nurse workload. And so, although the author ized number of 8,000 positions hasn't changed, the “need” was described as greater.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Eight Catholic Bishops Protest To WCBS on Abortion Report,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/17/archives/eight-catholic-bishops-protest-to-wcbs-on-abortion-report.html,"Eight Roman Catholic bish ops of the metropolitan area complained yesterday that a WCBS‐TV newscast on abor tion had conveyed anti‐Catho lic bias and ignored moral and ethical questions. The report, shown on the 6 and the 11 P.M. newscasts Mon day night, showed an abortion being performed in a Greenwich Village town house. The protesting bishops are Cardinal Cooke, Archbishop of New York; Thomas A. Boland, Archbishop of Newark; George W. Ahr, Bishop of Trenton; Lawrence B. Casey, Bishop of Paterson, N. J.; Walter W. Cur tis, Bishop of Bridgeport, Conn.; Michael J. Dudick, Bishop of the Byzantine Ruthenian Ep archy of Passaic, N. J.; Walter P. Kellenberg, Bishop of Rock ville Centre, L. I., and Francis J. Mugavero, Bishop of Brook lyn. The bishops said: “We ob ject on the ground that the presentation focused on the methods of performing an abor tion, to the exclusion of the moral considerations and the complex human motivations that are always a part of the abortion dilemma on the per sonal level.” Alan P. Sloan, vice president, general manager of WCBS‐TV, issued a statment in reply, say ing that the purpose of the re port was to illustrate a ques tion now before the New York City Board of Health, whether abortions performed in doctors’ offices should continue to be permitted. “The public and medical is sue here,” Mr. Sloan said, “is whether abortions should be performed only in hospitals and hospital affiliated clinics.” Mr. Sloan noted that on the Tuesday at 6 news show, WCBS‐TV conducted an inter view with Dr. Robert Hall of Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, who gave his reasons for objecting to office abor tions. “These two reports presented opposing medical views on the appropriatenes of abortions outside of hospitals,” Mr. Sloan said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unofficial Sex Booklet Draws Mixed Notices at Yale,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/17/archives/unofficial-sex-booklet-draws-mixed-notices-at-yale.html,"NEW HAVEN, Sept. 16— Young men and women reg istering at Yale University this week are being handed a 64‐page booklet entitled “Sex and the Yale Student.” The booklet was prepared by a committee of students and faculty members and answers such questions as, “Is promiscuity common on the campus?” and “Is there something wrong with me because I don't feel ready to have intercourse yet?’ The booklet also exten sively covers birth control methods, discusses abortion and venereal disease and car ries information on campus groups that deal with sexual issues, including the women's liberation movement and a homosexual discussion group. An Unofficial Publication Dr. Elga Wasserman, a special assistant to the presi dent of Yale, said that while students had been given per mission to distribute the booklet on campus, it was not an official university publication and did not have official university approval. “It's a student publication,” a university spokes man said, “which the univer sity feels was desperately needed and therefore the stu dents were given full co operation with it.” Similar booklets have been published at Boston Univer sity, the University of Cali fornia at Berkeley and Mc Gill University in Montreal. Some Yale students have expressed disapproval of the booklet, but most seem to agree with Larry Thomas, a graduate student from San Francisco who exclaimed: “It's absolutely great!” Many gave the impression that they thought the booklet was a university project and they praised the institution. “I'm very pleasantly sur prised that Yale is being so wise in giving this sort of thing out,” said Steve Hanig man, a sophomore from Bos ton who glanced hurriedly through his copy. “I think it's a beautiful thing,” said Joanna Hutchin son, a senior from Southport, Conn. But Janet Fairchild, a senior from Freemont, Calif., shook her head. “I think it's terrible,” Miss Fairchild said indicating she felt the booklet tended to exploit women. Some freshmen girls were surprised at the frankness of the booklet, but Liz Hokada of Honolulu said, “I think it's good because it provides medical advice. If you know about it and need it, you know where to go.” The booklet, which has a photograph of Constantin Brancusi's sculpture “The Kiss” on the cover, is an out growth of a noncredit course on human sexuality directed last spring by Dr. Philip Sarrel, an assistant profes sor of obstetrics and gyne cology. He said that the committee had spent six weeks prepar ing the booklet. The first printing of 10,000 copies cost about $2,000, which came from a surplus in funds from the sexuality course for which a fee of $5 was charged. Dr. Sarrel, who is offering the course again this fall, said other surplus funds would be used to establish what the booklet described as a “sexuality, shelf” in each of Yale's 12 residential col lege libraries and to begin a pilot for a short film on college sexuality. Dr. Sarrel, who is 33 years old, returned to Yale after a tour of the military last fall when the first women stu dents were admitted. There are now 750 women among the 4,800 Yale undergradu ates. Dr. Sarrel and his wife, Lorna, are in charge of a Sex Counseling Service that is a part of the mental hygiene clinic of the Depart ment of University Health. Promiscuity is Discussed On the question of promis cuity, the booklet says that at the start of the year, with students experiencing a new sense of freedom away from home and looking for new friends, there is movement from one relationship to an other and sexual experi mentation within those rela tionships that “might be con sidered promiscuous.” “However,” the booklet goes on, “although there are some students who can have intercourse with more than one person … most students feel that it's difficult for them to maintain this kind of relationship for a long period of time.” And what about those who don't feel they are ready for intercourse? “Our data in dicate that about half of all undergraduates at Yale have not had intercourse,” the booklet says. “There are many couples who sleep to gether, but who feel they are not ready to have intercourse until they are ready to make the commitment that birth control implies.” Counseling from the De partment of University Health is recommended before hav ing intercourse so as to “avoid the anxiety of hav ing a possible unwanted pregnancy on your mind.” According to the booklet, “several informed and quite sophisticated” Yale coeds be came pregnant last fall. Under the heading, “Find ing Out If You're Pregnant,” the booklet suggests: “May be it is only midterms or tear gas or dieting or even recent travel, for any of these can postpone ovulation and con sequently your period. Or maybe it's just nerves or stress in adjusting to a new environment. “Or maybe,” the booklet says finally, “you are preg nant.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Labor and Business Fight Leaded‐Gas Tax as Costly,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/17/archives/labor-and-business-fight-leadedgas-tax-as-costly-labor-and-business.html,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 16— The idea of introducing unlead ed gasoline to help clean up the nation's air ran into oppo sition today from both business and labor on the ground that the cost would be too high. A House Ways and Means Committee hearing today pro duced testimony that the price of gasoline, leaded or unleaded, would go up about three cents a gallon if the Nixon Adminis tration's new lead additive tax becomes law. Representatives of organized labor argued against the tax, contending it would hit hard at the consumers, particularly those in the low‐income brack et. Business representatives argued that the levy would create inflationary pressures. Their opposition here came at a time when warnings are arising elsewhere from petro leum technologists, medical ex perts, oil companies and auto mobile makers that removing lead from gasoline will be far more complicated and costly than the public may under stand and that it will not quickly guarantee a cleaner atmosphere. These scientists and other ex perts ticked off the complex set of variables involved, such as: ¶Lead additives are being re placed in the new gasolines by other additives that themselves contribute to air pollution. ¶The lower octane ratings of the new products mean that more gasoline is needed to pow er a car, hence more tailpipe pollutants. ¶Most of the cars on the American roads are not de signed to run on lower grade gasoline and it will probably be three to tour years before even a majority are. ¶Unleaded gasolines being marketed in some areas are running into sales resistance because the motorist is paying more for a less efficient, al though ???? product. ¶It will take years to build new pumping and storage facil ities in each of the nation's 250,000 service stations so that each will be equipped to offer at least one type of unleaded gasoline. ¶Since lead is responsible for only about half of the “dirt” Continued on Page 36, Column 1 spewing from automobile tail pipes the increasing number of vehicles is going to raise the total amount of air pollution. “I've heard these arguments many times before and some of them are quite valid, but the overlooked point is that we will have to get the lead out of gasoline and the sooner we start the better,” said one of the nation's top auto pollution experts, Dr. Arie J. Haagen Smit, professor of hiorganic chemistry at the California In stitute of Technology. Dr. Haagen‐Smit said that even with the use of unleaded gasolines, the “all‐clear signal isn't going to be sounded” in the smog‐bound l.os Angeles basin for years and that it might be the end of the decade before the new fuels would help reduce auto pollution there. “But even the start we have made is better than none at all,” he said. At the House hearing today, the smaller oil companies said it would take them longer to be able to refine unleaded gasoline in quantity and thus put them at an unfair marketing position with their larger competitors. The major oil companies makine or about to make un leaded gasoline were absent from today's hearing. At least one set a suggested list price on unleaded fuel of three cents a gallon more than its leaded equivalent. The price difference is double or triple the extra cost to make unleaded fuel that has been estimated by Federal officials. Testimony today indicated that the Administration's pro posed $4.25‐a‐pound tax on lead additives, which is ex pected to raise over $1‐billion a year, would translate to an additional refining cost of 2.3 cents a gallon for leaded fuels. How much this amount would be increased when passed along to the consumer was not estimated. Representative Paul G. Rogers, the Florida Democrat who is a champion of clean air laws assailed the suggested tax, calling it a “multibillion dollar conflict of interest.” He noted that officials of the De partment of Health. Education and Welfare had stated that the use of leaded gas should] he terminated in stages be cause it presented a health hazard, while Treasury Secre tary David M. Kennedy said it ought to be taxed. During today's hearing Rep resentative John W. Byrnes, Republican of Wisconsin, asked repeatedly for elaboration of testimony. He said that he did not understand the issues in volved. Scientist Skeptical At least 14 oil companies are either selling or plan to sell in the near future unleaded gasoline, or motor fuels that have had most of their normal amount of lead removed. In troduction of the new fuels has been accompanied by pro motional campaigns stating that the products will help reduce air pollution. But will they? While leaded gas does sig nificantly add to air pollution and may be harmful medically, one Federal scientist familiar with petroleum technology said: “It may he heresy, but doubt that the headlong rush to unleaded gas will have any significant impact on the en vironment for at least a decade.” In addition to sale of the new unleaded products, the au tomotive industry has rede signed the engines installed in most of the 1970 and 1971 model cars to permit efficient operation on the new fuels. Executives of the major De troit automobile makers have stated that within a year or so almost every new car will be able to use unleaded gaso lines. The engine innovations by the companies were prompted as much by the passage of strict Federal auto pollution laws as they were by industrial self‐interest and the complaints of conservationists that the in ternal combustion engine was fouling the countryside. Dr. Haagen‐Smit said the new engines, the new gasolines plus the planned antipollution devices would make significant reductions in the amount of dirt, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and oxides of nitro gen that automobiles emit. The antipollution devices, which are only In the trial stages, filter exhaust fumes through a catalyst that detoxi fies much of the harmful com bustion products. A major impetus to the intro duction of unleaded gasoline is that the catalysts will not work efficiently if they filter highly leaded fuels, according to the consensus of experts. Another reason is health. As Dr. Haagen‐Smit put it: “Many members of the medi cal profession feel that we have come too close to reaching tol erable levels of lead in the atmosphere.” It is almost impossible to set standards that would restrict the amount of lead in the air because the metal's potentially harmful effects vary with peo ple, depending on their bodies and diet. But one thing is cer tain: The amount of lead in the atmosphere is enormous and is rapidly increasing. John G. Veneman, the Under Secretary of H.E.W., told Con gress last week: “Total emissions of lead into the nation's air are now about 200,000 tons per year up from 1:10,000 tons 10 years ago. Nearly all of it, approximately 95 per cent, results from the use of lead in gasoline.” Dr. Jesse L. Steinfek:, Sur geon General of the United States Public Health Service, testified last month that lead was responsible for “liver and kidney damage, mental retarda tion in children, and spontane ous abortions.” Excessive amounts of lead also slow the making of hemo glomin, a component of the red blood cells that carry oxygen throughout the body. Carl L. Klein, an Assistant Secretary of the Interior, also has testified that a study of women working in storage bat tery plants in Japan showed that they had a much higher than normal chance of being sterile or bearing a stillborn child. A series of experiments at the Trace Elements Laboratory at the Dartmouth Medical School have shown that the life expectancies of rats and mice given large amounts of lead were drastically shortened. “They not only die young, but they also die looking old,” said Dr. Henry A. Schroeder, who directed the experiments. The health argument against lead was summarized by Dr. Vaugn A. Newill, director of H.E.W.'s Division of Health Effects Research in Durham, N.C. “We really don't have evi dence that the levels of lead in the environment are causing medical effects,” he said. “But we are almost sure that if the amount of lead continues to increase there are going to be effects on health. Therefore, we think it a prudent argument to try to reduce the lead that is produced by auto pollution.” Emergence of Lead Why has lead, one of the cheapest, least glamorous and least noticed of metals, strd denly come into the spotlight? The answer is the vast increase in motor vehicles during the century and the need for more efficient gasolines to power them. In the early nineteen twen ties the addition of a small amount of the compound tetra ethyl lead was found to im prove significantly the perform ance of gasoline. As the American consumer demanded more powerful en gines with better acceleration, the amount of lead additives in creased so that today a gallon of leaded gasoline contains 2.5 cubic centimeters of lead corn pounds, less than a teaspoon ful. “Regular” gasolines with this amount of lead range ir, octane rating—an artificial yardstick of the amount of energy in gasoline—from 94 to 95 “Pre mium” fuels average 98 or 100 octane. The new unleaded fuels are rated at 91 octane. Some companies also are marketing, or soon will, “low lead” compounds ranging from 191 to 96 octane. These products contain half a cubic centimeter I of lead, only 20 per cent of the amount in standard leaded gaso lines. The companies making the low‐lead products contend that the small amount of lead does not contribute significantly to air pollution, while this amount raises the octane rating three, or four notches, thus making this fuel more acceptable to the public. Octane Rating of Fuels The 91 octane rating of the new unleaded fuels was deter mined to be about the lowest point at which an American automobile engine would op erate with good acceleration and performance. The engines of most new cars are designed to run efficiently on this fuel. Mr. Veneman stated last week that “if the use of lead additives is phased out in an orderly way, the increased cost to the average motorist can be held to about one cent per gallon.” Yet a spokesman in Chicago for the American Oil Company, which was the first refiner to market an unleaded gasoline, said the suggested list price fort the motorists “is three cents more than regular.” Other com panies have said they too will charge about that much more. The companies counter that the one cent a gallon figure is unrealistic because it does not take into account the costs of, capital investment that must be made in new refining equip ment, storage facilities and pumps at service stations. “I do not myself see the, justification for the price in crease; perhaps good cost fig ures are just not in,” said R. W. Hurn, a fuels expert at the De partment of the Interior's Bu reau of Mines Research Labora tory in Bartlesville, Okla. “I personally feel that the move to unleaded fuels should be approached cautiously and slowly,” he said. “I hope the public understands that ‐ the move to unleaded fuel, as well founded as it may be, simply isn't something that can let us step out tomorrow and see bright blue sky.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Health Leader Says Abortion Law Works Well Here,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/17/archives/health-leader-says-abortion-law-works-well-here.html,"After two months’ experience with the state's new abortion law—the most permissive in the country—New York City's health chief yesterday pro claimed the program a success, offering an array of encourag ing statistics to experts who had forecast heartbreaking chaos. The Health Services Adminis trator, Gordon Chase, reported that the city's public and pri vate medical facilities were Imeeting the demand for abor tions with no great strain, and) that they had a better safety record than those in other coun tries, where equally liberal laws were in effect. Since July 1, when abortions’ here became a matter solely for a woman and her physician, Mr. Chase estimated that befi tween 18,000 and 19,000 had been performed in hospitals here. He offered no guess as to the number performed in doctors’ offices. (The new law contains no prohibitions against, abortions in doctors’ offices. However, “guidelines” published by the State Medical Society and the five county medical societies here say that abortions should be limited to hospitals or hos pital‐affiliated clinics.) The official number for hos pitals, up to Sept. 4, was 15, 037. Of those, 5,038 were per formed in municipal hospitals, 5,772 in voluntary (private, non‐profit) hospitals, and 4,227 in proprietary (profit‐making) hospitals. He added 3,000 to those totals to allow for tardy reports from private hospitals. The number of women await ing abortions at public hospi tals is being maintained at “a stable and manageable level of about 2,500,” Mr. Chase said. The public hospitals are per forming more than 100 abor tions a day. Four deaths have been as sociated with abortions in hos pitals since July 1. One was of ficially attributed to an anes thesia problem; another was caused by the reaction of a rheumatic cardiac patient to the saline solution used to induce the abortion; a third patient was suffering sickle‐cell ane mia, and the fourth died from an infection, possibly caused by an attempted abortion be fore she entered the hospital. Four other women died after abortions performed elsewhere than in hospitals, then were rushed to hospitals after com plications developed. Dr. David Harris, deputy health commissioner, said that it was not known who had per formed those abortions, but that the evidence strongly in dicated that they had not been done by physicians. Those four cases are under investiga tion by the Medical Examiner's office and the Police Depart ment. Converting the city's record of the four deaths among the 18,000 hospital abortions to the form generally used by health statisticians gives a figure of 22 deaths for every 100,000 abortions. In contrast, Mr. Chase re ported, England recorded 41.4 deaths for every 100,000 abor tions in its first year, and the Scandinavian countries 39.2. Mr‐ Chase did not mention statistics for Hungary, which reported a death rate of only 1.2 deaths for every 100,000 in 1967. However, Hungary does not permit abortions after the 12th week of pregnancy unless the woman's life is in danger. New York's law allows abortions up to the 24th week, when the risk is considerably greater. Predictions that New York would be overwhelmed by out of‐state women appear to have been unfounded, Mr. Chase re ported. He estimated that one third of the abortions in New York City were performed on nonresidents. The municipal hospitals serve residents only, but officials ac knowledge that there is no fool proof way of weeding out non residents who give city addresses. Up to Sept. 4, 28 per cent of the aborted women were “non‐white” and 5 per cent were Puerto Rican, Mr. Chase said. By age group. 0.8 per cent of the women were under 15 years old; 17.4 per cent were 15 to 19. 36.0 per cent were 20 to 24; 20.6 per cent were 25 to 29; 13.4 per cent were 30 to 34, and 11.8 per cent were 35 and older. Most of the women, 62 per cent, had been pregnant less than 12 weeks; 20 per cent of the pregnancies were 12 to 15 weeks and 9 per cent were 16 to 23 weeks. Since July 1, Mr. Chase re ported, a progressively larger proportion of abortions have been performed in earlier stages of pregnancy. That ap parently reflects an initial “pent‐up demand” by women who had been pregnant for some time before the law took [effect, he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
News Summary and Index,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/17/archives/news-summary-and-index.html,"Heavy fighting between Palestinian guer rillas and the Jordanian Army began early this morning in Amman. Yesterday, King Hussein in an attempt to ease the deepen ing crisis, installed a military government and proclaimed martial law. He called on the guerrillas to lay down their arms, but the Palestinians in defiance called for a gen eral strike today. [Page 1, Col 8] In Washington, a high‐level crisis task force was reported to have met after learn ing of the King's moves and to have dis cussed possible evacuation of American citi zens. Intervention was not considered a likely possibility. [1:7.] Israeli analysts said they believed that a showdown between the Jordanian Gov ernment and the guerrillas was imminent and that Jordan's 50,000‐man army would be able to subdue both the Palestinians and the Iraqi forces stationed in Jordan in any showdown. The Israelis added that their own security was involved in the outcome, though Israeli intervention was thought un likely unless Jordan was carved up. [19:1–3.] A new representative of the International Committee of the Red Cross left for Amman to reopen negotiations for the release of the hijacked airline passengers held by a guerrilla group there. The representative's departure was viewed as a victory for Brit ain and West Germany, both of which have been pressing for renewed talks. [1:7.] The American military command in Sai gon said that nine United States helicop ters had been destroyed and eight damaged by enemy gunners in South Vietnam in the last five days. Four Americans were killed in the attacks, the command added. [1:5.] National President Nixon, speaking before an en thusiastic audience of students and faculty members in the Kansas State University Fieldhouse, appealed for the restoration of civility and an end to violence. American education is facing its “greatest crisis,” he said, because of the spread of a “cancer ous disease” of “terror” to the campuses. He asked the colleges to put their own houses in order. [1:1; Text, P. 28.] In Grand Rapids, Mich., Vice President Agnew urged blue‐collar workers to prove their patriotism by voting Republican. In a shouting match with antiwar demonstrators, he said of them: “That's exactly what we're running against…. With enemies like that, how can we lose?” [29:1.] Ford coupled an expected 5 per cent price increase for its 1971 cars with an unusual warning that the prices could be raised again if its contract with the United Automobile Workers was expensive. The union, which is negotiating a contract with the major carmakers, struck General Mo tors at midnight Monday. [1:2.] Representatives of organized labor and big business both opposed the idea of a tax on leaded gasoline as too costly in tes timony before a House committee. They said such a tax would raise the price of gasoline about three cents a gallon. [1:3–4.] The Department of Transportation called the adverse environmental effects of the proposed supersonic transport plane “insig nificant” to “trivial” in a report to the White House Council on Environmental Quality. The report, which acknowledged that “in some areas more data is neces sary,” was received with skepticism by the three members of the council. [93:1.] Metropolitan Citing the continued awarding of manage ment consultant contracts without Board of Estimate approval, Controller Abraham D. Beame ordered payment stopped on all new contracts. He said he hoped the action would provoke a lawsuit by the Mayor to resolve the contracts’ legality. [1:6.] Services in some Bronx apartment build ings not yet struck by their workers were suspended by the landlords in a “defensive shutdown,” resulting from what the Bronx Realty Advisory Board said was a “selec tive strike” against buildings owned by leaders of the board. A spokesman for the union denied any selectivity. [1:1–2.] A special lane for bicycles will probably be reserved soon on a major avenue in Man hattan during rush hours, Lindsay adminis tration officials said after joining more than 1,000 bicyclists pedaling from Central Park, to the financial district in a demonstration of bikes as a way to commute. [1:3–6.] New York's abortion program is a suc cess, the city's health chief said. With more than 18,000 abortions performed since July 1, Health Services Administrator Gordon Chase added, the death rate compared favor ably with those in northern Europe.

RULES TIGHTENED ON ABORTION HERE,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/18/archives/rules-tightened-on-abortion-here-health-board-votes-an-end-to.html,"The city's Board of Health ruled yesterday that physicians here must stop performing abortions in their private of fices by Oct. 19. The board, with one of its five members absent, voted unan imously to restrict abortions to hospitals, to hospital‐affili ated clinics, and to independent clinics that meet strict specifi cations as to professional staff operating ‐room equipment, blood banks and laboratory fa cilities. The announcement brought an angry response from groups that have fought to remove vir tually all restrictions on abor tions. “We're fighting mad, and we're going to fight this in the courts,” said Lawrence Lader, executive committee chairman of the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws. But another organization with a history of battling for abortion ‐on ‐demand, Planned Parenthood of New York City said it would be able to live with the new arrangement and even saw benefits in it. The board's decision came one day after Gordon Chase, the city's Health Services Ad ministrator, had called the abortion situation here a success. The state's new abortion law —the country's most permis sive—became effective last July 1 and there were fore casts that it would prove failure. Mr. Chase said that such predictions had been dis proved by the statistics. Dr. Mary MsLaughlin the Health Commissioner, insisted yesterday that the Board of Health—she is its chairman— had acted to prevent deaths from unprofessional proce dures. “We don't want to act as detectives who go in to investi gate after something has hap pened,” Dr. McLaughlin said. “We're interested in the pre vention of deaths and compli cations.” ‘By the Hundreds’ Yesterday's ruling was not based on statistics that would show how many abortions had been performed in doctors of fices since the liberalized law took effect. City health authori ties refuse even to guess at such a figure. The Health Code requires that a physician who performs an abortion submit a certifi cate of fetal death to the Health Department within 48 hours. Very few have done so. “From word of mouth we know abortions are being done by the hundreds in doctors of fices,” a city official said yes terday. “But how can we track them down? “Even if we did trace him [a physician], he could deny it was an abortion and tell us he'd been doing something else on her uterus.” Several health officials spec ulated yesterday that some doc tors might move from the city to the suburbs, where they could legally continue in‐office abortions. The restrictions dictated yes terday by the Board of Health generally follow “guidelines” proposed earlier by the State Medical Society, the five county medical associations in the city, and by the Health De partment's advisory committee on obstetrics and gynecology. The new state law states simply that a woman may have an abortion if she and her physician agree to it It does not say when or where the procedure must be performed, and does not require that a doctor do the operation. Leeway Is Allowed Therein lies the opposition's protest against the restrictions laid down yesterday by the city. Mr. Lader declared yester day that the Health Code amendment was contrary to the intention of the Legislature in enacting the uncomplicated law. The Board of Health—a five member unpaid panel of four physicians and one lawyer (it was Louis M. Loeb, the lawyer, embarking on a vacation by steamship, who was absent yesterday)—directed that the new restrictions take effect on Oct. 19 or earlier. They will not become law until Commissioner McLaugh lin files them with the City Clerk and they are published in the City Record. The leeway was allowed to permit doctors and clinics now performing abortions to meet new stricter standards. Requirements Listed For hospital‐affiliated clinics, the key requirement is that woman suffering complications can be rushed to a back‐up hos pital within 10 minutes. For independent clinics, the amended code will require a blood bank, a fully equipped operating room, clinical and X‐ray laboratories, and a staff of obstetricians, anesthetists, registered nurses trained in ob stetrics and the other neces sary supporting personnel. How the new regulations will affect the city's present abor tion program was unclear yes terday. Mr. Chase commented: “We do not know how many abortions now being performed in individua ldoctors’ offices will fall to the public, volun tary and private hospitals as a result of the board's action.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[1:1‐2.] Washington analysts said that their first impression was that little new and nothing promising were contained in the Paris offer.

A serious overture, they added, was more: likely to be coordinated with military offensive in Vietnam.

Canadian Review of Abortion May Yield Eased Criminal Code,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/20/archives/canadian-review-of-abortion-may-yield-eased-criminal-code.html,"OTTAWA, Sept. 19 — In response to recent shifts in public opinion, the Justice De partment has initiated a review that may lead to the removal of abortion from the criminal code. John N. Turner, Minister of Justice, has suggested more than once in recent weeks that abortion should be a purely personal and medical—and non‐criminal—matter. The criminal code permits therapeutic abortion if ap proved by a three‐doctor hospi tal committee. The maximum penalty for an illegal abortion is life imprisonment. Last spring the Government rebuffed pleas for abortion re form. Mr. Turner and Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau said that the 1969 liberaliza tion, which made a woman's health as well as her life a ground for therapeutic abor tion, should be given more, time to work. In mid‐June the Prime Minister maintained that if women were having difficulty getting abortions, the problem was with society's attitude, not with the law. He told women's liberation group to stop hammering at the Govern ment and to change public opinion. Evidence Of New Attitude Within days, probably more by coincidence than in response to his remarks, evidence began to accumulate that the Canadi an medical profession and pub lic, both commonly regarded as conservative, were shifting to a more permissive view. The Edmonton (Alberta) Journal declared editorially that “abortion concerns only one's conscience and should be a matter of personal choice only.” The Canadian Medical Association deleted a reference to abortion from its code of ethics. The association's journal proposed that doctors be re lowed into this overpopulated keepers to decide which un wanted children should be al lawed into this overpopulated world” and that moral con siderations be left entirely to the pregnant woman. The Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada decided to solicit its members’ views about “abortion on re quest.” New York State's new, liberal law presumably has contributed to a general shift among Cana dian women toward the view that a woman should be able to get an abortion if she wants one.. Statistics Being Compiled The Trudeau Government has not embraced that proposition but change seems to be com ing. A few weeks ago the Justice Department asked the Dominion Bureau of Statistics to compile data on the number of abortion requests and the number performed. Mr. Trudeau sponsored a similar view with respect to I homosexual relations between consenting adults, which 1968, amendments legalized. Repeal of the sanction, in Mr. Turner's view, would not mean that the Government an proved of abortion but that it took a neutral position. According to political sources, further liberalization will certainly meet resistance in the Cabinet and the Liberal party caucus, Quebec, still a heavily Roman Catholic, rural, conservative region, accounts for 56 of the party's 153 seats in the House of Commons. Mr. Trudeau might choose to defer abortion legislation until after the next election, presumably to be held in late 1971 or 1972.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hormone‐Like Chemicals Seen As Ideal Birth Control Method,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/20/archives/hormonelike-chemicals-seen-as-ideal-birth-control-method.html,"About 500 scientists from around the world gathered here last week to discuss a mysteri ous group of naturally occur ring, hormone‐like substances that may give mankind the con traceptive it has been waiting for—a safe, effective, inexpen sive, once‐a‐month, morning after means of fertility control. The substances, known as Prostaglandins, may also pro vide a safe and simple chemical means of producing abortion early in pregnancy. Prostaglandins were discov ered 40 years ago, but only in the last few years has their wide range of activity begun to be elucidated. They have al ready been tested in hundreds of women as agents that induce labor, produce abortion and provide contraception after fer tilization has occurred. But scientists at the meeting and the dozen or more drug companies sponsoring studies of prostaglandins believe the therapeutic usefulness of these substances will eventually go far beyond the reproductive system into such diverse areas as control of blood pressure, prevention and treatment of gastric ulcers and blood clots, and treatment of male infertil ity, asthma and nasal conges tion. Other Uses Cited Dr. John E. Pike of the Up john Company in Kalamazoo, Mich., likened their potential to that of the steroids, which have resulted in oral contraceptives and a wide range of drugs for the treat ment of such illnesses as asthma and arthritis. “Prostaglandins have some uncanny similarities to the steroids,” Dr. Pike said at a news conference held in con junction with the three‐day meeting, which was sponsored by the New York Academy of Sciences. Dr. Pike's company is supporting clinical studies here of the use of prosta glandins for the induction of labor and abortion. Prostaglandins, found in tiny amounts in cells throughout the body, are fatty chemicals that seem to modify the metabollic activity of cells. Some researchers believe they act as intracellular translators of chemical messages that cells receive from body fluids. Prostaglandins are thought to act as enhancers or suppressors of messages carried by such chemicals as hormones. Prostaglandins are not truly hormones, however, since they do no fit the definition of a hormone, which refers to a substance produced in one part of the body and carried by the bloodstream to act on some other part. Prostaglandins are found in greatest amounts in the seminal fluid of sheep and man, and in lesser amounts in the uterus, lungs, brain, thymus, pancreas and kidneys. Fourteen kinds of prostaglandins have thus far been identified, but most re searchers in the field believe that many more still await dis covery. They are designated by an elaborate system of nomenclature that is borrowed from Greek and Roman alpha bets and from the number system. Effect on Uterus The prostaglandins that ap pear to be most promising in regulating the reproductive sys tem are referred to as PGE2 and PGF2a (prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin Fla. Accord ing to the report at the meet ing, these substances exert their greatest effect on the smooth muscles of the uterus, causing them to contract. Thus, physicians from Uganda and Sweden said they had suc cessfully used PGE2 and PGF2a, given intravenously or orally, to stimulate the onset of labor in women whose pregnancies had gone up to or beyond term But the most exciting pros pect for prostaglandins, ac cording to Dr. Reimert Raven holt of the Office of Popula tion in the Agency for Inter national Development, is in birth control. Dr. Ravenholt, citing studies in Sweden among 30 women who are using prostaglandins as their only means of birth control, said that “something has finally come along that is very close to a nontoxic, self administerable, completely ef fective, once‐a‐month contra ceptive that can be used with the practice of hindsight.” In the Swedish studies, the women are given infusions of prostaglandin only if their menstruial periods are delayed by more than two days and they have positive pregnancy tests. Prostaglandin success fully brought on a menstrual period in all four women who have been treated thus far. Although it will probably take several years before a prosta glandin contraceptive can be marketed here, Dr. Ravenholt said that, if all continued to go well, it should prove an ex tremely useful morning‐after contraceptive throughout the world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That Equal‐Rights Amendment‐ What, Exactly, Does It Mean?",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/20/archives/that-equalrights-amendmentwhat-exactly-does-it-mean-the-equalrights.html,"WASHINGTON. The great question that has never been answered, and which I have not yet been able to answer de spite my 30 years of research into the feminine soul, is: What does a woman want? —SIGMUND FREUD LAST month, the United States House of Rep resentatives, in one of its irregular fits of conscience or regular fits of opportunism, voted 346 to 15 for an amendment designed to give women equal rights, just in case they don't already have them. This month the Senate will be asked to follow the House. With 81 of the 100 Senators co‐signing the bill, odds are that it will soon be on its way to the state legislatures, and if three fourths of them ratify it, the Constitution will be patched for the 26th time. What a very strange job of legislating it has Ordinarily the work of Congress is done in commit tee, where staff members have time to research important issues and both sides are given a chance to call expert witnesses. The House held no hearings on this amendment, which was rushed to a vote after only one hour of floor debate. Proponents got 45 minutes and opponents 15. That, needless to say, isn't much time, but considering their prepara tion, it would have been embarrassing for either side to have had more. The Senate is in little better shape. Its last flurry of interest was in the early nineteen‐fifties—before most of the current Senators were elected, much less familiar with the problem. In the last four months, Judiciary Committee members have thrown together a total of six days of hearings distinguished by such insights as this from Gloria Steinem, the writer and thinker: “Penis envy is clinically disappearing. Just as black people envied white skins, 19th‐century women envied penises.” The Senators were left to do with that what they could. Whatever else can be said of it, the equal‐rights amendment's journey down the corridors of Con has‐so far been an impressive demonstration The equal‐rights case shows what can be done in “almost total ignorance” of what can be achieved through almost total ignorance. No one in Congress can make even a reasonably good guess as to the amendment's probable effect on laws covering such matters as wife support, child support, military conscription and property division. According to the American Law Division of the Library of Congress, “no definitive legal anal ysis has ever been made” to find out what effects such an amendment would have. “EQUALITY of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.” That's how the House amendment reads. It sounds simple, but what does it mean? Proponents of the amendment say it means women will have as much chance as men for fun, travel and adventure in the armed services. But when it gets right down to the pinch, they begin to wobble. The chairman of the Woman's party, Mrs. Marjorie Longwell, a cheerful, grandmotherly Californian, was asked if she really wanted her sex to be subject to mili tary conscription. “Why, certainly, she replied. “If I were between the ages of 18 and 26 I'd be ashamed if I weren't willing to fight for my coun try against the Communists.” Did she mean that women should actually be drafted for the front lines? “Well,” she said, “I don't think any lady would want to shoot an other lady's son.” Proponents of the amendment say it will mean that laws prohibiting women from being bartenders, min ers, bellhops and truck drivers will be declared unconstitutional—permit ting the ladies to upgrade themselves through those jobs—as will laws that impose minimum wages, maximum hours and maximum weight ‐lifting requirements on women workers in some states. They say women want to be free of this protective legis lation. But they might appreciate a few exceptions. Says Congresswoman Catherine May, a supporter of the bill: “No one questions special laws for veterans or for the blind or for various segments of our society. It would certainly not be inconsistent to still have special laws for mothers or mothers‐to‐be.” This kind of talk is beside the point, as the proponents will generally admit if you talk to them long enough. Vigorous action on the part of the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission in obtaining compliance with Title VII (no sex discrimination in jobs) of the Civil Rights Act has outlawed restrictive job statutes in many states, and the rest seem ready to follow suit shortly—prodded by Federal Court decisions. Amendment or no amendment, the military is not likely to move much further than it has already; the Navy recently bowed to a court ruling that to discharge a pregnant unmarried Wave would be unfairly discrimina tory since the Navy does not dis charge unmarried impregnators. As for the likelihood of front‐line combat for women, every serious advocate of the equal‐rights amendment con cedes that the Federal judiciary is not likely to interpret any law in such a way that it does not coincide with what the armed forces indicate are their personnel needs. So that's all rhetoric. The proponents can hardly be accused of hard‐sell reasoning. Says Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm of New York: “The direct economic effects of the amendment would be minor. Social and psychological ef fects will be initially more impor tant than legal or economic results.” Senator Eugene McCarthy, the chief sponsor of the amendment on his side of the Capitol, agrees with Mrs. Chis holm that the major blessings would come, if at all, with the long ‐term erosion of old social attitudes. “It won't have a revolutionary effect,” he says. “It will just put pressure on state legislatures and on courts in some cases, and I think also on extra‐governmental activities—corpo rations, big insurance companies and so on—all those places where there is discrimination which can't be ex plained in any terms except sex—the essence of sex, not a state of life or professional training or whether you are strong or weak.” Congresswoman Martha Griffiths of Detroit, the mastermind of the strategy that whisked the legislation through the House, also says that the main thing she is shooting for is psy chological uplift. Indeed, she adds, the “1964 Civil Rights Act granted far more rights to women and other minorities than this amendment ever dreamed of.” Pressed to think up possible benefits other than the psy chological, she discloses that one of her main reasons for pushing the amendment is preventative: “It will mean that you cannot go backward. Oh yes, we could go backward— Germany did, you know. If this is enacted into law and you started to go backward, started to have dis criminatory laws against women, then the Supreme Court would have to stop it. Didn't Hitler come along and say, ‘Every woman into the kitchen'? In the Depression, one of the standard regulations of school boards through out the country was that a married woman couldn't teach school. This morning, unemployment in Michigan is 9.1 per cent, so we are always running this risk, and the real free dom in any country, as the Supreme Court said in 1915, is the right to make a living at the occupation of your choice.” Opponents, on the other hand, argue that the imagined hardships that could befall women without the amendment under a dictator or in a major depression are few indeed, compared to the damages that will result from the amendment in normal times. Paul Freund, a Harvard pro fessor of law who has been among the most outspoken foes of the equal rights proposal for a quarter century, warns: “It will open a pandora's box of legal complications. The amend ment expresses noble sentiments, but I'm afraid it will work much mischief in actual application. Once you open the door, where will it lead? Boston has a Girls’ Latin School and a Boys’ Latin School. They are very presti gious, and the city is proud of them. Would this amendment force them to blend?” Some legal scholars believe the measure would breed “endless litigation,” in the words of Soia Mentschikoff, a University of Chicago law professor. Even Senator Birch Bayh, a stubborn backer of the amendment, agrees in part: “The women are un derestimating the size of the job. It may not have to be pursued through the courts case by case, but I think it will be by each class of dis crimination.” The same fear has been expressed since the amendment was bouncing around the United States Sen ate in the early fifties. At that time a dozen such legal pashas as Roscoe Pound and Charles Warren signed a statement predicting that the amend ment would force “every pro vision of law concerning wo men” down the long, long trail to the U.S. Supreme Court. “It is difficult if not impbs sible to compress all the rela tionships of men and women into one brief formula, one motto or slogan, like this amendment,” says Freund. “Some will argue, ‘Well, we worked it out for the blacks, so let's follow that formula for women, too.’ It isn't that simple. Jail cells can no longer be segregated along racial lines. Does this mean we would no longer be able to segregate jail cells along sex lines?” Shortly before the House acted, Rita E. Hauser, U.S. representative to the United Nations, told an American Bar Association gathering that the amendment might kill state laws banning marriages between homosexuals. Her statement was immediately denounced by Congressman Clement Zablocki of Wiscon sin as “an example of the moral rot infecting the na tion,” but in fact she was theorizing no more wildly than have a number of law school professors, Freund in cluded. Senator Sam Ervin of North Carolina, who is sometimes considered a constitutional authority, at least by Senate standards, adds other spooks to the line‐up: “This would absolutely destroy the law in every state which makes it the primary duty of the hus band to support the wife and children. For a person to have a right, it means somebody else must have a correspond ing legal duty. To say the right of man and woman, hus band and wife, should be equal in respect to who's go ing to support the other that destroys any responsi bility on either one of them's part, and consequently neither one of them has any right. “This amendment would de stroy all state alimony laws and all child‐custody laws. In addition to that, we have laws requiring separate rest rooms for boys and girls in public schools. These would be annulled.” And what about rape? Mrs. Griffiths assured the House: “This law does not apply to criminal acts capable of com mission by only one sex. It does not have anything to do with the law of rape or pros titution. You are not going to have to change those laws.” That's not the way Senator Ervin understands either biol ogy or the statutes of his home state, which he says are much like the laws in every state. North Carolina law decrees that anybody convicted of raping a “female of the age of 12 or more” or sexually abusing “any female child” under 12 should be executed. Ervin is fairly certain that if the equal‐rights amendment passes, a man convicted under that statute could justifiably appeal on the grounds of dis crimination. But, says Ervin, that does not end this line of complexities because at pres ent an adult male who lives with a 14‐year‐old girl can be convicted of statutory rape while an adult female found in a similar love nest with a boy would be convicted only of contributing to the delin quency of a minor. In which direction does one correctly equalize, if it can be done at all? Besides, say Ervin and the others, this amendment is useless because it does noth ing but repeat the essence of the 14th Amendment's equal protection guarantees. You get the idea. Every thing is up in the air. At this point neither side really knows what it is talking about because, as a February release of the Labor De partment's Women's Bureau acknowledged, “There are a great many questions con cerning the equal ‐rights amendment, but very few answers.” HAVING failed to canvass the 50 state attorneys general for their opinions and having failed in every other way to balance the good or evil that will come from the new law, why did the House act with such flashy abandon? Ervin makes one guess that some others share: “I wouldn't say it's happening because Congressmen are frightened exactly, but I would say that they are fidgety. If we need any new constitutional amendment, it would be to ban Congress from passing any legislation in election years.” A Congressman who under standably asks anonymity ex plains his own uneasiness: “The amendment is of no great concern to me, one way or the other. But what you're dealing with here is some women with time on their hands, and nothing can be more dangerous than an idle woman. She loves a cause. She loves to ring doorbells. She loves to get on the tele phone. And I don't want that kind of woman working against me.” This may be mainly an im agined threat, but the advo cates of the amendment nat urally encouraged Congres sional belief in it. After Repre sentative Florence Dwyer of New Jersey acknowledged in a speech to the House that “the women of America are not beating on the doors of Con gress demanding passage of the equal‐rights amendment,” she warned: “But do not be misled. Women are as sensi tive to their rights as men, and I cannot imagine that American women will wel come being repudiated by Congress.” Later, the warn ing was spelled out more clearly by Mrs. Lucille Shliver, national director of the Business and Professional Women. “If this amendment is defeated,” she said, “we would cooperate with other major women's groups in try ing to get rid of those Con gressmen who fought us. That's where we would direct our campaign this fall.” But she conceded that she really didn't know how much clout the women's groups would The source of the Congres sional fidgets is obvious—the Women's Liberation move ment. Until recently, the Con gressional concept of “mili tant women” was shaped by such things as the annual gathering of ex‐suffragettes around the statue of Susan B. Anthony in the basement of the Capitol on that gallant lady's birthday. Otherwise the almost quiescent feminist movement came to the legislators’ attention only through small delegations from polite women's organ izations who continued to prowl the Senate and House office buildings over the years, lobbying for more rights and being received like Puerto Ricans who want independence. To be sure, every year at least 100 or so Congressmen popped women's rights bills into the hopper, but this per functory gesture was easily forgotten. In the last couple of years the legislators had become vaguely aware of guerrilla fighting in more bar barous parts of the nation, such as New York City, where amid the smoke of burning brassieres and shrill cries for free abortions, the clash of armies was heard by night; but all that, our Congressmen were confident, would never reach their doors. To them, the movement was still centered in the old Woman's party, which main tained its headquarters in the Belmont House, two blocks away, through the gracious ness of Senators who have not yet torn the place down to extend a parking lot. Then came the Lib move ment, which even Mrs. Long well, the party chairman, ad mitted “has helped rather than hindered us, though they have done some rather em barrassing things like—well, you know what they've done —burn those things.” That's putting it mildly. The Libera tion movement absolutely ig nited the old Establishment outfits like Business and Pro fessional Women, and they in turn began to put the heat on Congress as never before. Suddenly it was difficult to find a member of either house of Congress who didn't think that NOW (the National Or ganization for Women) meant him and right now, and never mind the deliberation. FOR 47 years, ever since the ratification of the 19th Amendment gave women the right to vote, militant femi nists have been trying to write into the Constitution something that would force the courts to recognize all their rights as being on a par with men's. The hangup was not in the Senate, which has passed the amendment three times in the last 20 years, though not in a version that was satisfactory to the women. The hangup was in the House; to be precise, in the Judiciary Committee, which for 23 years has been ruled by white‐haired Eman uel Celler of New York, a foe not only of all efforts to legislate female rights but also, on at least two occa sions, of proposals to write them into the national Demo cratic platform. Every year for 23 years somebody in the House intro duced an equal‐rights reso lution, which automatically went to Celler's committee for burial without ceremony. Since 1959, Congresswoman Griffiths had been one of those who engaged in the futility. “I never went to Mr. Celler formally and requested that he hold hearings, but I would see him in the hall and bring up the matter. He would just laugh.” Then came the spring of 1970, and Con gresswoman Griffiths began to notice a new stirring among her colleagues. Instead of the usual 100 to 150 pro forma introductions of equal‐rights amendments, the count began to climb toward and then past 200. At that point, she started thinking crafty thoughts about bypassing Celler with a dis charge petition. It is a hard trick to pull off, and espe cially hard to do in the com mittee controlled by the House's dean. In the past 60 years7 825 discharge peti tions have been filed to free legislation from committee bottlenecks, but only 34 re ceived enough signatures. Of these, only 15 passed the House. On June 11 (noticing by then that an amazing 254 similar resolutions for wom en's rights had been intro duced by other members), an undaunted Mrs. Griffiths filed her petition for discharge, fearing only that “If I filed it and failed, I would be giving the Supreme Court aid and comfort. The Supreme Court could have made this whole thing unnecessary 100 years ago. If I couldn't get enough signatures on the dis charge petition, would I hurt my cause? I was risking an awful lot, and I knew how much.” Six days later, she sent out a “Dear Colleague” letter to all members, asking their support. She got it over whelmingly. There is ordi narily a fatal ebb and flow in discharge‐petition signa tures. The first 150 come easy; but once the movement goes much beyond that, many of the first signers, who didn't really mean it, begin to withdraw their names. With Mrs. Griffiths's petition, it was just the opposite: Once past the 150 mark the sign ing picked up, and not one signer removed his name. To measure the full size of Mrs. Griffiths's victory, one must also consider that among the signers were 12 commit tee chairmen, who never openly turn on a brother chairman except under the most unusual pressures. It did not exactly hurt her cause that Wilbur Mills, Chairman of Ways and Means and pos sibly the most powerful man in the House, helped solicit names for the petition, ar did Charles Vanick of Ohio, James Byrne of Pennsylvania and, according to Mrs. Grif fiths, “all the California dele gation.” She says Republican Leader Gerald Ford “supplied some real moxie, too: He lined up 15 or 16 names right at the end.” Mrs. Griffiths was also busy elsewhere. “The minute I filed the discharge petition,” she says, “I began getting wom en's organizations involved. They responded immediately with an avalanche of letters to Congress. The Business and Professional Women were tremendously helpful. Right at the end of the filing, they were having a convention in Hawaii, and it was announced every day how many new names had been added. NOW was especially helpful. Also, I went out and talked to all the state presidents at an Ameri can Association of University Women convention.” The letters arrived in such quantities that some Con gressmen asked Mrs. Griffiths to “call off the women” (at any rate, that's what her staff says). One Congressman got so much mail that he was forced to answer by Robo type—a kind of mass produc tion that House members rarely have to resort to for “issue” mail. One should un derstand, however, that Con gressmen scare rather easily. Fifty letters a day on one subject is enough to convince almost any Congressman—if he is ready to be convinced —that he is hearing the thun derous, unified vox populi. Exactly one month after Mrs. Griffiths launched her juggernaut, Celler surren dered—announcing that he would hold hearings on the amendment—but by this time Mrs. Griffiths, apparently feel ing that she deserved some vengeance after all the years of waiting, did not want to stop. And so, on Aug. 10, the House heard the debate. It often resembled some thing picked up in pieces from the floor of the M.G.M. cutting room. Mrs. Griffiths pleaded that all she wanted was to lift women to the level of equality to which the Supreme Court had long ago raised a Chinese laundryman, an alien Japanese fisherman and an alien Austrian cook (referring to three court cases, none more recent than 1948, the oldest going back to 1886). Congressman Ford said that, judging from the years of delay in passing the amendment: “You would al most think there had been a conspiracy.” Against insinu ations that women are less stable than men, Congress man John Anderson of Illinois inserted in the record his courtly irritation: “I found it disturbingly ironic that in a nation which put three men on the moon, we should some how be concerned with the mental aberrations of women because of the so‐called lunar And it went. SOME prominent women's organizations — the National Council of Jewish Women, the National Council of Negro Women and the National Council of Catholic Women, for example—are actively op posing passage of the amend ment. The United Auto Work ers favor it, but several pow erful A.F.L.‐C.I.O. unions, in cluding the Communications Workers of America and the Amalgamated Clothing Work ers, oppose it. Of notable in dividual opponents, Mrs. Leon Keyserling, former head of the Women's Bureau, is typi cal. She buttresses her posi tion by quoting Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt, who opposed a spe cial amendment because she believed the Constitution as it stood gave women equal rights. But most of the 72 million American women over the age of 16 do not take sides; they respond to the Congressional debate with an interest that equals the enthusiasm Spiro Agnew might be expected to show at a hairdressers’ con vention. The excitement of the cru sade is generated by a leader ship representing probably less than 2 per cent of women. The power behind the drive is supplied by profes sional elitists, women who can afford the luxury of cru sades. Whom do they speak for except others at their level? This was the ques tion put to Bayh's Constitu tional Amendments subcom mittee by Myra Wolfgang, vice president of the Hotel and Restaurant Employes and Bartenders International Un ion. She was furious that the militant feminists were pro posing an end to all protec tive labor laws for women. “My concern,” she told Bayh, “is for the widowed, divorced mother of children who is the head of her family and earns less than $3,500 a year for working as a maid, laun dry worker, hospital cleaner or dishwasher. There are mil lions of such women. Only one out of ten women in the work force has had four or more years of college. The rights of women who are un able to work excessive over time, who are not covered by the equal‐employment‐oppor tunities provision of the civil rights act and who consider overtime a punishment, not a privilege, must also be protected. The equal‐rights amendment will make it im possible to do so.” Until this year, the com missions appointed by every President of the sixties had recommended working through the Supreme Court with test cases to expand the coverage of the 14th Amend ment rather than seeking an other amendment. President Kennedy's Commission on the Status of Women was made up of a broad spectrum of interests, including wage earners. Its successor, the present Citizens’ Advisory Council on the Status of Women, picked by Nixon, is made up solidly of Establish ment types, women who have been so successful that one may understandably wonder what they are complaining about: the president of a gas pipeline company, an execu tive of a petroleum corpora tion, the vice president of a dairy and ice‐cream company, a newspaper publisher, a cou ple of university professors, three attorneys, the vice pres ident of a drug‐store chain and several who are identi fied only as “civic leaders.” There isn't a working stiff or a representative of working stiffs in the bunch. The Nixon‐appointed Task Force on Women's Rights and Responsibilities, which re ported back this year in an gry tones, Is broader in its make‐up, but it is domi nated by college presidents, telephone‐company executives and attorneys. Yet both groups are far more militant and far less re sponsive to Presidential whim than the women Kennedy picked. An executive in the Department of Labor's Wom en's Bureau who worked closely with these groups tells why: “The movement picked up tremendous steam when Presi dent Nixon came in and didn't do the things he prom ised. The women really got mad. A lot of Republican Es tablishment women are real leaders in this. Most of the women on the Presidential task force have been state Re publican committeewomen or on committees for Nixon and Agnew. The Citizens’ Advi sory Council is also a very political outfit. But the White House has been completely intransigent—please don't use my name—and that intransi gence has built up anger and support for the amendment. The Johnson Administration knew they had a problem. They were much more sensi tive politically. They gave just enough to keep women from really getting uptight. When the Republicans came in, they didn't know they had a prob lem; they wouldn't even ap prove a bill to extend equal pay to executive and professional administrative women. That kind of thing gets around, and it made women so damned mad they wanted to do something.” ONE of the things they did was turn out sometimes inaccurate poop sheets. Prob ably the most persuasive of these, since it had little com petition, was the 18‐page memorandum put out in March by the Citizens’ Ad visory Council. A copy wound up in just about every Con gressional office and served as the basis for a number of the speeches given in the de bate. Not that the women propagandists can be blamed entirely for what was said in the House; much of it was also the result of sloppy Congressional staff work and the customary failure of members to do their home work. It might all be chalked up as no more important than just another day of orations, but in this case it is more than that. If the sex amend ment is eventually ratified, the Federal courts will have to interpret the law accord ing to “Congressional intent,” and to do this they will have to be guided at least in part by the statements made in the House on Aug. 10. Some guidance that was. Mrs. Griffiths, for example, emphasized in offering her resolution that it would “re strict only governmental ac tion, and would not apply to purely private action.” Among other things, she said, it would shape laws affecting government employment, but it would have no direct bear ing on private policies, as the 1964 Civil Rights Act did. The 1964 measure, she insisted, “applies against private indus try. This amendment applies only against government.” That's clear enough, yet along comes Minority Leader Ford a few minutes later to tell the House: “This amend ment will give [women] those most valued of rights—the rights to a job, to a promo tion, to a pension... to all the fringe benefits of any job.” Such bungling male help was not appreciated. An ex ecutive of the Women's Bu reau said: “One of our biggest problems is that people don't know what they're talking about, but I understand from people who are up on the Hill a lot that this is generally true, and it makes me sick. Ford is absolutely wrong. The only employment situation— hiring and promotion — the amendment will have any ef fect on is public employment. It would affect Federal and state government jobs and school teachers.” For another example, Mrs. Griffiths assured the House that “for 26 years both par ties in their political conven tions have endorsed it; the Republican party has en dorsed it for 30 years.” Sorry, that's wrong. In recent con ventions the Issue has been treated as no longer pertinent. Researchers at Republican Na tional Headquarters say that as late as 1956 the party's platform contained a plank urging Congress to pass an equal‐rights amendment for men and women, but in 1960 it was cut down to an amend ment for women alone and the 1964 and 1968 G.O.P. platforms dropped all men tion of it. Officials at Demo cratic National Headquarters acknowledged without appar ent guilt that their '64 and ‘68 platforms also ignored the issue. One of the claims made by the Citizens’ Advisory Coun cil and repeated in the House was that state colleges and universities, either by law or practice, discriminate against women applicants. The coun cil gives no supporting data. I called Dr. Todd Furniss, di rector of the American Coun cil on Education's Office of Academic Affairs, and asked about such discrimination. “I personally certainly don't know of any,” he said. “I doubt that it exists. So far as practices are concerned, the only kind of controls that would exclude women would be availability of dormitories —sort of a controlled exclu sion—but that's a pretty thin thread to hold up a discrimi nation complaint. Last spring my daughter, who will be applying for college this year, got a lot of flak from seniors in her school about being turned down by colleges. I suggested she do a paper on it. But it turned out to be a very complicated thing, and the discrimination picture just didn't come together. I've had some complaints from profes sional schools where women felt they had been turned down. But apparently what they had run into was some tough, realistic advice: ‘This profession is a hard one for women. It's traditionally a man's profession and you will run into walls. ’ That sort of thing. They interpreted the advice as refusal.” One of the legislators who argued that college and uni versity registrars turn away women in arbitrary waves was Mrs. Edith Green, Ore gon's influential voice on the House Education Committee. Mrs. Green. told the House: “I am advised that last year in Virginia 21,000 girl appli cants for college were re jected. Not one single boy was rejected.” Pretty impressive statistics. I called Dr. Daniel Marvin, associate director of the Vir ginia Council of Higher Edu cation, to verify them. “In the fall of 1969,” he said, “of the 29,708 male fresh men who applied to all state colleges and universities, 22, 410 were accepted. The state schools received 22,234 appli cations from girls, and 16,567 were accepted. In other words, about 75 per cent of the men were accepted and about 75 per cent of the women were accepted. They have been ac cepted at that rate, for several years.” How had Mrs. Green been so misinformed? “I really can't explain it,” she said, being too kind to accuse a staff member of stupidity; the statistical information she used had come from a six‐year‐old report of the Virginia Commission of Education. One of the favorite out rages of pro‐amendment Con gressmen is that some state laws require heavier penalties for females than for males convicted of the same crime. Congresswoman Shirley Chis holm was so smitten by that alleged injustice that she men tioned it twice in the same speech, apparently borrowing the information from the Citi zen's Advisory Council's memorandum. The Presiden tial Task Force also repeats it. IS there any factual basis for the claim? One of the Congressmen who used the charge in floor debate was Paul Findley of Illinois. I asked his administrative aide, Robert Wichser, what states and what laws Findley was talking about. Wichser said, “I think it's prostitution, but where, I don't know. My wife wrote that speech. I'll ask her and call you back.” He did; prostitution, it turned out, was not the crime. Neither he nor his wife nor Findley knew what crimes were in volved; as for the states, they had been refer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ing to Penn sylvania and Connecticut—but both states had repealed the offending laws two years ago. Wichser said one state, Ar kansas, still discriminates against women by sending them to prison for as long as three years for dope addic tion and drunkenness, where as men cannot be imprisoned as users. But he admitted that this isolated example from one of the most backward states hardly adds up to a national pattern. Even the Arkansas Commission of Cor rections acknowledges the un constitutionality of the law and is encouraging a test case. But that is not the way the Congressional Record reads on this point. Since Findley had been guided by the Citizens’ Ad visory Council's memoran dum, I telephoned Miss Sarah Jane Cunningham, chairman of the council's study group, which supervised the writing of the propaganda booklet. Miss Cunningham practices law in McCook, Neb. Our con versation will indicate the kind of scholarship that went into the sex amendment: Q. Miss Cunningham, where do they give women stiffer jail sentences than men for the same crime? A. As I recall, the biggest offender was Pennsylvania. Q. But they've changed that law, haven't they? A. I couldn't tell you. So much for the chairman. She recommended that I talk to Mary Eastwood because “the report was actually com piled back there.” So the question was put to Miss East wood, a lawyer for the Justice Department who was bor rowed by the Women's Bu reau for 20 hours, she says, to write the booklet. Her an swer: “Pennsylvania and Con necticut used to. I think there are still some other states, but I don't know which ones.” So much for the technical expert. When the Supreme Court gets around to reading the record, it will find Congress men arguing that one of the principal examples of sex discrimination is shown in “dual pay schedules for men and women public‐school teachers.” That's right out of the memorandum, too, so I asked the chairman of the council's study group, Miss Cunningham, to name the states that have double pay standards. She said: “I think you'd find it in nearly every state, so far as I know.” The council's legal expert, Miss Eastwood, said: “I understand it's quite common. I know it's still in use in the state of Wisconsin because I have friends who teach school there. They haye a separate pay schedule for women than for men, on the theory that men have families to support. But you'd better double‐check that. Ask the N.E.A.” I did. The National Educa tion Association's spokesman told quite a different story: “In the 1968‐1969 school year, we found that only five out of the nation's 1,200 school systems surveyed—and these would be the larger sys tems—had dual pay sched ules. That's such a small per centage we didn't even bother to resurvey last year. As I recall, the dual pay schedules tended to be in Kansas and Wisconsin.” Dr. C. T. Whittier, Kansas Commissioner of Education, responded, “That has all been cleared up.” And William Kahi, Wisconsin School Super intendent, said: “I've been in the state department 20 years, and I can't recall a dual pay schedule ever being the state policy. There might have been scattered situations where the school boards negotiated in dividual contracts with teach ers, but for the past five years the rule has been col lective bargaining with men and women getting equal pay for the same work.” There were some rather yeasty lumps of demagogy on both sides of debate. Poor old Celler, failing to equip himself with much factual opposition to the amendment, cranked out wisecracks like, “There's as much difference between men and women as between horse chestnuts and chestnut horses.” Matching that on the proponents’ side was Congressman Roman Pucinski's plea that to refuse the amendment would be yet another smudge on the na tion's record. “It is a sad mark in our history,” he com plained, “that the United States was the last of the so called enlightened govern ments in the world to recog nize women as human beings fully entitled to partici pate in electing officials to public office.” As a matter of fact, while Australia had preceded us by 18 years and New Zealand by 27, the United States gave the full vote to women eight years before Britain took that step. France didn't get around to it until 1946, Italy not until 1947, and a number of other major countries that Pucinski might not consider “enlightened” (China and Japan, for instance) also withheld the vote from their women until after World War II. Switzerland, the only Cen tral European country to avoid participation in any modem wars, still does not permit its women to vote. (It is possible, of course, that there is no connection.) TAKING it all In all, it was a remarkable hour in the life of Congress. And the legisla tive history written during that time, under the guidance of Congresswoman Griffiths and the Citizens’ Advisory Council and Presidential Task Force, gives ample proof that when it comes to preparing jerry‐built debate, women are indeed the equal of men. A word should also be said to the credit of Mrs. Griffiths as a floor tactician. She was superb. Knowing that the liberals in the House were al most obliged to go along with any amendment sounding so helpful as this one, her open ing remarks were apparently aimed at nailing down the conservative votes, especially those from the South. That region and Mrs. Griffiths had accidentally worked well to gether once before, though not for the same purpose, in inserting the sex antidiscrim ination wording of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The South erners had pushed it partly as a joke and partly as a diversionary tactic, but they had been momentarily useful nonetheless. Now Mrs. Grif fiths was ready to use her strange allies again. What arm of Government is most detested by Southern Congressmen? Exactly. So Mrs. Griffiths, within the first minute, drew the lines accord ingly. “It is time,” she said, “that in this battle with the Supreme Court, that this body and the legislatures of the states come to the aid of wo men by passing this amend ment.” And lest any of the allies she sought were still asleep, as was unlikely, she elaborated: “We will show you that the Supreme Court, which has readily moved to change the boundaries of your school district, has not on one single occasion granted to women the basic protection of the 5th and 14th Amend ments.” Right in on cue came some of the rowdies of the old civil‐rights fight, such men as Albert Watson of South Caro lina, needling Celler for help ing blacks but not women and sonorously calling for passage of the amendment as tribute due the “pioneering spirit” of American women, “the backbone of the Ameri can family” to whom “the nation owes its very life.” Next stop, the Senate. From that chamber we will doubt less once again hear of well documented injustices. Gerald Ford told the House, “Men are not generally speak ing antiwomen, it simply ap pears to work out that way.” It sure does. Whether in private or public employment, women get shorted. Women who spend four years in col lege may hope, on the aver age, to earn about $1,200 a year less than men who quit after high school. Women have little trouble getting jobs in the Federal Government as secretaries, but above that level their difficulties begin. They hold 30 per cent of the jobs with a beginning salary of $6,548, but up at the pro gram‐management level, where pay is around $15,0, they hold only 6.9 per cent of the positions. Women fill less than 1 per cent of the top career jobs paying $35,000. Civil service officials insist that antiquated masculine attitudes account for only a fraction of the fall‐off; often, they say, women prefer to drop out for marriage or to raise families rather than to stay around for promotions. But the statistics clearly indi cate that, even with a new constitutional amendment for leverage, women would have trouble dislodging official deadweight resistance. The attitude creating this situation begins at the top. Every President since Frank lin Delano Roosevelt has talked a good line, but only twice were they moved to ap point women to their Cabi nets: Frances Perkins, Secre tary of Labor under F.D.R., and Oveta Culp Hobby, Sec retary of Health, Education and Welfare under Eisen hower. ONCE beyond statistics like that, the Senate will doubtless plunge into guess work. But one pleasant change awaits the observer in the upper chamber: A member who is candid about his own ignorance and who is willing to assign the same character istics to his colleagues, though it violates protocol. “Frankly,” said Ervin short ly before the Senate Judiciary Committee's hearings opened 10 days ago, “I'm not sup posed, as a Senator, to say anything derogatory about the House, but I doubt if anybody except the chief proponent of the bill gave more than 15 minutes’ study and research to this business before they voted. And when we hold our hearings I'm not going to be as prepared as I would like. To tell you the truth, I never expected this thing to ever come up, and consequently didn't make any preparation to fight it. I was astounded when the thing passed the House. “This is a tremendous thing. I've written to the attorneys general of all the states asking what the amend ment will do to their laws, but I won't have many of the answers by then. I won't be able to offer a national view of what this will do to our laws. All I can do is hit the high spots of a few states and point out a few things—like, if the amendment becomes law we'll either have to close down West Point, Annapolis and the Air Force Academy or convert them into co educational war colleges. Someone told me that the Attorney General of Arizona said that if the House‐passed amendment becomes law, his state would have to rewrite its Constitution, and it would take 10 years of litigation to to find out what in the devil this thing meant. I agree with that.” Of Ervin, Mrs. Griffiths said: “I trust that he goes down to a graceful and gra cious defeat.” Well, in some ways Ervin is a very gracious fellow, but at present he shows it best in the way he cuts down women lobbyists. He enjoys it. “I had two very charming ladies in my office the other day,” he says, “try ing to persuade me to with draw my opposition. They told me that women wanted to be drafted into the Army. I said, ‘Ladies, I always try to be a gentleman, and I never make any reference to a lady's age. But despite your apparent youthfulness, I would have to draw the conclusion you were a few months or a few years above the draft age. Now, if you want to convince me that ladies desire to be drafted, you send me some sweet young things in here of draft age and let them tell me that”’ When the women tell Ervin that because the amendment has languished without atten tion in Congress for 47 years it should be passed immedi ately, without further study, “I tell them,” says Ervin, “I tell them, ‘Why, ladies, any bill that lies around here for 47 years without getting any more support than this one has got in the past obviously shouldn't be passed at all. Why, I think that affords most conclusive proof that it's un consideration.” DOES Ervin stand a chance of stopping the amendment, at least until some national view of the problem and the probable effect of the amend ment can be obtained? It's a long shot. If he can persuade the Senate to add enough new language to the amendment, it would have to go to a con ference committee for com promising the differences be tween the House and Senate versions. That could do it, for the conference committee would be presided over by that famous executioner, Con gressman Celler. But in the Senate Ervin's support seems light. Some are telling him privately that they think he's right, but not many are volun teering to stand beside him publicly. One of the bold ones is Senator Edward Kennedy, who, like Ervin, fears the chaos that could be dealt to state laws. Undismayed by the odds, Ervin is preparing a number of stratagems. Most import ant is his own amendment, which he hopes to substitute for the House version. It is somewhat reminiscent of the amendment once offered by former Senator Carl Hayden of Arizona. Ervin recalls with pleasure: “It was before I got to the Senate, but Senator Hayden told me about it. He said he was sitting back there when the amendment came up in the Senate, and he got to thinking about the law in Arizona that barred women from working in the mines and he thought that was a pretty good law, so he scrib bled off his change with a pencil and a piece of paper and sent it up and it was unanimously adopted. Of course, the Hayden insertion nullified the entire amend ment because it said that no law now in effect or hereafter passed giving women any rights, privileges or exemp tions shall be affected by this amendment. That nullified the whole thing.” Women militants still talk of the Hayden amendment with deep bitterness. And, if Ervin has his way, they will in future years speak darkly of the one he has written. Not that Ervin's sounds bad. In fact, the power of it is that it sounds, and indeed is, very good. It reads: “Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex. This article shall not impair, however, the validity of any law of the United States or any state which exempts women from compulsory military service or which is reasonably de signed to promote the health, safety, privacy, education or economic welfare of women, or to enable them to perform their duties as homemakers or mothers.” Which leaves the men, theoretically at least, still one ahead, not in rights but in creativity. The women may have the votes in this affair, but that is a gross accom plishment. On an individual basis, mano a mono, where is the woman, in Congress or out," with the talent to write a lovingly deadly amendment like that?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CHURCH UNIT BACKS TV ABORTION REPORT,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/23/archives/church-unit-backs-tv-abortion-report.html,"The Council of Churches of the City of New York said yes terday that a WCBS‐TV news cast on abortion on Sept. 14 was “an attempt at informing the public in a responsible man ner.” Last Wednesday, eight Ro man Catholic bishops of the metropolitan area had charged that the news report had con veyed anti‐Catholic bias and ignored moral and ethical ques tions.

Criminal Laws Called Discriminatory to Women,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/25/archives/criminal-laws-called-discriminatory-to-women.html,"Provisions in the State Cor rections Code that allow longer prison sentences for women than men for the same crime were among the many discriminatory practices ex amined yesterday at a public hearing on the status of wo men. In addition, numerous expert witnesses told the City Com mission on Human Rights, which is conducting the hear ings in the Brotherhood‐in‐Ac tion Building at 750 Seventh Avenue, that inadequate social services imposed particular dis advantages on women. They presented evidence and cited statistics to show that: ¶Abortions were still prohib itively expensive and difficult to obtain, despite the recent passage of the liberalized abor tion law. Discrimination Cited in Code ¶Research on reproductior and fertility received a low priority, even though contra ceptive devices, remained risky and caused “alarming” side ef fects. The. National Institute of Health, for example, spent $9.8 million, or far less than 1 per cent of its budget last year, on reproduction research, $105 million on allergy research, and $185‐million, or 10 per cent, on coronary heart diseases, most of whose victims are men. ¶Day‐care centers, which in Sweden, for example, are as accessible as public schools were so limited here that only about 3 per cent, or 25,000, of the 825,000 children in New York under the age of six, can be placed in them so that their mothers might be free to work. The welfare system, by granting minimal subsistance allotments, “perpetuates the cycle of poverty that reduces women” who are heads of households—the overwhelming majority of all recipients—""to undignified lowly beggars,” in the words of Beulah Saunders, first vice chairman of the Na tional Welfare Rights Organi zation. “Several forms of serious discrimination against women in the Corrections Code” were outlined by Norman Dorsen, a professor of constitutional law at New York University Law School, who is widely regarded as an expert on the legal status of women and juveniles. There are a number of in stances, he said, in which, ac cording to the code, women can be imprisoned for longer periods than men for commit ting identical crimes. A woman arrested for vagrancy or petty larceny can be imprisoned for up to three years, he said, while a man cannot be held for more than three months. Women between the ages of 16 and 21 who commit misde meanors, the code also spec ifies, are subject to “indefi nite commitment” and can be imprisoned for any period up tc three years. Men, however, are exempted from this provision, Professor Dorsen said. The legal concept of women, he said, is essentially that they are children and wards of the state who can be punished fox leviating from a strict moral code that is not applied to men “There are numerous ex amples of how this attitude is harmful and prejudicial to wo men,” he said. Prostitution Penalties Prostitution, for instance, is a misdemeanor punishable by up to three months in prison. He noted, however, that “the Law ignores the offense of men, although the crime is shared by two people” and makes patro nizing a prostitute a misde meanor with a maximum im prisonment of 15 days. “Furthermore,” he continued “a pimp — the real profiteer—cannot be arrested on the un corroborated testimony of prostitute, but a prostitute can be arrested on the uncorrobo rated testimony of a policeman disguised as a patron.” Another example of the dif fering legal views of sexual conduct by women and by men was offered by Sally Gold, lawyer on the legal staff of the Department of Consumer Af fairs. A 16‐year‐old girl could be designated a juvenile delin quent and placed in a reform school for up to four years for promiscuous behavior because promiscuity in girls is consid ered “ungovernable and unman ageable.” “There Is no such notion for boys,” hoWever, she said, and a 16‐year‐old boy who was equally promiscuous would not be punished. The hearings are to continue today.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Books of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/29/archives/books-of-the-times-aquans-single-women-and-other-bad-actors.html,"Kobo Abe seems never to rewrite himself, to worry an old bone. Each new novel translated into English, exploiting and dis carding fictional forms like clutches of Kleenex, comes as a surprise and a provo cation. “The Woman in the Dunes” (1964) was a shooting script for Hiro Teshigahara. “The Ruined Map” (1969) was a meta physical detective story. “Inter Ice Age 4” is science fiction, complete with computers predicting the future, submarine colonies and the usual apocalypse. This time, the apocalypse consists volcanic eruptions on the ocean floor and melting polar ice caps. The rising water level seems likely to wipe out terrestrial life. Scientists set about secretly to force an evolutionary mutation. Beginning with mice, dogs, pigs and cows, they arrest and alter fetal development to equip the crea tures with water‐breathing fish gills. Man is the next step. By paying mothers who want abortions, the scientists acquire sufficient number of 3‐week‐old human fetuses to start an underwater breeding farm. Come high tide, the “aquans” will take over. Convincing on Mutations Mr. Abe's revelations arrive in plausible clusters, as they are perceived by Professor Katsumi of the Institute for Computer Technique, and as Katsumi reveals himself to the reader. Katsumi has built a fore casting machine, capable of predicting eco nomic and political eventualities. The machine is also capable of reconstituting an individual personality and predicting its death day. (Mr. Abe is more convincing on Mutations than he is on computers.) To prove his machine's capacities, Katsumi in vestigates a murder, only to discover the aquan plot and to find that he is personally involved. Such a scheme gives Mr. Abe the oppor tunity to meditate on fundamental ques tions — the nature of free will, the cruelty of the future, qualities being converted into quantities for machine reassembly into dif ferent qualities — and to imagine a wholly alien world. The best parts of “Inter Ice Age 4” deal with aquan culture (under water communication, transportation, music, “land sickness,” etc.) and the breed ing farm (that manipulation of the human materials that geneticists like Joshua Leder berg yawn at with gargantuan equanimity). As science fiction, unfortunately, the book doesn't measure up to the high standards established by Frank Herbert in “Dune""; and as straight fiction it doesn't measure up to the high standards established by Mr. Abd in “The Ruined Map.” Jimmy Miller's second novel squanders too much time on half a dozen single women, of unexceptional intelligence, play ing musical beds in Manhattan. Two‐thirds of “Some Parts in the Single Life” are devoted to mate‐stealing, mate‐swapping, one‐night stands, the same old tunes on the same old organs, and smart talk. (Radical political opinions pad Mrs. Miller's book as opinions about cars, guns, clothes and drinks padded Ian Fleming's comic strips; sort of stylistic tic.) There's a lot of noisy desperation looking for, and never finding, an excuse for a transcendental tantrum. If the people are more interesting than Rona Jaffe's automata, and less monstrous than Lois Gould's nyktomorphs, they are none theless fatiguing. A Parody of Vonnegut But—and this is a transcendental but—on page 159 Mrs. Miller shifts into another, higher gear, with what appears to be an interior monologue by Mrs. Miller, brood ing on her characters, her friends, her late husband (the novelist Warren Miller, whose book titles obtrude) and madness. A kind of drug dream, from which the novel emerges into fantasy. The children of the desperate women are discovered to be liv ing in a commune, acting out a marvelous parody of Kurt Vonnegut. The French in Quebec have revolted. Radicals young and old support them with foodstuffs, ex changed for poems, and are terrorized by roving bands of “Elizabethans” — British Ku Klux Klansmen. Black versus white, Cong versus Ky, Jewish ambivalence, “Free French” babies hidden under theater seats, a duel with Max Lerner, Flower Child meets Old Leftist — what a mushroom to munch on! “Some Parts in the Single Life” may be an operational definition of schizo phrenia, but the last third is as bitter, hilarious and moving as anything in recent fiction since the scene about horse‐heads Joanna Barnes is Jacqueline Susann with a brain. An actress, sometime book reviewer and Phi Beta Kappa from Smith College, she tells the story of a child star growing up alienated in Hollywood. A few of the characters in “The Deceivers” seem to have been stamped out of stale Saltines; the sex grows like grass between each block of plot; and, as in too many first novels, everything gets resolved at a big party. But Miss Barnes is an excellent guide for tourists in the land of the plastic cactus. She is surprisingly generous. She is witty: “ ‘Marie, doesn't anything impress you any more?’ The girl thought for a second. ‘Circular driveways,’ she said.” And her book is an absorbing look at one of the circles of hell Dante didn't anticipate.

HIGH HEALTH AIDE QUITS CITY POST,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/01/archives/high-health-aide-quits-city-post-2dranking-official-to-take.html,"Dr. James G. Haughton, the city's second‐ranking health of ficial, has resigned to accept an appointment in Chicago as executive director of the Cook County Hospital Govern ing Commission.  Dr. Haughton, who joined the Health Department in 1958 a child health clinician, sub sequently held a number higher posts in both the Health and Hospitals Departments. When the two department came under the umbrella of the Health Services Adminis tration, he was named first deputy administrator of the superagency in 1966, and has served there under three ad ministrators. In the Chicago job Dr. Haughton will be paid $60, 000 a year, making him the highest paid public official it Illinois. Gov. Richard Ogilvie's. salary is $45,000; Mayor Richard Daly of Chicago is paid $35,000, In his present position, Dr, Haughton receives $37,500. Dr. Haughton sent his letter of resignation to Mayor Lind say on Monday, saying he planned to leave Dec. 31 after a terminal leave of four or five weeks. Mayor Praises Haughton The Mayor accepted the res ignation “with regret,” prais ing Dr. Haughton's “invaluable” contribution to the people of the city. Both letters were made public yesterday at City Hall. Mr. Lindsay's letter said: “I am particularly appreciative of your fine work in helping de velop, under the new state law, an abortion program which has so far proven to be both medi cally and logistically sound.” Dr. Haughton had observed in his letter: “I recognize that New York City is still an im portant place to, work and there are still important things to do in the city, but the chal lenges presented by this new position were difficult to re sist.” Behind this cordial exchange, persons close to Dr. Haughton say, lay considerable discontent on his part with his role here. When Gordon Chase became Health Services Administrator last January, a number of prom inent figures in the medical establishment said the top job should have gone to Dr. Haugh ton, with Mr. Chase taking the No. 2 position. Dr. Haughton later campaign ed behind the scenes for the presidency of the Health and Hospitals Corporation, the quasi‐independent agency that took over the public hospital system last July 1. That job went to Dr. Joseph T. English, former head of the Health and Mental Health Administration of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. When Mr. Chase began re cruiting a cadre of top deputies, Dr. Haughton complained pri vately that he was not being consulted on these appoint ments and did not learn of them until the new aides ar rived. Dr. Haughton's job in Chi cago will be comparable to Dr. English's.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Women in Pants: Even Staid Offices Concede It's Fait Accompli,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/02/archives/women-in-pants-even-staid-offices-concede-its-fait-accompli.html,"Without any confrontation, demon stration or even artful campaigning, women are securing for themselves an other human right: the right to wear pants to work. The privilege is being granted by men in industry, government, and financial institutions who have long since given up the struggle to keep women from wearing pants at home.  These male executives are doing it with the same grace that their forebears in Congress showed 50 years ago when they granted women the vote. Men today see it as inevitable. It will make life easier around the office, and be sides, there's a larger bogey—the midi skirt. While men don't equate the freedom. to wear pants with equal pay, day care centers or abortion reform, women see it as a step in the right direction. At any rate, they're taking advantage of it. “Our office just changed its tradition yesterday,” said Dorothy Nichols, who was sauntering along Fifth Avenue on her lunch hour Wednesday in a rust pants suit and plaid poncho. “Today, everybody's in pants.” Miss Nichols, a secretary at Vanity Fair, thought her company took so long about changing the rules “because we make petticoats and slips, and they were afraid women wouldn't wear any if they, wore pants.” Everyone's Happy at Bank Last week, the Irving Trust Company decided to permit pants. It made no of ficial announcement, but the word got around. “The first day, I saw two or three girls in pants; the next, there were 60,” commented Don Phelps, an assistant sec retary of the bank. “Everybody's happy about it—the tellers, the computer room girls, the customers and even the bank's officers.” The reasons for the change were threefold, according to Mr. Phelps. First, there was the feeling that wom en should dress as they choose, a by product of the women's liberation movement; second, many women had difficulty in buying clothes this fall be cause of the prevalence of midiskirts, and third, “banks really aren't as stuffy as most people think they are.” Dominick Dominick, a 100‐year‐old brokerage house on Wall Street, decided to permit pants suits this week. “Most of the girls were asking about it, so I talked to Mr. Rockefeller, and he hashed it around for a while with the other executives,” said Mrs. Connie Puma, executive secretary to Avery Rockefeller Jr., president of the com pany. “He said he'd just as soon see girls in pants as he would in midiskirts, so I guess that's why they gave in.” Accepting pants seems to be an easy way to indicate a financial institution's liberality these days. At any rate, the National Bank of North America has de cided td include a pants suit in its tellers' wardrobes, and the American Stock Ex change adopted pants suit uniforms for its Gallery Guides. The barriers are falling everywhere. Pan American World Airways included a pants suit in its winter uniform for its ground service force, and Gretchen Healy, a non‐uniformed secretary, wrote a letter to a vice president asking whether she could wear pants, too. The letter went through channels to Najeeb Halaby, Pan Am president, who sent around an approving memorandum that described the move as “symbolic of be ing responsive to new ideas from employes.” Numbers Tell the Story Pfizer, the pharmaceutical concern, decided to permit pants after a poll of employes disclosed that the staff was overwhelmingly anti‐midi. (Of 353 fe male employes responding, 307 preferred the mini, 20 preferred the midi, the rest were undecided; of 286 men, 275 pre ferred the mini, six, chose the midi.) Even though pants weren't mentioned in the poll, the company put out a policy statement accepting them as suitable business attire. Pants have been infiltrating Govern ment offices in Washington, too. Last week, five secretaries in the Department of Commerce, after checking with their bosses, turned up in pants. The staff of Representative Edward I. Koch, Democrat of New York, has been wearing pants because he believes in letting them keep up with fashion. Be cause he doesn't believe in the fashion for midiskirts, Senator Jacob K. Javits encouraging his staff to wear pants. But the word at the White House is that Mrs. Nixon doesn't wear pants on official business and that her staff shouldn't either—at least not this year. Mayor Lindsay pondered the question for a day and a half and then decided pants were acceptable in his office, ac cording to his secretary, Kathy St. John. Possibly the final arbiters of the social acceptability of pants, New York's fash ionable restaurants, are no longer trying to stem the tide. Only two are saying no today, La Cate Basque and Lafayette. Other restaurateurs, such as Laurent Losa of Laurent, have given in. “One night I turned away eight par ties, some of my best customers, and some of those women in pants looked beautiful,” he said. “I went home that night and I said, ‘What am I doing?’ and the next day I changed the policy.” But there still has to be some decorum. “Those mechanies’ pants with zippers,” said Mr. Losa, “we won't allow those.” He was referring to jumpsuits. The prevalence of pants is the one bright hope in the sticky‐wicket fashion picture. Seventh Avenue, which in its upper, prestigious regions made no great effort to push pants for fall, is enjoying an unexpected increment as pants sales flower. “The reorders are great, all over the country,” said Bill Thomas, the head of Susan Thomas. Mr. Thomas is one of the few manu facturers who saw the handwriting on the wall. He switched his production to 90 per cent pants. “Last year, we did 50 per cent of our business in pants, the year before maybe 10 per cent, but this time, there's no stopping it,” said the manufacturer, whose styles sell for $50 to $120. “There's no sign of its letting up,” he added, “and the orders are coming from all over the country and for sizes we never made before—large sizes. While everybody's talking about skirt lengths, pants are selling.” Norman Norell, whose pants sell for $1,900, but include a sweater and coat, has noticed the boom, too. “One of the things the midi length has accomplished is that it's made pants business better,” the designer said. “We've always shown pants, but we've never sold so many.” In California, where anti‐midi fever has turned into a mania, and where long skirts are languishing on the racks, pants sales are zooming. They Saved the Day In New York, where last week's hot weather and confusion about lengths slowed down business, pants were sav ing the day in stores as disparate in their appeal as Abraham & Straus and Macy's, on the one hand, and Bonwit Teller and Lord & Taylor on the other. Every store has its success story. Bonwit's, which was talking about set ting up ;separate room for pants in its junior area, found it was selling eight pairs of pants for each skirt in sports wear. Lord & Taylor reported $6,000 worth of mail orders in response to a small ad for a pants suit at $24, and sold more than 4,000 pieces of that style alone. Pants sales were up 40 per cent over last year in its suit shop. “I can't get over seeing so many old ladies buying pants,” an employe said. On Fifth Avenue and in the stores, some women shopping for fall clothes or just thinking about them are busily denying they are copping out by wear ing pants. “I just think they're comfortable,” said Mrs. William Rosen, whose husband owns Gatsby's restaurant. “I think pants suits with turtle‐neck sweaters and midicoats are the smartest thing going.” “If I weren't sure about myself, I'd wear pants,” said Mrs. Bruce Morrow, whose husband is the radio performer known as Cousin Brucie. “I've bought midi and some gaucho pants, but I think I have more pants in my wardrobe than anything else, and I wear them because I like them.” Some admit that pants are a protest. “I wear them all the time because I hate the midi, and I will not buy the midi,” said Mrs. Martin Sherman of Ridgewood, N. J., whose husband is an architect. “I can't think of any place I wouldn't wear pants, except to temple on Yom Kippur—I've already worn them to bar mitzvahs and weddings.” Her 17‐ year‐old daughter likes the midi, Mrs. Sherman admitted, but she also likes pants. For some women, pants are a libera tion. “This is the first time I've worn them in the city,” said Mrs. Stanley Sokoloff of Fort Lee, N. J., whose hus band is an insurance broker. She wore a green pants suit to a fur showing at Bergdorf Goodman and was cheered by seeing other women in pants. One of them was Mrs. Henry Reich man, who had her white wool pants suit made to order by Cosmo Sirchio because “It's hard to find something in my size.” Mrs. Reichman described herself as “full blown” and admitted to measurements of “45‐35‐45.” Evening pants have been more ac ceptable than formal daytime pants, but that trend is accelerating too, especially outside of New York, according to man ufacturers. At the Restore Ball here, the season's first big charity event, spon sored by the Kennedy family, party pants had a considerable representation. And when Patricia Lynn Cummings married to Eugene J. Gillespie, a lawyer, at Saint Patrick's Cathedral tomorrow, the bridesmaids will be wearing cham pagne‐colored pants dresses. Which may be the final indication that the most revolutionary fashion change of the year was not the hemline, but the power of women to wear pants when ever they please.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After ‘Wuthering,’ What?",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/04/archives/after-wuthering-what.html,"“‘Wuthering Heights’ should certainly appeal to the young er generation because they will identify with the situa tion of Heathcliff and Cathe rine, both of whom are wild and rebellious. The story, really, is about two people who have a strong animal communication, but a total lack of communication on a social level, and it is this ter rific hangup which makes the story . . .”  —British director Robert Fuest (quoted in an Associ ated Press interview with Granville Watts in London.) FUEST'S remake of the famed Emily Bronté novel for American International Pictures is, understandably, inspiring similar classic works to be re‐evaluated in terms of to day by other new directors, a few of whom discuss their ideas in the following ex cerpts taken from interviews to be held in the very near future, if not sooner: “What I dig most about ‘Moby Dick’ is that it's finally relevant to Now—specifically, to the 1968 Morningside Heights uprising at Columbia. Ahab's so‐called ‘mad’ pursuit of the White Whale repre sents to many of us what the kids today are searching for —a purer quality of life. “Others see the story as stern indictment of man's thoughtless destruction of nature. Do you realize the white whale is nearly extinct? What appealed to me about the book is that it says some thing about how every man, so to speak, must escape the oppressive forces of our in creasingly urbanized society and take his own personal ‘trip,’ be it an LSD experience or a whaling expedition. “Melville must have had Richard Benjamin in mind when he created the part of Ishmael, whom we will reveal as a kind of cross between Jerry Rubin and Janis Joplin. The whale, obviously, stands for the evil, hated, monstrous Establishment and will he played by a whale soon to be announced . . .” “We've always wanted to do an outspoken film about militant feminism and ‘Little Women’ seems like just the property. The Louisa May Alcott story, while nice enough for its time, is seen now in ironic perspective against the background of the Women's Liberation Front, an inevitable outgrowth of the activities of the girls in the novel. We show, for instance, just why these women were so little, how male chauvin ism made them feel so small. “Lined up so far we've got Jane Fonda as Meg, Candice Bergen to do Amy and, mak ing her film debut as Joe (cq) —the free‐thinking, free‐lance writer in the family—is Betty Friedan. We plan to take female emancipation further than ‘The Group’ or even ‘Pornography in Denmark.’ “We also have a tastefully done abortion scene I think you're going to like, set in a Planned Parenthood clinic, in which Beth dies tragically. We know it's going to disturb certain uptight people, which is our intention and, I think you'll agree, the original in tention of Louisa May Alcott. ‘Little Women ‘70’ is the story she meant to write all along . . .” “Don't think ‘Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde’ is going to be just another American Interna tional quickie. We are depict ing Mr. Hyde as a misunder stood freedom‐loving charac ter and Dr. Jekyll as the wicked unfeeling capitalist. It's a fairly revolutionary ap proach. “Likewise, we try to treat the drug problem forthrightly in scenes where the doctor drops acid, freaks out and commits irrational murders. Some may say we're capital izing on the Manson case, but all we're doing is retelling a rare old classic through which we feel Stevenson wanted to reveal something inherently warped in modern civiliza tion. We take no stand in the film on either drugs, lunacy, killing or doctors. If the movie says anything it's, ‘Do your own thing’ . . .” “We've been searching everywhere for a script that would forcefully reflect the disparity that exists today in this country between the very rich and the very poor, and we feel nothing makes the statement more effectively than ‘The Prince and the Pau per.’ “As you know, this is the Japanese director Kurosawa's first film in the United States and, since I am his assistant director and interpreter, he's asked me to say that in the movie he hopes to explore the essential roots of American decay that have led to such crises as the war in Vietnam, campus revolt and the infla tionary spiral. “Playing the alienated pau per from Appalachia will be a newcomer, Seth Hoskins, who actually is an alienated pau per from Appalachia but turns in one helluva perform ance! The part has Oscar written all over it, which is also Seth's middle name. “As the Prince—he as sumes the name after joining a hippie commune in the film —we've cast another new kid whom we found hitchhiking on the New Jersey Turnpike with the words ‘Monogram Pictures or Bust’ scrawled on a sign. Kurosawa was con vinced he had discovered the modern equivalent of Johnny Appleseed and began pound ing furiously on the car win dow, screaming in idiomatic Japanese, ‘That's him! It's our prince!’ “In our remake of the Twain classic, the only change you may notice is that the pauper so enjoys his freedom as a rootless Amer ican, sowing love and peace, that he refuses to switch clothes with the prince, a suburban runaway from Red Bank. N. J., who is fleeing the constricted values of his life as lead drummer in a folk rock band. We get around that, though, in a rather powerful scene where the boys remove their clothes and—well, I don't want to ruin the movie for you . . .”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Supreme Court Starts Work Tomorrow on a Docket Laden With Matters of Broad National Concern,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/04/archives/supreme-court-starts-work-tomorrow-on-a-docket-laden-with-matters.html,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 3—On Monday the Supreme Court will begin what could be its most active term in many years.  When they convene at 10 A.M. for the ceremonial begin ning of the 1970 term, the Justices will confront a docket laden with more cases that touch the hopes and concerns of more Americans than in any year since the Warren Court moved into high gear almost a decade ago. The situation confronting Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and his colleagues has its ironies, for President Nixon appointed him and Associate Justice Harry A. Blackmun in an effort to nudge the Court out of the center of national policy making by naming Jus tices who would “interpret” the law and not “make” it. During the placid Court term that ended last June, there were hints that other members of the Court also felt that it was time for the pendulum to swing back toward a less ob trusive Supreme Court. The majority consistently avoided bold steps and sharp shifts of direction in the law. Controversy Foreseen Yet this year, nothwithstand ing any fond hopes among. the Justices to maintain a low judi cial silhouette, the Court is faced with so many cases in volving issues of high national importance and emotional im pact that its rulings are bound to generate controversy, which ever way they go. A. rundown of the subjects represented in some of the ap peals coming up for decision is almost a checklist of the na tion's concerns: Abortion, apportionment, capital punishment, desegrega tion, divorce, criminal law, 18 year‐old vote, flag desecration, homosexuality, juvenile courts, legality of the Vietnam war, libel, loyalty oaths, obscenity, pollution, police brutality, pov erty, protests, Selective Service, sex and race discrimination in employment, state aid to church schools, students' rights, wel fare, and zoning discrimination against the poor. Even the volume of appeals has risen. After the Justices open the term on Monday with a brief ceremony, they will retire to their conference room for a week of meetings on pending appeals. Already, there are almost 1,700 cases on the docket, nearly twice the num ber that used to greet the Warren Court on the first day of the terms in the mid‐nine teen sixties. Holdovers and Activism There appear to be the fol lowing principal reasans for this glut of business: ¶The Court was hamstrung all last term with only eight Justices in attendance. Eighteen cases were held over for re argument this term, either be cause they were too important to be decided by a light bench or because the Justices were evenly divided and Justice Blackmun's vote was needed to break the ties. ¶The Warren Court's activ ism generated a momentum toward more activism. Its bold style of ruling in sweeping terms and giving individual rights broad interpretation set off chain reactions in the law, inviting new Supreme Court rulings on newly asserted rights. ¶Elements of the lower Fed eral judiciary and the legal profession were “radicalized” during the Warren years. Law yers paid‐with Government or foundation funds are filing suits on behalf of the poor to challenge laws that went un disputed before. Lower Federal judges, taking their cue from the Warren Court's freewheel ing ways, are striking down state and Federal laws at an unprecedented clip. Faces Many Appeals When this occurs, it places the Supreme. Court under a heavy obligation to review the rulings. Thus the Justices are faced with a number of appeals by the Federal Government and various states, protesting that lower Federal courts struck down their laws on such mat ters as abortion, obscenity, capital punishment, welfare, homosexuality and hit and run auto accidents. School desegregation will be the first order of business when arguments begin‐ Monday Oct. 12. The Justices have demon strated some sensitivity to Con gressional charges that the Court has been pressing for desegregation since 1954, but that it has not yet said what Southern communities must do to create the “unitary” school systems that the Court de mands. Thus the first two days of arguments will be devoted to the most emotional aspects of desegregation—whether neigh borhood schools must be pre served. Or, if children must be bused out of their neighbor hoods, when this is necessary to eliminate all‐black schools and establish a racial balance in each school. The school appeals are from Charlotte, N.C., Athens, Ga., and Mobile, Ala., but Chief Jus tice Burger has indicated that the decisions could be written broadly enough also to affect desegregation in the North. The second week of argu ments will begin with hearings on the constitutionality of the voting rights amendments passed by Congress last June that lower the voting age to 18 and abolish literacy tests and long residency requirements for voting. The test was brought directly to the Supreme Court by the United States and the states of Oregon and Texas in an effort to obtain a ruling be fore the November elections. Until last year it was unusual for states to skip the lower courts and file suits directly in the Supreme Court, as the Con stitution gives them the right to do. But with the High Court's tendency in recent years to deal in broad legal pronouncements, using lower court appeals as vehicles, states have begun to bring important issues to the Justices in the first instance. Three such original cases now pending are Massachu setts's suit challenging the con stitutionality of the Vietnam war, and two antipollution suits. In one, 15 states are accusing the major automobile manufacturers of conspiring to delay the development and in stallation of antismog devices and are asking the High Court to order them to undertake a crash program to combat air pollution. In the other, Ohio is asking the Justices to bar the Wyandotte and Dow chemical companies from discharging mercury into Lake Erie. The Court is expected to de clare early in the term if it will hear these suits. If it accepts any of them, more states can be expected to turn to this quick, relatively simple way of bringing major questions before the Supreme Court. As the other extreme, the Justices will consider perplex ing questions pertaining to abortion, government aid to parochial schools, and the draft. These questions have been the subject of so many lower court decisions—some of them conflicting — that the Supreme Court is almost forced to settle the issues. Abortion laws have been de clared unconstitutional by Fed eral district judges in the District of Columbia, Georgia, Texas and Wisconsin. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear the District of Columbia's appeal, but there is a signifi cant chance that it will send the case back for further con sideration in the Court of Appeals. Litigation over public aid to Roman Catholic schools has increased nationwide for two reasons: More state legislatures are agreeing to aid hard‐pressed parochial schools, and the Supreme Court ruled in 1968 that any taxpayer may chal lenge a Federal aid program. The Justices have agreed to hear appeals challenging the constitutionality of the Higher Education Facilities Act, which grants Federal funds for con struction of classrooms and dormitories on campuses of church‐related schools. It will also rule on the validity of a Pennsylvania statute that chan nels receipts from a tax on horse racing to pay teachers of secular subjects in parochial schools. In both instances, the key issue is whether the payments violate the First Amendment's prohibition against an official “establishment of religion.” The Court has yet to ssay if it will hear two other cases, in which Rhode Island's subsidization of private school teachers' pay was declared unconstitutional, and West Virgina's decision to provide bus services for paro chial school students was up held. During this term the Court will make a long‐delayed deci sion: Is a young man entitled to be exempted from military service as a conscientious ob jector if he is opposed to the Vietnam war, but not all wars? The capital punishment ap peals to be decided do not touch the ultimate question of the constitutionality of the death penalty, but the two issues at stake are important enough to have staved off the execution of the 550 or so per sons now on death rows across the country. Six obscenity appeals—an unusually large number—have already been accepted for re view by the Justices. They will probably agree to hear at least two more, in which the Justice Department is appealing deci sions that declared Federal antismut laws unconstitutional.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3 Pittsburgh Doctors Charged With Violating Law on Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/06/archives/3-pittsburgh-doctors-charged-with-violating-law-on-abortion.html,"PITTSBURGH, Oct. 5—Three Pittsburgh doctors were charged today by District Attor ney Robert W. Duggan with conspiracy to commit an abor tion.  The charges were filed against Drs. Wilfred Finegold, Louis Meyers and Felix Miller, whose corporate offices, the Pittsburgh Obstetrics, Gynecol ogy and Infertility Association, is in the Pitsburgh Oakland medical district. Mr. Duggan said that he and his office would not become a party to religious, moral or philosophical discussions on the subject. He said that as a result of the filing of charges he would use his full subpoena powers to obtain and review individual case records where abortions had been performed. Report From Doctors Mr. Duggan said that in the past his practice has been to investigate abortion complaints filed by the woman involved, her parents or a hospital official and to file a criminal complaint if the facts warranted. He said that in the last several months he had heard rumors and “re ceived numerous complaints re garding abortions being per formed by certain doctors in some of our hospitals.” He said several doctors had indicated to him that they had information that certain physi cians and some hospitals were terminating pregnancies for “therapeutic” reasons. Mr. Duggan said he had sought the assistance of doc tors in obtaining hospital rec ords concerning alleged abor tions and members of his staff had investigated some hospi tals. “While my investigators were not permitted access to individual case records of those whose pregnancies were ter minated, they have been can didly informed by the hospital officials that therapeutic abor tions are being performed,” he added. Mr. Duggan pointed out that Pennsylvania law prohibited unlawful abortions but did not define “unlawful.” The law is under review before the state Supreme Court. The law in Pennsylvania,” he said, “has traditionally and historically protected the fetal life, the proprietary rights of a fetus and injuries to the person of the fetus.” He said that a review of the individual case histories would be made by his staff and by in dependent medical experts to determine if prosecution was warranted. Dr. Meyers, informed of the charges, said that he did not care to comment. A preliminary hearing before a squire (justice of the peace) will be held on Oct. 13.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
U.S. Aide Says Population Rise Slows,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/08/archives/us-aide-says-population-rise-slows-population-rise-is-found-easing.html,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 7 — The “population bomb” in the United States is being defused, George H. Brown, director of the Census Bureau, said today.  The American woman is nav ing fewer children — and may have still fewer in the future, he said. The probable result, he said, is that the total popula tion will fall significantly short of some earlier estimates. The nation's future problems are thus more likely to stern from the changed nature of the population than from its explo sive growth, he suggested. In a speech entitled “1985,” the text of which was made available here in advance, Mr. Brown gave the Downtown Eco nomists Club in New York this portrait of, the future: ¶The population could ap proach a zero growth rate, but this would not be a panacea for social problems as some have suggested. In a stationary pop ulation, the average age would rise from 28 to 37. “There is concern,” Mr. Brown said, “that an older, stationary population would be more resistant to change.” ¶The next 15 years is the “era of the young married.” By 1985, the number of people in their 20's, 30's and early 40's is expected to increase by 28 million. The number of people between 45 and 64, however, will barely change. The growth among young adults will mean a massive market for housing. The possible shortage of experi enced older men, Mr. Brown said, could create unprecedent ed opportunities in government and business for younger lead ers. ¶If current trends continue, the nation is heading into “a society of an affluent majority.” By 1985, average family income is expected to jump from $8,600 to $15,000, as measured in constant pur chasing power. ¶By 1985, at present rates, almost half the population will live in suburbs, compared with about a third now. Meanwhile, the black proportion of cen tral city populatibn is likely to grow to one‐third from one‐ fifth. ¶Elementary and high school enrollment is likely to change little, but the number of col lege students is expected to surge from 7.5 million to 11.5 million by 1985. Half of this estimated growth is attributed to population growth, half to steady increases in the propor tion of young people who go to college. Mr. Brown's underlying theme was the substantial drop in the national fertility rate. In the 1950's, women of child‐bearing age averaged 3.35 children. By the early 1960's, this had dropped to 2.78. Now it is about 2.45. A fertility rate of 2.11 would —without immigration—event ually produce a zero growth rate. The rate could drop well be low the 2.45 figure, Mr. Brown said. He cited as reasons “the current concern with the effect of population growth on the environment” and increasing legalization of abortions. Such changes recently im pelled the Census Bureau to abandon the highest of four alternate population prediction series it regularly prepares. This series forecast a population of 361 million by the year 2000, compared with about 204 mil lion now. Census predictions for the year 2000 now range from 266 million to 336 million. Mr. Brown today estimated a 1985 population of 240 million and suggested a growth rate that would bring the population to 285 million by 2000. While the proportion of the population living in metropoli tan areas will continue to grow, Mr. Brown forecast that these residents would become in creasingly less crowded. There were 6,580 people per square mile in metropolitan areas in 1920, he said. By 1960, the figure had dropped to 4,230. By 2000, he said, the number should drop to 3,732. This lower density clearly re sults from geographically ex panding metropolitan areas, he said. Yet distance does not mean inconvenience. “Only about one‐fifth of all commu ters spend more than a half hour getting to work,” he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6 FEDERAL JUDGES TO BE NAMED HERE,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/11/archives/6-federal-judges-to-be-named-here-screening-of-nominees-is-reported.html,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 8 — A Republican State Senator, a woman member of the United States delegation to the United Nations and the former chair man of the New York State Narcotics Addiction Control Commission are among those in the running for six Federal district judgeships in the New York City area, Republican sources disclosed today.  The state's two Senators, Jacob K. Javits and Charles E. Goodell, are in the final stages of selecting names to be rec ommended to the Nixon Ad ministration for the judgeship nominations. Five judges will be chosen for the Southern Dis trict of New York State and one for the Eastern District. It was not immediately clear whether Vice President Agnew's recent attacks on Mr. Goodell would amper the nominations. Traditionally a President nom inates Federal judges for life terms after consultation with party leaders in the state in volved. Such nominations, however, require confirmation by the Senate, and under the tradition of “senatorial cour tesy,” a Senator from the state involved can block confirma tion of a judicial nominee to whom he is opposed. It is understood that two prospective nominees for the Southern District have been agreed upon. Persons familiar with the negotiations between New York Republicans and the Justice Department, which screens judicial nominations for the White House, identified the two as Lawrence W. Pierce, a Negro who headed the State Narcotic Addiction Control Commission until, his resigna tion last April, and Murray Gurfein, a 62‐year‐old lawyer in private practice in Manhat tan. The sources also said there was “great interest” in the nomination of State Senator D. Clinton Dominick of Newburgh, although one other possible nominee from the Hudson Val ley area is under considera tion. The 52‐year‐old Mr. Domi nick served 12 years in the State Senate but was defeated for renomination in the Repub lican primary last June 23 af ter he had sponsored reform of the state's abortion law in the Legislature earlier this year. Also reported to be under active consideration for the Southern District bench is Mrs. Rita E. Hauser, 36, a member of the United States delegation to the United Nations. Mrs. Hauser worked on President Nixon's campaigns in 1960 and 1968, and she is said to be the choice of the White House for one of the judgeships. G.O.P. Official Mentioned Another possible nominee un der active consideration is said to be Irving Kirschenbaum, a lawyer in private practice In Manhattan and treasurer of the New York County Republican organization, which is backing him strongly. It is understood that possible nominees from the Bronx are also being screened by the Senators. The Southern District takes in Manhattan, the Bronx and nine counties in the Hudson Valley. The Eastern District is com posed of Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and Nassau and Suffolk Counties. Three persons under consid eration for the one Eastern Dis trict opening are identified as Arthur S. Hirsch, director of administration of the courts for the Appellate Division, Second Department; Frank L. Gates Jr., a Suffolk County Court judge, Mark A. Costantino, a Civil Court judge from Staten Island. Most of the judgeship open ings were created earlier this year when Congress passed a bill authorizing additional judges for the United States District Courts across the na tion, Three new judgeships were created for the Southern Dis trict, and one was added to the Eastern. District. In addition there are two existing vacan cies in the Southern District. The Justice Department, bar associations and leaders of the Federal judiciary have been urging prompt action to fill the openings. When the $40,000 a‐year posts are filled, there will be 27 judges in the South ern District: and nine in the Eastern District.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Presidential Report on Education, Submitted Jan. 15 Is Released",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/11/archives/presidential-report-on-education-submitted-jan-15-is-released.html,"KEY BISCAYNE, Fla., Oct. 10 — The White House released today the report of the Presi dent's Task Force on Higher Education. The report calls for an expansion of Federal schol arships, a larger commitment to help black colleges and “a comprehensive system” of Fed era grants to graduate schools.  The report was submitted to Mr. Nixon last Jan. 15. Since then, the President has asked Congress to enact several of its proposals, including more Fed eral scholarships, a $30‐million increase hi aid for black univer sities and a national panel to consider the policy problems of higher education. The task force, headed by James M. Hester, president of New York University, also urged that the Federal Govern ment help expand two‐year colleges and consider increas ing tax incentives to encourage private contributions to uni versities. The Administration has not acted on the tax‐incentive pro posal, but has requested $100 million more for schools—like many of the two‐year colleges —that offer technical training. Asked why the President had waited nine months to release the report, a White House spokesman said that the Ad ministration had been using the report as “input” to its own formulation of education policy. Those familiar with the han dling of similar task force re ports point out, however, that withholding the reports until long after the submission of the Administration's proposals to Congress prevents the public from comparing the President's policies as he announces them with the recommendations of the study groups. It also lessens any pressure on the President to take action on the recom mendations. The White House released two more task force reports today—one on the mentally handicapped and the other on the physically handicapped. The first was submitted to the Presi dent on May 28; the second on Feb. 10. The report on higher educa tion identifies three “immediate Federal priorities”—more schol arships for poor students, sup port for the education of doc tors and dentists and increased tax incentives to support higher education. The appeal for more scholar ships noted that, in the fiscal year 1969, less than 5 per cent of the seven million American students in universities received Federal support and that the average award was $500 a student. In his education bill, the President proposed combining Federal scholarships and the Federal work‐study program and increasing the total spent on both by $229‐million in the fiscal year 1972. The amount spent for the two programs this year is $346‐million. The Administration's educa tion bill is still in committee in both houses of Congress. National Foundation The Administration's bill would set up a national founda tion for higher education, a group similar to the one that the task force proposed to study educational policy. The bill would also increase Federal aid to medical and dental schools but would not provide grants to graduate schools in general. The task force on the men tally handicapped was headed by Mrs. Winthrop Rockefeller, a past president of the National Association for Mental Health. Among the panel's recommen dations were the following: ¶The establishment of a joint council on disabilities that would bring together the President's Committee on Men tal Retardation and two new committees, a President's com mittee on mental health and illness and a President's corn mittee on physical disabilities. ¶Active Government leader ship for increased support of birth control research, wider dissemination of birth control information and increased avail ability of birth control meas ures and abortions. ¶The establishment of a sys tem of universally available day care programs from infancy to school age. ¶Increased emphasis to crime and deliquency as a mental health problem. The task force on the physi cally handicapped was headed by Dr. Ralph E. DeForest, di rector of postgraduate pro grams of the American Medi cal Association. The panel rec ommended a Presidential dec laration of “a national com mitment to serve physically handicapped Americans of all ages” and the setting up of a Presidential advisory group. While the reports were be ing released in Key Biscayne, the President was resting, swimming and watching the World Series on Grand Cay Island in the Bahamas. He is scheduled to return to Florida tomorrow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A Free Clinic for Street People —,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/11/archives/a-free-clinic-for-street-people-medical-care-without-a-hassle-a.html,"CAMBRIDGE, Mass. A 20‐YEAR‐OLD man comes to a clinic in Cambridge on a “bum mer”—a bad trip on LSD. Be cause he is frightened and agitated, unable to give a clear history, we ask him if he has a friend in the waiting room. Yes, his best friend is out there. His “best friends”—there are two of them—are then invited into the consultation room. They are given detailed instructions on how best to bring the patient “down” from his trip, including the need for at least one person to be with him at all times, to touch him, to reassure him, to “ground him in reality.” From their understanding and empathy with the patient, one would guess the task is not entirely new to them. As the three are leaving, however, one of the friends turns to me and asks if I know where the patient lives: “You see, we have only been his friends since we met him in the waiting room tonight.”  Relationships among patients in the waiting room of the Cambridge port Medical Clinic, where this event took place, are extraordinarily warm and considerate—and often poignant. Established in April, 1968, the evening clinic is situated in an old, one‐story wooden storefront down the street from Harvard and about one mile from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This is a neighborhood thickly populated by young people from all over the country, variously called hippies, street people or drop outs, who blend with the scene and are, for the most part, indistinguish able in dress from local university students. While planning the clinic, I made a very rough estimate that there were at any given time somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000 dropouts in the city's streets—some of them on drugs, and many without any apparent means of support—and from the day we opened there was no shortage of patients. From April, 1968, through July, 1970, we saw almost 8,000 patients, not only white, middle‐class hippies but also young blacks and even leather jacketed motorcyclists who mingle with the street people and who came to trust us. For the clinic's primary intent was to care for any person who had no ready access to medical care, as the invitation in the window indicates: The Cambridgeport Medical Clinic offers free medical care to anyone in need who feels unable to use existing medical services. The clinic is oper ated privately with physicians and nurses contributing their services. For the 19 nurses, more than 40 doctors and a larger number of med ical‐student helpers who have so far contributed time in the evenings for sustained periods, this work has been an invaluable opportunity to learn something about the nature of the street persons' revolt against a society that is contradictory and, at times, needlessly cruel, and also to learn about the particular ills and conflicts of adolescence. One consequence has been that the members of our staff have taken back new knowledge and ideas to their own hospitals and med ical groups, and this, we like to be lieve, has been partially responsible for the slow improvement in attitudes of hospitals in the Greater Boston area toward this group of young people. Moreover, we have had to look at our own attitudes and recognize the source—and sometimes the legitimacy —of our own irritation with many of the patients we see (for instance, our personal reactions toward their casual disregard for time), while contin uing to serve their very real needs. A NUMBER of experiences had led to my decision to found the clinic. One occurred sometime in the au tumn of 1967, when a student came to me urgently seeking advice: A friend, a girl of 19, estranged from her family and living the hippie life, appeared to him to be very ill, but she was refusing adamantly to see a doctor. Following a clumsy back street abortion in Boston, she had developed a high fever with severe abdominal pain. Friends had taken her to a municipal hospital late one night. The nurse who took the history was openly hostile and made it quite clear to the girl that she disapproved of her dress, her friends, her mores— whatever she perceived them to be —and her illness. She was told quite bluntly that she deserved everything she got, living the way she did, sleeping around, getting pregnant, having an illegal abortion, and so on. One of the physicians on duty, who saw her very briefly, conveyed more or less the same message, and told her that she would have to wait around a while before he would examine her because there were more deserving patients to be seen than she. The dose of morality that was to be forcibly administered before the grudging dose of medicine is remin iscent of the starving down‐and‐outs in George Bernard Shaw's “Major Barbara,” who had to give a thanks be‐to‐God before getting a free meal. Humiliated, angry, frightened, ex hausted and in pain, she sat in that hospital emergency room with her friends for more than two hours be fore walking out. Two days later, in desperation, she sought my help; she was then promptly admitted as an emergency patient to another hospital, where she was treated for a septic abortion and soon recovered. But not quite, for during the process of healing of her pelvic infection, an infection that had spread and intensified with the delay in treatment, some fibrous scar tissue had undoubtedly formed in and around her internal reproduc tive organs. What happened in the emergency room that first night might have cost this young woman the ability to bear children at all. It is easy to find stories of misad venture between a patient and the medical profession. But around the time that this girl was seen, I had been noticing an increasing number of young people who were getting less than adequate medical care from established medical facilities, whether public or private, especially if their dress was strange or differ ent and their style of living ap peared to be such that hospital staffs could characterize them as hippies. The kind of mistreatment I have de scribed had now become such a common experience that word had spread among the street people that local emergency rooms were no place to go unless one's medical problem was extreme and no choice remained It was clear to me and to some of my colleagues who were in a similar position to make such observations that many hospitals were giving this particular group of patients the barest minimum of treatment consistent with legal re quirements, while at the same time conveying the message quite clearly that hippies were disapproved of and would not be missed if they did not seek help there again. (However, it should be said that the kind of care these young people, receive in emer gency rooms of hospitals is deter mined largely by the particular nurses and doctors who happen to be on duty at the time that the patient arrives, and often enough they are treated with kind ness, concern and efficiency.) Against this background, the Cambridgeport Medical Clinic was established with backing frOm the Field Foun dation in New York, which guaranteed support for the first two years (recently ex tended for a further three years) when all I could pre sent to the foundation was an idea in my head. The clinic is open week days, from 6 P.M. until the last patient has been seen, usually between 9:30 and 10:30 P.M., with a staff of three doctors, two nurses and a secretary, who are able to see around 30 patients a night. The atmosphere is designed to be warm and inviting, and, most important, nonthreaten ing. Service and even most medicines are free, and ac cess to a physician is simple and easy. The patient need only give his name, age and address and then wait his turn. “Eligibility” does not have to be established, pri vacy is assured. In a word, there is no hassle. WHO are they, the young who use our services, and where do they come from? More than 90 per cent range in age from 18 to 25, and about 60 per cent are women. Only a tiny fraction are col lege students, for we dis courage them from using the clinic. If students have a beef about their own university health services, we feel they are in a position to do some thing about it themselves. Back in 1966 and 1967, young people in increasing numbers were appearing in the streets, dressed flamboy antly, flaunting colorful, ex otic clothes, usually well worn or verging on the tat tered. For this small number of “flower children,” who dared to make themselves more noticeable in so private a society, the summer of 1967 was a time of gentleness and love. It was a time when the street people handed flowers to embarrassed policemen and it was the time when pigs were no more than ham and bacon or characters in Or well's “Animal Farm.” But for all their gentleness and avowed nonviolence, the flower children, superficially resplendent and soon to be labeled with the pejorative term hippie, irritated some and enraged others. Such dis plays of openness and affec tion, so free from guile, make many Americans feel very nervous, and reactions of be wilderment or contempt or envy or open hostility are more usual than expressions of friendliness. The great majority of the children of the streets have come from white, middle‐class families. Some have dropped out from high school or from college, some from their fami lies, and all from the rat race. They are set apart from other people of the streets—hawk ers, vendors, beggars, slum dwellers and the like—by their avowed contempt for money and for things. More over, most of them come from physically comfortable homes, and, of course, not only are not alcoholics but consume much less alcohol and tobacco than their “straight” contem poraries. What is not so ob vious to the observer is the enormous turmoil in the minds and feelings of most of the street people. Beneath their outward gaiety and apparent carefree ways, there is fre quently pain, loneliness, anx iety and outright despair— feelings that doctors and nurses in the clinic have con fronted again and again. Duringthe 2½ years that the clinic has been in ex istence the street scene has gradually changed. There is a new activism among its in habitants, paralleling that in the universities. Political cam paigning, ecology action and continual tilting at “the sys tem” in numerous other ways, are all indications of increas ing engagement of the street people with social issues. The great majority, however, re main firmly committed to peace and nonviolence, and are not involved in destruc tive demonstrations, but they do express their anger and frustration more openly than they did. Another significant change is a new alliance between the dropout children of the white middle class and the children of working‐class families, many of them black. In fact, the proportion of black pa tients we are seeing at the clinic is now greater than the proportion of blacks in the over‐all population of Cam bridge. And the quality of “alienation” felt by blacks is not too different from that of whites; racism is just another, extra burden. Even now, though, most of the street people are lacking in political consciousness—an attitude that is not at all ap preciated by the activists. The Boston chapter of the Medical Committee for Human Rights, an organization of young doc tors, nurses, social workers and paramedical personnel who are usually present at major political demonstrations where injuries are likely to occur, have shown little in terest in the Cambridgeport Clinic. MOST of the street people are crowded into an area within a radius of one mile from the Harvard campus, sharing cheap accommoda tions and other resources. Some live on savings, some on allowances from family, and others work in part‐time jobs, usually menial; it should be emphasized that sharing and mutual caring is the rule. Campuses in large cities, like that of Harvard, appear to exert a magnetic attraction on those of our young who have felt the need to retreat from all that has so far been most familiar in their lives. In taking this journey, they are driven by a need to re think their lives, to learn who they are, what meaning their lives have and what future di rection they must choose. The peripheries of urban univer sities are usually comfortable places for such a search; since the coming and going in such centers allows the necessary anonymity. The street people share an admirable warmth and trust and camaraderie, recognizing in each other kindred dilemmas of the spirit; as illustrated by the story at the beginning of this ar ticle, however, deep, sustained friendships are often lacking —because the search is a very personal thing. And this in creases the loneliness. The proximity of the street scene to the universities is also determined by other fac tors, notably the atmosphere of learning. Some of the young dropouts “drop in” at the universities, merging with the crowd at large classes as nonstudents. One of the street people I came to know, a high school dropout with a history of poor grades and antisocial behavior, became a street per son in the summer of 1968. He lived a quiet, lonely, depressive life for almost one year, asso ciating first with one group, then with another, and at the end of that time began at tending courses at a presti gious university as a nonstu dent — illegally. Toward the end of the first semester he was found out, but by that time he had so impressed two instructors that he was able to persuade them to allow him to take the end‐of‐term ex aminations — without credit, without grades and, of course, off‐the‐record. His perform ance was so good that both instructors agreed, with some nervousness, to send letters of recommendation to the admis sions office and, to the credit of that university, he was then admitted for a probationary spell as a part‐time student. WE have seen in the clinic the whole range of common illnesses that this age group is prone to—respiratory infec tions, gastrointestinal upsets, skin disorders, and the like. But the group also presents special problems. For example, the most common complaint is gynecological. Many of the girls have for the first time begun to have sexual inter course and with this comes a variety of simple physical problems, usually related to a change in the normal bac terial “mix” in the vaginal tract. We have been aston ished at the enormous ig norance as to simple genital hygiene. Are mothers really so shy that they are unable to talk of such matters to their daughters, or is it that their own sexual hygiene is less than good? It needs to be stressed at this point that we have not found this group of young people to be promis cuous; their sex relationships are usually entered into only after careful consideration and mutual commitment. Other special problems in clude venereal disease, which accounts for approximately 4 per cent of all illnesses seen. Every effort is made to have such patients bring in their contact for treatment, the same evening if at all possible. Drug‐taking was not heavy at first. There were bad acid trips now and again, but far and away the most common illicit drug used by the origi nal street people was mari juana, which continues to be easily obtainable and is used more and more widely. Methamphetamine, or speed, seemed to peak about 1½ years ago and since then its use has declined, or so our experience tells us. Heroin use increased in the last year, but among the street people that we see addiction to heroin is rare. The hallucin ogens such as LSD, mes caline and DMT (dimethyl tryptamine, a synthetic sub stance that brings on a trip very like that of LSD, but of shorter duration) have waxed and waned in their usage, but much of what is sold on the street as mescaline is now in reality LSD. This is because mescaline (a safer drug) is in great demand, but LSD is easier to get. A curious phenomenon that I have observed among acid users is worth noting: So long as LSD was thought to dam age only the brain and no other organ, many intelligent people continued to take the drug. Perhaps it was that they never truly believed that acid could cause irreversible or long‐lasting damage to the brain, and perhaps again the decision to take LSD was based on the belief that one's head is one's own property and the right to “transport” it to a different place is per sonal and proper. However, when the news first broke that there was some evidence that acid could cause genetic damage, there was a signifi cant falling off in the use of LSD. Responsibility for future generations is taken very seriously. The tie‐in between hospitals and police on drug cases ag gravates the street person's natural suspicion of emer gency rooms and outpatient departments of local hospitals. Until quite recently, one of the major hospitals in the Boston area had a policy of reporting to the police any patient whose illness was di rectly related to the taking of drugs—for example, hepatitis following the shooting of speed (a serious hassle fOr the person with hepatitis). Moreover, the use of public health considerations as a ra tionale for acting as an arm of the police puts the physician in a dubious role and is, I be lieve, in the final analysis, damaging to patient, physician and society. WE do not have a cate gorical answer to the question of why some and not others of our young decide to drop out, to leave their homes and families and take a kind of vow of poverty. What we do know is that the young that we see are a searching; in telligent and resourceful group, and most of them, we believe, will eventually make significant contributions to so ciety. In fact, in their own ways, many are doing so al ready. They are a deeply troubled rather than a “sick” lot—the agonies that they are going through are quite “normal,” given the complex ity of the tasks of adolescence and the extreme turmoil of so ciety. A number of the stu dents I have come to know while working at M.I.T. have at one time or another been dropouts or street people, and they show an admirable breadth of vision, humanity and concern. Although it is rare for us to see a patient in the clinic who could clearly be labeled mentally, ill, we have found that virtually every patient has some significant psycho logical component to his ill ness or complaint. At the time the clinic was established, each physician knew that of necessity he would have to act as his own psychiatric consultant, but all of us were soon plunged into a larger multiplicity of roles. While there was a great deal of ad vising, counseling and teach ing, usually in the areas of drug habits, hygiene and nu trition, many of the patients wanted to talk about their total life situation, which they might variously describe as being “all f— up” or as an “existential dilemma.” Some would see their ‘dilemma in terms of their own “heads” and “where they are at”— this in a lonely, removed sort of way—While others focused on their conflict with parents or society. In 1968, a 22‐year‐old man came to the clinic with com plaints of headaches, in somnia and indigestion. Phy sical examination was unre vealing. A tall, angular, proud and sensitive man, he de scribed his symptoms with hes itation, for he felt that to talk of these symptoms was to ad mit to failure. In a sense, he was a failure, and on many counts, but particularly be cause his parents openly de spised him; in the confusion of his thoughts, he believed that they were justified in their hatred and rejection of him. Born and raised in a small Southern town where his father taught at an all‐white, private military academy, he studied willingly for one year at a college of business. There he was to be groomed to take over a lucrative automobile distributorship owned by his ailing uncle. At the end of that first ‘confident year, in the summer of 1964, he learned of the murder in Mississippi of the three young civil‐rights workers, Andrew Goodman, James Chaney and Michael Schwerner. Until that time, political and social problems had not seriously concerned him; with his passive, gentle personality and live‐and‐let live attitude, with his ac ceptance of a way of life that had been comfortable and agreeable, he had been able to avoid looking too closely at the underpinnings of his life, his family and his society. The summer of 1964 was the time when several hun dred young people from all over the United States joined together in a coordinated ef fort to work, within the law, for civil rights, an effort that brought about deliberate con frontations with state and Federal authorities who stood in open defiance of both the Constitution and the law. With the unfolding of the events of that summer, this man experi enced a mounting sense of outrage, alternating with shocked disbelief, that led to an inner turmoil of rage, shame, bewilderment and ter rible anxiety. In a tortured way, he managed to keep his feelings to himself but at no small cost. The following semester he was a frequent visitor to the school physician, complaining first of one set of symptoms and then of another. By Christmas, 1964, he quit school and became active in the civil‐rights movement. For the first time in many months, he felt physically well and worked very hard in a civil rights project in another Southern state. His civil rights work continued through the summer of 1965, but by then them was increasing es trangement from his family, who took a very dim view of his activities. His anxieties re turned, together with recur rent headaches, indigestion and so on. When he refused to return to college in the autumn of 1965, his father wrote a long, agonized letter pleading with his son, at the same time avowing that if ever his son was to return to their home town openly preaching racial equality or integration, it might just be that a lynch mob might meet him, and, furthermore, it might just be that he, his father, would be in that mob. The letter was signed, “With love and pity.” From then on, the life of the mind of that young man came to be almost totally identified with the civil‐rights struggle in America. He went through periods of optimism, but there were many, many more periods when his ex treme ambivalence toward his father, whom he continued to admire and love for qualities that remained separate from racial issues, led to exhaus tion and depression. He had considered seeking psychiatric help but was not sure that he would be understood, for the idea that he could be labeled a patient with a neurosis or illness was repugnant to him. If he was ill, what exactly was “being well,” and what was the “treatment” to be? When I first saw him in 1968, he was jobless, hungry, disillusioned, and too de pressed to do much about his plight. And his depression had once again given rise to bodily symptoms and turned his pre occupation from society to self. Since that first meeting, we have talked a number of times, not at length and not often but, I believe, as friends. We have talked of politics, of medicine, of the pain of growing up in America. He has learned to talk to and be helpful to others who are racked by anxieties similar to his; he has long since been free of symptoms—and now works as a teacher in a slum school. OFTEN, the gulf between patient and parent is much greater than that between pa tient and society. A 19‐year‐ old girl was ill with hepatitis. Jaundiced, weak, wretched and depressed, she needed ac tive treatment and caring that we felt could be better obtained at home from par ents and her local physician than in a hospital. She had neither adequate lodging nor responsible friends in Cam bridge, where she had been living a hand‐to‐mouth exis tence for several months fol lowing her abrupt departure from home (a well‐to‐do fam ily with a large house in a Boston suburb) after a series of violent quarrels with her mother. Now the girl felt that she would like to return home rather than go to a hospital. When I phoned her mother, I was met with a tirade of abuse: she had not “hired” me to treat her daughter, she “couldn't care less” what happened to her daughter, and, “Who Are you anyhow?” No, she did not want to talk with her daughter on the tele phone and hung up the re ceiver. Allowing about 15 minutes for cooling‐off time, I phoned once more. Mother's response this time was cold, measured, hostile: “You've got her. She's yours.” Click! went the receiver. The girl was taken to a hospital. Unhappily, we meet with this kind of situation often. The extraordinary venom that many parents seem capable of turning on their own children is startling, and is a measure of the ungovernable, direction less rage born of confused unhappiness, failure and de feat in the minds and lives of those same parents. Just as frequently, however, the “al ienation” that makes the young person withdraw or run from his mother and father cannot be accounted for by obvious rejection or cruelty on the part of the parents. Rejection and aliena tion can be caused by more subtle, imperceptible, perhaps unconscious attitudes of the parents; locked desperately in their own struggle for the sur vival of the mind, for their integrity and self‐esteem, some parents feel threatened by those, including their own children, who have adopted a different life‐style. Put an other way, some parents feel that the chaos and failure is not within themselves but within their children. This is a defense mechanism of the unconscious mind that pro tects against greater anxiety (psychiatrists call the mecha nism “projection”). WITHOUT meaning to do so, the street people have created an aura that surrounds their lives that is also attrac tive to those who feel lonely, frightened and isolated by rea son of schizophrenic illness. A 29‐year‐old man com plained of stomach trouble, stating he had seen a number of doctors who had told him there was nothing physically wrong with him. He went on to describe his symptoms in a way that indeed fitted no pattern of organic disease. When he had “bad thoughts,” his intestines would “feel as though they were rotting” and he would try to rid himself of belly pain and bad thoughts by forcing himself to vomit. Until two years before, he had been a schoolteacher in Scotland, when gradually he came to feel that he could not stand the closeness of col leagues and pupils. So he thought he would try a colder place and took a job teaching in Iceland. But again the warmth and closeness were too much for him, so he signed up on a fishing trawler seeking safety in the isola tion of a tiny boat on icy northern waters. Below decks proved to be too snug, and too close to the other crew members, so he fled this job as soon as the boat touched land. How he made the next move is unclear, but when I saw him, clearly suffering from a schizophrenic illness, he was living in a small Urban commune in the Boston area. There he had found sufficient surcease—in an atmosphere of live‐and‐let‐live — where no demands were made on him and his isolation was re spected. (It was evident that in this commune the influence of Laing was far greater than that of Leary.) The practice of caring for the mentally ill within the community instead of a hos pital is not new, although it has been “discovered” in re cent years by the planners of modern, sophisticated health centers. It has always gone on, and continues to go on, in many areas, mostly rural, of the United States and other parts of the world. During the summers of my childhood in the farm country of North Wales, for example, I, to gether with my brothers and sisters, was in no way dis couraged from mixing with persons who, in distant retro spect, I now recognize suf fered from a variety of mental disorders and whose aberra tions were accepted without particular anxiety by their families and IN the clinic's deliberately informal atmosphere, doctors, secretary, and nurses are on an equal footing, and this has helped in the development of a trusting, gentle relationship between a group of physicians who are essentially middle class and who, at least during the first year of the clinic's op erations, were mostly middle aged—I am now 46—and a group of young patients, most of whom are in some way suf fering the loneliness of aliena tion. A month or two after the clinic first opened, a group of leather‐jacketed, booted mo torcyclists arrived, announc ing truculently that two of them wanted to see a doctor. After they were treated, the group huddled at the end of the waiting room furthest re moved from our secretary and then called over to her, de manding to know the exact address of the clinic, the spelling of Cambridgeport, and the names of the doctors. Trying very hard to beIsom posed (with visions of a tense confrontation and a quick resolution by knives), she told them what they wanted to know and then timidly asked what they needed the information for. One of the cyclists, who was taking down the information in a notebook, looked up and said, “You got protection from now on!” For all their posturing and style, this group of motor cyclists was not so different in terms of adolescent con flicts from the street people we see in the clinic. They felt the need to be on guard against possible rejection or insult or humiliation. Treated with respect, they gave re spect—a necessary exchange before a sense of trusting could be established. They also were gratified, I suppose, that their trappings, their mo torcycle paraphernalia, were ignored, and that they were treated for what they were, human beings who wanted their complaints to be under stood and taken care of by a doctor. And they were pleased with the simplicity of the ad ministrative set‐up in the clinic. BY the spring of 1970, the number of young persons coming to the clinic had be come so great, and doctors and nurses were so swamped by the strictly medical needs of the patients, that we de cided to launch something new: the Cambridgeport Prob lem Center. The center, which shares the clinic's rooms, en ables professional volunteers to take a look at something other than gonorrhea, sore throats, belly pains, hepa titis and so on—and at a less frenetic pace. It has been in operation on weekdays since the first of June, opening in the afternoon and going on until the clinic takes over in the evening. The director, Mrs. Kay Worden, has introduced some novel ideas. Each day there is a team made up of a lawyer, welfare worker, social work er, psychiatrist and psycholo gist, together with one or two others with experience but no particular professional tag. However, no one stays strictly within his own professional boundaries. The lawyer might do work normally regarded as the province of a social work er. The welfare worker learns and practices a little law. And, of course, everyone poaches on the psychiatrist's ground. The interaction within the group is continuous and lively, with frequent consultation, and, having broken out of pro fessional straitjackets, every one learns a lot. As each per son—we call them “clients” and not patients during the day because they more often have nonmedical complaints —comes in seeking help for his problem, he is seen by whichever member of the staff happens to be free. If more than one member of the staff is free, no attempt is made at prescreening to de termine which of the avail able staff is likely to be of most help. In the unusual event that the problem lies squarely or unambiguously in the province of a lawyer or physician, the client is re ferred appropriately; other wise, the staff member who initially sees the client con tinues with him, always with full consultation and advice from other staff members. While most of the clients at the Problem Center are drawn from the same age group, 18 to 24, that we see in the evening clinic, many of them cannot be classified as street people. An ex‐Marine, age 22, was brought to the center by a friend. Honorably discharged from service 10 months before, he had suf fered multiple injuries of both legs from a grenade explosion while on patrol in Vietnam. During a long period span ning several surgical opera tions, large doses of pain‐kill ing drugs including opiates had been prescribed. By the time of his discharge he was addicted to opiates and with in one month was using heroin. When he came to us he was in danger of losing his job because of repeated absences and poor perform ance. He was in debt, a war rant was about to be issued for his arrest on charges of passing bad checks — f",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

r he needed far more than he could earn to pay for heroin —and he was grossly physi cally debilitated. Moreover, at tempts initiated by him to get help from a local Veterans Administration clinic proved fruitless. At the Problem Center an immediate effort by a team of lawyer, welfare worker, psy chiatrist and physician was able to salvage the situation. The same afternoon that he arrived, our lawyer went with him to the bank where the bad checks had been passed; he convinced an official that it was more in the bank's in terest to have the client sign a note to pay back in small weekly sums what he had stolen than to send him to jail. Criminal charges were withdrawn promptly. Then the friend who had brought him to the center, who was em ployed by the same company as the client, was able to per suade the company to con tinue our client's employment for a probationary period. After three months of op eration, between 20 and 30 clients are being seen in the Problem Center each after noon and, predictably, prob lems range from simple to complex, from the mundane to the dramatic. The staff of the center tries very hard not to be judgmental. Dr. Richard Goldwater, a psychiatrist in training at a large Boston mental health center and one of the first to volunteer his services to the center, puts it this way: “We are not inter ested in helping people adjust to either a mixed‐up society or any kind of mixed‐up re ality. We are interested in baying people make better life choices, and if what they want to do is what they have been doing, fine.” THE “scene” in Cambridge, like scenes in all cities, in all countries, is constantly changing, and where there is the most ferment, there is the most change. The word scene suggests the theater, where image and idea, atmosphere and plot are subtly blended, usually in a comprehensible and intelligible manner. But the theater can also leave the theatergoer confused, anxious or worried. Moreover, scene and another current word, scenario, carry connotations of unreality, absurdity, the vague expectation that some time the curtain must come down, the actors depart and the audience, the observers, return to the “real” world. I recall a late evening spent with a small group of profes sionals, mostly quite young, following a rally where Je rome Lettvin of M.I.T. had spoken in support of the =r didacy of Eugene McCarthy in 1968. The talk was of differ ent possible scenarios for the coming Democratic conven tion in Chicago. The atmos phere at that informal gather ing was tense and uneasy, the laughter quick, brutal; with out joy, and with each clever exposition of variations on basic scenarios, I became more and more uncomfortable. The “scene” in that room sug gested that terrible events were to unfold in ways yet to be revealed. My friends, “the audience,” were desperately trying to probe the play wright's mind as if their very lives depended on prior knowledge of the unfolding of the play. They felt themselves drawn into a societal mad ness that could only have some semblance of reality or believability if approached through a metaphor. Through a distillation of hundreds of conversations with street people, I have come to believe that the roots of the scene that night were more or less the same as those of the scene that has developed around Harvard Square. The “un‐American” behavior of the street people is that of actors dressed strangely in feathers and rags and splendor for roles that they do not under stand and that can never be defined, in a world without order, without reason. The stage is theirs, without direc tor, without playwright; but the producer, he is known. He is the person who is there to assure that in every enterprise, human or ma terial, there is a profit. He is sometimes seen as the par ents, who demand that the actor should be in their image: middle‐class, upwardly mobile, education‐gobbling, with goals of stability and security all buttoned‐up firm ly, and with prospects of re tirement, pension, prostatitis and then, the terminal whim per. But the producer has other faces. He is the armed services and the flag, which demand the bodies and the blood of the young for . . . what? He is the univer sity which querulously, nerv ously, insistently, continues to act as though its traditional functions can evolve ever so slowly in honorable and gen tlemanly ways, while research and development for the more efficient prosecution of war continues behind the ivy. And the producer is also the world of things, and particularly the financial establishment with its most obvious emblems, the banks. Ironically, the largest advertising billboard in Har vard Square, perched on top of a building that houses a bank with windows that were broken on at least two occa sions in the past several months, carries the following message: “Excuse me, sir, got any spare change?” This ad vertisement by a savings bank, which takes off on the pan handler's customary solicita tion, is, of course, not without humor. But it is in question able taste," since it clearly capitalizes on the very people who are denounced for caus ing chaos at ground level. ■""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
City Hospital Chief Calls Nixon Administration ‘Callous’ on Health,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/12/archives/city-hospital-chief-calls-nixon-administration-callous-on-health.html,"Dr. Joseph T. English, presi dent of the city's new Health and Hospital Corporation and formerly ranking career health official in the Federal Govern ment, has charged that the Nixon Administration is “cal lous” and “indifferent” to the health needs of the nation. “The White House staff is not placing the issue of health before the President of the United States,” Dr. English, 37‐year‐old psychiatrist, said at a luncheon interview with edi tors and reporters of The New York Times last Thursday. As a result, he said, the man power needs of the health com munity for Federal funds for more medical schools, nursing education and the training of paraprofessionals “are being met with callous indifference on the part of the Washington Administration.” “The cuts for health man power training for ‘72 will make the ‘71 cuts pale by com parison,” Dr. English said. The impact on the city will be acute, he said, especially in terms of the nurse shortage. “Unless there are significant changes in Washington in terms of willingness to support nurse education, our nurse shortage will continue into the indefinite future,” he said. Left Under Pressure Dr. English resigned last spring from his $38,000‐a‐year job under pressure from the White House staff. As Admin istrator of Heaith Services and Mental Health Administration in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, he was responsible for a $1.5‐billion program employing 25,000 people. The physician now earns $65,000 a year—$5,000 more than the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare. He overseers a $617‐million budget authorized for 18 municipal hospitals with 16,000 beds served by 40,000 employes. The new corporation, created to remove the municipal hospitals from the delays created by the city bureaucracy, went into effect July 1. Despite the responsibilities of his Federal post, “I was never in the White House,” Dr. Eng lish said. Neither, he said, was his boss, Dr. Roger 0. Ege berg. Assistant Secretary for Health and Scientific Affars. Previous Capacity Noted “We now have a situation where the nation's No. 1 phy sician, Dr. Egeberg, has pub licly admitted that he never gets into the White House,” Dr. English said. Dr. English said that “I was in the White House once week” in his previous capacity, under Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and John F. Kennedy, as director of health services for the Office of Economic Op portunity. “In HEW, we came up with one proposal after another, and the review that got in Washing ton was pathetic,” he said. Lack of Message Cited A further indication of the Nixon Administration's indiffer ence to health, Dr. English said, is the lack of a presidential health message this year. Dr. English said in response to a question that highly placed Christian Scientists in the White House—including John D. Ehrlichman and H. R. Halde man—may be a factor in this indifference, but were not major factor. The major reason, he said, was that the White House had made “a political judgment” to downgrade health. “A new President has to make his mark in major areas,” Dr. English said. “The Presi dent's major strategy was to control inflation.” He also said that health was considered primarily a Demo cratic strategy and that “they couldn't find a way to make it a Republican strategy.” The alleged White House in difference to health “may force the $63‐billion segment of the economy to get organized,” he said, referring to the health industry. A White House press spokes man declined to comment on Dr. English's statements. Dr. English recalled that he took office on the eve of a threatened strike of voluntary hospitals and on the day that the abortion reform law took effect. Six days later a volun tary hospital with an affiliation contract with a municipal hos pital, asked the city to help de fray the cost of wage increases won by the hospital's employes. “We had just signed new af filiation contracts,” Dr. English said. “Our position was that we'll review these contracts in six months. Describing another “crisis,” Dr. English said that lower level officials of the city's Budget Bureau reneged on “working capital agreement” with the new corporation. The question revolved around the corporation's right to retain payments made by patients, in the event that the corporation established methods of collect ing from patients more effi ciently. Agreement Prevailed The Budget Bureau contend ed that all these funds be re turned to the city's general fund, Dr. English said, despite a working agreement with May or Lindsay providing for a 50‐ 50 sharing of such additional funds with the city. The work ing agreement finally prevailed. The bureaucratic maze that the corporation was designed to correct was never fully un derstood, Dr. English said. For example, employes on the pay roll of one municipal hospital were actually working for an other. It was known that some hos pitals borrowed “lines”—that is, authorization for personnel —from other hospitals. But the new corporation discovered that 4,000 such “lines” had been borrowed. Dr. English said that covery was made by a corpora tion official, and not by one the many management consult ant firms that had been em ployed to help set up the new corporation. Dr. English said that, for the first time, municipal hospitals were asking their medical boards and their community groups to help prepare budgets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

POPE DENOUNCES LEGAL ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/13/archives/pope-denounces-legal-abortions-he-calls-practice-barbaric-in.html,"ROME, Oct. 12—Pope Paul VI condemned legalized abortion today as a throwback to bar barisin and uaaanism. The harsh appraisal, ex riressed in a message to a con vention of Roman Catholic hysicians in Washington, did not directly mention the new abortion law in New York State, but Vatican sources said that the Pope clearly alluded to recent United States legisla tion. The New York law, the least restrictive in the nation, permits abortion on request up to the 24th week of pregnancy. “A society that, under vari ous pretexts, moves toward legalized abortion,” the papal message said, “would be going against the efforts undertaken by centuries of civilization.” Pope Paul placed abortion on the same level as infanticide and euthanasia, or mercy kill ing, and said: “The influence of Christianity eradicated these barbarian methods little by little, but the materialistic con cepts of a pagan eugenics tend to make the most wrongful practices respectable again.’ No Change Permitted The Pontiff recalled that abortion had been considered murder since the earliest church and declared that “nothing per mits us to consider it differ ently today.” He conceded that there might be “cases fraught with anguish” when pregnancy threatened the very life of the mother. How ever, he insisted that the church could not for that reason acquiesce in so‐called thera peutic abortions. The Pope's message, in French, was signed in his behalf by Jean Cardinal Villot, his Secretary of State, and was addressed to Dr. James Far rugia, secretary general of the International Federation of Catholic Medical Associations. The document also dealt with euthanasia and medical experi mentation, emphasizing that Christian anthropology ob served “absolute respect for man, from the first moment of his conception to his last breath of life.” Either Murder or Suicide On euthanasia, the Pope said that without the patient's con sent it was murder and with his consent suicide. “What is morally a crime cannot, under any pretext, become legal,” he added. While doctors have the duty to fight against death with all the resources of science, the Pope explained, they are not obliged to use all the survival techniques developed by sci ence. Merely vegetative pro longation of life in the terminal, stage of incurable disease could be “useless torture,” he said. Discussing new medical tech niques and experiments, he said that organ transplants and re animation involved “difficult questions.” Some Opposition Here The adoption of the nation's most liberal abortion‐reform law by New York State last spring was generally supported by Protestant and Jewish groups and theologians but not by a number of Orthodox Jew ish leaders. Such Orthodox leaders as Rabbi Joseph Karasick, presi dent of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of Ameri ca, and Rabbi Bernard L. Ber zon, president of the Rabbinical Council of America, condemned “indiscriminate and blanket” abortions on the ground that no woman was the “final arbi ter about the disposition of her body and the embryonic human life flourishing therein.” De struction of a human embryo, they said, was “sacrilegious in terference with life itself and akin to murder.” The New York law leaves the decision to have an abor tion within the first 24 weeks up to a woman and her doctor. After that an abortion can be legally performed only to save the woman's life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Court to Rule on Smut Sent in Mail or Imported,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/13/archives/court-to-rule-on-smut-sent-in-mail-or-imported-justices-also-will.html,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 12—The Supreme Court agreed today to rule on the constitutionality of two Federal statutes that make it illegal to import obscene mat ter from abroad or to send it through the mails. Lower court judges nave ae dared both laws unconstitu tional. They and a few other Federal judges have interpreted a Supreme Court decision in 1968 to mean that adults have a constitutional right to obtain access to erotic material—a doctrine that hte Justice De partment says would undermine the Governmcent's efforts to control smut. At issue is the proper mean ing to be given to the 1968 ruling, Stanley V. Georgia, which said that individuals have a constitutional right to view pornographic materials in the privacy of their homes and that they cannot be prosecuted for possessing it there. In one of the appeals granted today, a three‐judge Federal District Court in Los Angeles declared unconstitutional the Federal law prohibiting impor tation from abroad of obscene books, advertisements, photo graphs and drawings. Use of Mails for Erotica Milton Loros of Los Angeles won back from customs official 37 photographs that he had attempted to bring from Europe to use in a book describing sexual positions. In the second Gase another Federal court in Los Angeles ruled that a commercial dealer in erotica had a right to use the mails to deliver obscene material ordered by adults. Arguments in the appeals will be heard later in the term, when the Court will consider a similar ruling by a Federal court in Boston. It was held that the Swedish erotic movie “I am Curious (Yellow)” could not be banned in Boston because it gave adults with the price of admission the same right to view erotica in private that the defendant in Stanley V. Georgia gains through his ownership of a‐projector and “stag” films. The Court also agreed today to consider a suit brought di ectly in the Supreme Court by the State of Ohio to stop two chemical companies from dis charging poisonous mercury‐in to Lake Erie. Ohio sued the Wyandotte Chemicals Corporation, which has a caustic soda and chlorine plant in Wyandotte, Mich., and the Dow Chemical. Company and its Canadian subsidiary, over mercury emissions from their plant in Sarnia, Ont. The Constitution permits states to sue citizens of other states and foreign countries directly in the Supreme Court, without going through lower court appeals. The suits ask for a Court order to end the pollu tion, and damages for past pollution. The Justices let stand a deci sion by a three‐judge Federal court in New York that re quired trial‐like procedures be fore tenants in public low‐cost housing units may be expelled. Under the ruling, tenants can not be ousted or fined without notice of the complaints against them and a hearing where they may cross‐examine the individ uals making the complaints. In another action the Court, let stand a lower court's hold ing that the Wisconsin anti abortion law was unconstitu tional because it infringed on what the Court termed women's constitutional rights to obtain abortions in the early stages of pregnancy. The Supreme Court cited cases to indicate that it was dismissing Wisconsin's appeal on procedural grounds, and that its action did not indicate ap proval of the lower court's rea soning. The Justices also took steps today to reduce the increasing amounts of court time that have been consumed in admit ting lawyers to practice. Tra ditionally, each lawyer has been presented in Court by name, and the Chief Justice has recognized each by name be fore the oath‐taking. Frequent ly, the first half‐hour or so of the court's day was absorbed by this ceremony. Today the Court issued a new rule that permits qualified lawyers, those who have been admitted to practice for three years in their home states, to send their application and their $25 fee to Washington by mail. They will receive an Impressive license qualifying them to prac tice before the Supreme Court.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Encouraging Murder,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/14/archives/encouraging-murder.html,"America is embarked on a rampage against life, potentially far more ex tensive, and already far sicker, than any of the great genocides of history. This genocide has many weapons: government life‐prevention campaigns, sterilization, proposals for genetic manipulation, euthanasia. But the most flagrant at the moment—because the killing is direct and open and lawful— is abortion. The Nazis are believed to have killed six million Jews in less than a decade. The Americans, if current projections are borne out, will have killed six mil lion unborn babies in less than three years. In New York hospitals alone 300,000 murders of innocent children will be “recorded” this year. You have only to dial one of these hospitals‐become‐slaughter‐houses to realize that abortion has become rou tine, even casual procedure in America. “Hello, pregnancy interrup tion service,” a cheery voice accosts. If you're a woman you will be able to stroll into a clinic, have a baby yanked from your insides, stop off at a beauty parlor, then come home to cook sup per for the ideal‐American two‐child family. No one doubts that what is going on—what mothers and fathers are per mitting, what governments, the medi cal profession and the mass media are encouraging—is murder. No one needs recourse to theological speculation about when the soul enters the body. Medical science has learned enough about the indices of human life in the first weeks of pregnancy, and New York law‐makers in particular know enough about the indices of life after six months of pregnancy, to make clear that what is intended is the destruction of an innocent human per son. What is the explanation? Part of it, doubtless, is economic. The American life style easily translates what were formerly moral and personal choices into the language of the exchequer: spiritual lives are based on the principles of cost ac counting. It is cheaper not to have a baby than to have one; so, contracep tion failing, you kill it before it makes significant demands on your pocket. A more basic explanation is non serviam. Men nowadays no longer wish to take responsibility — to be obligated. They no longer wish to‐give. Sex, instead of being the meeting place for love and life, the supreme occasion for giving both, has become an act of masturbatory gratification. The conventional excuse for contra cepting and aborting babies is that catch‐all cop‐out, the “population ex plosion.” But the initial scare of en vironmental apocalypse is over —the myth of too many people is now being abandoned even by those active in population control circles. What is left is not a population explosion, but a masturbation explosion. If sex is not open to the giving of life, it cannot be open to the real giving of love either. Behind all of this lies a deeper sick ness: an increasing hatred of life itself. The Women's Lib crowd does not think of itself as Calvinist, but of course it is. Today's abortion and life prevention campaigns, which go hand in hand with the denigration of woman, spring from a deep pessimism about life, its goodness, its purpose. Someone has recently termed this perverted mind set “The New Manicheanism.” It re gards the universe as composed of two warring forces — spirit and matter, good and evil—with the baser side all too frequently winning out. Life, sex, babies, form part of the wicked realm of the flesh: bringing new life into the world is regarded as the height of irresponsibility, the chief sin. The secularized Puritan conscience thus sees the American genocide as a good, and in its own fastidious manner makes sure that womb‐scraping is an acceptable antiseptic procedure. Genocides are always selective. The American Puritans do not (yet) wish to destroy themselves. The unwanted are others. Today it is babies who are unwanted; tomorrow it will be the crippled, the deformed, the economi cally non‐productive, the socially in convenient, the elderly. But the selec tion is still more refined. Those are most unwanted who present the most problems.” And who present the most problems to America? Generally, the poor. Particularly the blacks, the Puerto Ricans, the Mexican‐Americans. Manichean America canot be con verted, or even dealt with by conven tional means‐through the election of a new team of rascals. It is a repub lican regime which now spearheads these policies;but in responsibilty there is no useful distinction between Republicans and Democrats.conser valives and liberals. The cure, if there is one, will come from a militant con stituency preeminetly concerned with the sancity of human life. In this mil tancy Christians will play their role. If you're a woman you will be able to stroll into a clinic, have a baby yanked from your in sides, stop off at a beau ty parlor, then come home to cook supper for the ideal‐American two‐child family.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Daniel Haller's ‘Pieces of Dreams’,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/15/archives/daniel-hallers-pieces-of-dreams.html,"It was probably inevitable that someone would finally get around to making a film about the progressively con cerned young priest at odds with the church who finds happiness in the arms of a pretty young thing. The theme is inherently dramatic but fraught with dangers for the unsophisticated. If there is to be dramatic conflict, the spiritual dimen sion must be trapped before the disillusionment takes over. That never happens in “Pieces of Dreams,” a really dreadful little movie based on William E. Barrett's novel, “The Wine and the Music.” The film humorously touches all the clerical and romantic clichés — the pill, abortion, juvenile masturba tion, tippling pastors and ob scurantist priests. The grow ing romantic conflict is con veyed through quite pretty pictures of the priest and his mistress romping through winter woods around Albu querque while an off‐screen voice sings, “Little Boy Lost.” Its that kind of picture. Robert Forster is wooden and humorless as the origi nally puritanical priest, and unconvincing, later, as the lover wrestling with his vows. Lauren Hutton is pretty as the girlfriend and gives some evidence that she might be able to act given more favorable circum stances. Most of the others are merely characters in ludic rously stylized set pieces by Daniel Haller, the director, who, in turn, was fighting some of the most unbeliev ably simplistic dialogue to be heard hereabouts. In short, “The Cardinal” looks great next to “Pieces of Dreams.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Population Outlook,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/17/archives/population-outlook.html,"Is the population bomb defused? Census Director George H. Brown thinks it has been. He cites data show ing that American women are having fewer children, and he views as probably too high the oft‐quoted estimate that the United States will have 300 million persons in the year 2000. Tomorrow's population problems in this country, he suggests, will arise more from the changed composition of the American people than from explosive numerical growth. Demographers predictions have often been wrong in the past, and they have erred both on the high and the low side at different times. But if Mr. Brown's forecasts must be viewed with caution, there is no denying that his views accurately reflect the experience of recent years. The baby boom in this country reached its peak almost a decade ago, and the reduction since then re sulted in roughly 700,000 fewer births last year than in 1961. Moreover, both whites and nonwhites have par ticipated in the sharp birth‐rate declines of recent years, though nonwhite birth rates continue to be roughly 50 per cent higher than those of whites. The many subtle and complex forces involved are too little understood, however, to justify dogmatism about continuation of the recent trend toward slower population growth. The “pill” has undoubtedly made a major contribution toward cutting births, but the doubts raised recently about its safety have made some women less willing to use this efficient contraceptive technique. Any loss here may be more than balanced, however, by the legalization of abortion in this state and the prospect that existing bars to abortion will soon be lowered or removed in many other parts of this country. Concern about pollution also exerts growing pressure for fewer babies in many families. All present perspectives on future population could be altered if there were dramatic changes in the mortality side of the equation. How extensively will narcotics addiction—and its numerous tragic contributions to deaths in the 15–30 age bracket—develop? Will medical science find simple and generally available cures for cancer and heart disease in the near future? The highest rates of population growth are abroad, in Latin American and other “Third World” countries. Fundamentally the population problem is a global one and good news about slowing birth rates in this country alone cannot and should not end anxiety about the much darker picture in the world as a whole.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Boston Woman, 23 Dies After Abortion Performed in Office of Physician Here",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/17/archives/boston-woman-23-dies-after-abortion-performed-in-office-of.html,"A 23‐year‐old woman diedi of internal bleeding last week after her uterus was perforated; during an abortion in a physi cian's office here. News of the death, which got no public attention when it occurred Oct. 10, was made) known yesterday by a city: health official. City regulations that take effect Monday will prohibitI physicians from performing abortions in their offices. A few doctors have announced they intend to defy the regu lations. Dr. Milton Helpern, the city's Chief Medical Examiner, whose office performed an autopsy following last week's death, said yesterday: “This case points up the wisdom of the regulations which the Board of Health has promulgated.” Meanwhile, a public hearing was held here yesterday by three public officials who op pose the new restrictions: Representative Edward I. Koch, Democrat of Manhattan; Bor ough President Percy E. Sutton, and Councilwoman Carol Greitzer, Democrat‐Liberal of Manhattan. The woman's death last week was the 10th related to abor tions in the city since July 1, when the state's liberalized abortion law—the most permis sive in the country—took ef fect. Of these, four occurred in hospitals and six resulted from abortions that were started out side of hospitals (some of these victims were rushed to hospi tals too late to be saved). The latest victim was 23‐ year‐old Mrs. Maria Hernandez Ortega, a Guatemalan citizen who had lived in this country for eight months. She resided in Boston with her husband, Luis Ortega. To get the abortion, she and her husband came to New York and stayed with a friend, Al fonso Paniagua‐Garcia, at 90‐35 178th Street, Jamaica, Queens. The operation, a standard dilation and curettage, was performed at about 5 P.M. Sat urday by Dr: Armida Zepeda in her office at 1440 York Avenue. Dr. Zepeda later told the city's deputy chief medical ex aminer, Dr. Michael Baden, that she had been unable to find the fetus and concluded that Mrs. Ortega was not pregnant. What Dr. Zepeda did net realize (and the autopsy later showed) was that her curette had plunged completely through the uterine wall. Dr. Baden pointed out that Dr. Zepeda had done nothing illegal. Mrs. Ortega appeared in good health after the 20‐minute op eration and was driven back to the Queens apartment. She died there at‐10 P.M. The autopsy showed massive internal bleeding and expulsion of the fetus into the abdominal cavity. I Dr. Zepeda said the patient had said she was two months’ pregnant. The autopsy, how ever, showed the fetus to be more than four months old. At yesterday's public hear ing, held at Freedom House, 20 West 40th Street, Mr. Sutton chided the Board of Health for not sending a representative. “No medical evidence has ever been presented by, the Board of Health to support its ban on in‐office abortion and most clinic abortions,” Mr. Sut ton said, “and we feel that the board, has an obligation to the public.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At 17, the Road to Abortion Is Lonely",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/18/archives/at-17-the-road-to-abortion-is-lonely-at-17-the-road-to-an-abortion.html,"At 2:30 on a Thursday afternoon Carol, a sol emn 17‐year‐old girl from a small Midwestern tourist town, stepped out of the first airplane she had ever been on and walked into the passenger terminal at La Guar dia Airport. She carried a fringed shoulder bag and an over night case stuffed with a nightgown, several popular romance magazines, toi letries and $490 in traveler's checks. She expected to stay just two days. Carol, an unmarried, preg nant high school senior, had come to New York to take advantage of the state's lib eralized abortion law. She is among thousands of out‐of state women—from their teens to their 40's—who have come here since July 1 in hope of obtaining a legal abortion unavailable in their home states. Many have come with def inite appointments, others on the basis of tips, still others with little more than the hope that if they are in New York they will be able to find some doctor to help them. Many of these women, faced with seeming endless delays, insufficient funds or lack of connections, have re turned home the same way they came—pregnant, but minus the money they spent on transportation and living expenses. Beginning tomorrow morn ing, they will face new problems. New city regulations take effect then that will prohibit physicians from performing abortions in their offices. Carol (not her real name) was met at the airport by this reporter through an ar rangement with a mutual acquaintance. “It's exciting coming to New York,” Carol remarked as the taxi from the airport crossed the Triborough Bridge into Manhattan.’ “It's too bad I can't tell my friends back home about it.” It was one of the few com ments she made about her dilemma during her stay here. Carol had found her way to New York through an abortion referral service in her home state, which had made an appointment for her with an obstetrician‐gynecolo gist on Manhattan's Upper West Side. The doctor had al ready reserved a bed for her at a nearby voluntary hospital where he expected to perform a dilation and curettage on her the following day. The total cost was to be $400. A pale, pretty girl with shoul der‐length blond hair, green eyes and a nervous, throaty giggle, Carol was shy and scared. In a voice barely audi ble across the doctor's desk she told him that she had had in tercourse on two occasions. She remembers little about either of them. Both times, she was drunk. No, she had not used a contraceptive. Marriage Out of Question A doctor near her hometown had examined her a week earli er and told her she was eight weeks pregnant. Marriage, she explained later, was out of the question. The boy responsible for her pregnancy was still in school and, besides, she didn't love him. At first she considered hav ing the baby. “But I couldn't have given it away,” she said. “I would have kept it and given at all I could. But I realized that wouldn't be much. It wouldn't have been fair to the baby.” Carol's parents are divorced. She had been living with her mother, two small brothers and her stepfather, who she said has beaten her on more than One occasion. Recently she had moved out and rented a room, but the prospect of bearing and caring for a child was more than she could face on her own. In New York, the gynecolo gist took Carol's medical his tory and explained what the abortion would be like. Then he examined her. He discovered that she was about 16 weeks pregnant, not nine weeks as she had thought. “I'm sorry, Carol,” the doc tor said, “but you're too late. I can't help you.” ‘Salting Out’ Suggested He explained that at her stage of pregnancy, a D and C —surgical removal of the womb's contents either by scraping or suction—was not safe; she would have to have what is commonly called a ““salting‐out”—an injection of a salt solution into the uterus that triggers a miscarriage some 12 to 48 hours later. The doctor cautioned her that a salting‐out was a basically sim ple but potentially dangerous technique that required consid able medical skill. The doctor further explained that one of the hospitals where he practiced would not allow him to do this procedure on its premises, and that the oth er hospital allowed only three salting ‐ out procedures each day. At the latter hospital there was already a waiting list six weeks long. Until early September, the doctor said, he had been doing salting ‐ out procedures in his office. “Then I learned that the Board of Health was going to make office abortions ille gal in the city, so I broke up the equipment.” As the doctor spoke, Carol's eyes welled with tears. She was told that most hospitals in the city where late‐in‐pregnancy alxiitions were performed had long waiting lists. Moreover, in a hospital a salting‐out pro cedure was likely to cost con siderably more than the $400 Carol's real father had man aged to give her. Difficult to Wait Because of her limited finan cial and psychological resources and because Carol had neither friends nor relatives in the city, it was clearly out of the question to ask her to wait around for weeks until a hospi tal abortion could be arranged. The doctor suggested she try to find someone outside the city Who would do the injection as an outpatient procedure, either in his office or in a hospital clinic. She could fly home im mediately afterward or else wait in a motel until labor be gan and then check into a hos pital emergency room to have the miscarriage. Finally, the Manhattan doctor gave Carol the name of a phy sician in Syracuse who might help her, and his nurse gave her a copy of New York maga zine that contained a list of several sources of abortion referral. Then began a telephone mar athon: 37 completed calls, and countless others that did not go through, all over the state. Throughout the two‐day phon ing session Carol was sullen, almost as if she expected each call to prove “no go.” These were the results of the calls, referrals, tips, ru mors and false leads: ̼¶The Syracuse doctor said that no one in his city was doing salting‐outs. He himself no longer did abortions in his office, but he named two other doctors who might help. ¶ A nurse in the office of an Ithaca doctor said that he did salting‐outs as outpatient pro cedures, but that the doctor would not schedule her until he examined her. With Ithaca a five‐hour drive from New York City, this sounded too vague to Carol to warrant a long trip. ¶ A doctor in Norwich would do the injection in his office for $375, but his nurse said he usually liked to wait until the 18th week of pregnancy. Again faced with a possible wasted trip, the girl demurred. ¶The Woman's Abortion Project suggested a doctor on Long Island who charged about $300. The physician, it turned out, was on vacation, but his answering service said that a “covering” doctor would call ¶A call to the Clergy and Lay Advocates for Hospital Abor tion Performance brought the response that they “usually didn't do referrals.” Neverthe less, they gave Carol the name of a doctor in Westchester. A Shock to Carol That doctor was “completely booked and terribly over worked,” according to his nurse. He was doing about 30 salting‐out procedures a week in his office in addition to all his regular obstetrical work. This was a blow to Carol, for this doctor's fee was only $150. ¶ Several doctors, whose names were supplied by the helpful Westchester nurse, of fered some hope. One would do the procedure in his office for $300. Another would do it in a hospital clinic: his fee was $200 if Carol went home after re ceiving the injection; $300 if she returned to the hospital for the miscarriage. Hospital charges would run about $150 in the latter case. Faced With Dilemma Carol was frightened and confused. Having an injection and then getting on a plane for the Middle West without knowing when labor might start was risky. On the other hand, going to a hospital was more than she could afford. Back to the telephone. The Family Planning Information Service, operated by Planned Parenthood of New York City, advised against an outpatient procedure in Carol's case. They offered to help find someone who would do an in‐hospital abortion without much delay and within Carol's financial means. At noon on Saturday Carol was in the office of a Brooklyn obstetrician recommended by the family planning service. For two and a half hours she sat in the waiting room listening to other patients—women hap pily chatting about their wanted pregnancies. Carol shut her eyes, put her hand over her face and sank lower and lower into her chair. She didn't say a word. Finally, after all the other patients had left, the doctor called Carol in. Again, an examination, medical history and Carol's story. The doctor told her that the hospital required an advance cash payment of $325 that would cover her regardless of how long she stayed. His fee, he said, was $350, but he was willing to do the procedure for the $75 Carol could give him if she promised to pay the rest in installments afterward. “However,” he added, “the hospital is heavily booked and I can't give you a definite ap pointment. You'll just have to wait for my call.” Thoroughly depressed, Carol slept for most of the next 36 hours. Late Monday morning, the doctor called and said she could enter the hospital the next morning. She called her father with the good news. “I can't wait to see you again,” she told him. Letter of Consent At 9 A.M. Tuesday, Carol was admitted to the maternity floor of a small, old hospital in Brooklyn's East New York section. She was already in her nightgown in her hospital bed, two doors from a nursery full of newborn babies, when the administration decided that Carol's telegram of consent from her father was in sufficient. Carol could stay in the hospital, but the procedure could not be done until they received a letter with her fa ther's notarized signature. Another call to her father. “I just want to get it over with and go home,” she said over and over again. At 10 A.M. Wednesday, the special delivery letter arrived and a few minutes later the doctor injected the salt solu tion. Then there was nothing to do but wait until labor started. Finally, at 10 P.M. Thursday the cramps began. All night Carol paced the floor, did situps and jumped up and down with her labor. At 8 A.M. the next morning she expelled the fetus. Two and a half hours later, the doctor assisted in re moving the placenta, which she, had retained. When It was over, Carol was exhausted and running a high fever. In her almost delirious state, she muttered that she never wanted “anything like it to happen again.” The doctor spoke to her about birth control. He gave her a prescription for oral con traceptives and told her about contraceptive foam. He cau tioned her that regardless of her intentions, sometimes things happen, and most men expect the woman to take care of contraception. Carol was discharged from the hospital on Saturday morn ing with a prescription for anti biotics to control the low grade fever she was still run ning. Seven hours later she was headed home by plane. Throughout her experience Carol had said little of how she felt except for her periodic lament about getting it over with and going home. But her face spoke what her lips failed to utter. She left New York nine days after she had ar rived and her once‐babyish face seemed to have aged a year for every day she had been here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Conservatives Are Out to Beat— Rockeberg, Goldfeller, Ottindell and Goodinger'",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/18/archives/the-conservatives-are-out-to-beat-rockeberg-goldfeller-ottindell.html,"JUST as surely as Vice President Agnew may not be whistling “Dixie” in criticizing the news media for lapses of objectivity—as demonstrated by the clipping at left from the Northport Journal—the facts of political life in New York State in recent years have altered radically, or rather, Conservatively. And a quick look at what politicians still like to call the arithmetic tells the story: • In 1962, in its maiden election outing, the newly formed Conserva tive party tallied 2.4 per cent of the gubernatorial vote. • Four years later, in the guberna torial election of 1966, the Conserva tives became the state's third largest —or largest third—party, polling 8.5 per cent of the total vote and thereby capturing “Row C” from the Liberals. • Two years ago, in the senatorial race of 1968, its candidate, James L. Buckley, received 17.3 per cent of the ballots recorded. • In the current senatorial race, the same Conservative nominee, Buckley, is rated by knowledgeable profes sional handicappers as no less than a 3‐to‐1 shot to win the three‐man con test. With open support from some Republican leaders and at least a tacit endorsement from Agnew, the Conservative party candidate is given an even chance of polling over 33 per cent of the vote. Clearly the Conservative party is a growth party. Clearly its senatorial candidate is a serious contender. But exactly what is the Conservative party? Where did it come from? Who are its members? What do they want? And why are they suddenly playing such a significant role in our political life? ON a recent Saturday night, over 600 true, red‐white‐and‐blue Conserv atives and an assortment of chame leonic politicians gather in a Has tings‐on‐Hudson restaurant to en hance the party's coffers (Donation: $19. “Best Wishes From a Recon structed Effete Snob,” reads an ad in the glossy journal) and to pay hom age to the party's ticket. The chief attraction of the dinner‐dance of the Westchester County Conservative party is obviously James L. Buck ley. Standing in the foyer, waiting to greet Buckley, wearing black ties and frilly shirts and sipping cocktails, are Westchester County Chairman Wilson Price, State Chairman J. Dan iel Mahoney, Ed Leonard, the party's candidate for Lieutenant Governor, their wives, and Paul Adams, the candidate for Governor. Mahoney is buoyantly optimistic about the Buckley campaign: “We'll win. We'll need 40 per cent of the vote to win and we'll get it.” But isn't thete a danger that since Nixon is such an organizational Republican he might offer token sup port to the regular Republican candi date, Goodell, at the last minute and thus cut into the Buckley vote? “Not a chance,” laughs Mahoney: “Not a chance in the world. If Nixon were going to support Goodell in any way, do you think he'd have Agnew out making those speeches? Besides,” he pats his pocket and smiles the smile of the professional politician— one of boastful accomplishment rather than genuine glee—”I have assur ances that the White House is not going to endorse the regular Repub lican candidacy of Charlie Goodell.” Mahoney's tall, handsome blond wife, Kathleen, comes over and takes my arm. “Have you met Paul Adams yet? You have to meet him. He's such a wonderful man. As fine a per son as I've met in my life.” Adams, a dean at Roberts Wesleyan College near Rochester, is a slight, soft‐spoken man, who wears the kind of neat mustache stock company idols once affected so they could play both heroes and villains. I ask him how he feels about rumors that he has been cast in the role of a sacrificial lamb on the Conservative ticket and that he is being an invisible candidate. “Do I look like a sacrificial lamb? Do I look invisible?” He shakes his head as if disappointed by the insip idity of the accusations. “Look, it's perfectly logical for me to run for Governor my way, since I polled over a half million votes running for that spot in ’66. It's perfectly logical for Jim to be running for Senator his way, since he got over a million votes running for that job. It's also per fectly logical for there to be more national interest in Jim's race than mine — and more national money available for him — since the Senate is a national body.” Buckley arrives and suddenly a flock of local candidates for the State Assembly and county judge and the family court all materialize around him. And one by one they have their pictures taken with him. I ask the patiently smiling Buckley what he thinks he will be stressing for the remainder of the campaign. “Oh,” he begins to rattle off: “Restoration of stability. A control of the avalanche of disrespect. The failure to treat law breakers firmly.” What about Israel? “Secret diplomacy,” he lifts a finger in the air. “I've been to the Middle East, you know. Secret diplomacy is the key.” UPSTAIRS in the dining room, aft er the honored guests are greeted with the applause of the hungry guests, Wilson Price introduces local monsignor, who, after beginning his invocation, “Bless those who de part …” stops short: “Ooops. Wrong paper!” He fiddles in his pocket and starts again: “Bless those who gather.…” Next, Price leads the assemblage in the Pledge of Alle giance to the Flag, which stands to the rear of the drum on the band stand. And then the band, featuring an accordion, plays conservative dance music while dinner is served. “That music is straight out of the Middle Ages,” observes a 26‐year‐old Buckley aide sitting next to me. The British wife of a Buckley speechwrit er across the table matter‐of‐factly lights up a cigar. Her husband makes a disparaging remark about Arthur Goldberg. But Buckley's chauffeur, seated at the corner of the table, quietly disagrees: He has driven for Goldberg. Politics, it seems, makes for odd table couplings and interesting riding arrangements, as well as strange bedfellows. I look about the room and spot single black at a table near the en trance. I sidle up behind him and ask: “How many brothers here to night?” He giyes me a down‐home laugh: “I ain't only seen but one.” The young Buckley aide has also been studying the house ethnically. When I return to the table he tells me: “It seems everyone here is Irish —or at least Catholic.” Now Wilson Price takes over again, introduces all the local candidates and officeholders—the solitary black turns out to be an alderman from Yonkers—and the usual speechmak ing begins. Anthony R. Spinelli, the State Controller candidate, points out he is the only Italo‐American on any ticket, adds that he is also half Irish and that his wife is Polish and Rus sian, and attacks the “Rockeberg, Goldfeller, Ottindell and Goodinger” candidacies. Leo Kesseiring, the At torney General aspirant, attacks cam pus disorders, flag desecrators and Adam Walinsky. Westchester “Favor ite Son” Ed Leonard urges the death penalty for narcotics pushers, and argues that the same logic which might lead a voter to vote for Buck ley inevitably must lead the same voter to vote for Adams, too. Adams himself at first indulges in Conservative levity. He tells how his flight to a fogged‐in Buffalo for a similar dinner the night before wound up in Cleveland instead. “Could any thing be worse?” bemoaned the man seated next to him on the plane. “Yes,” Adams said to him, “Charlie Goodell could endorse me.” Then Adams puts on his glasses and settles down to a basic speech. There had been prolifigate spending during the Rockefeller years, there was a constantly mounting state debt and burden of taxation. He chal lenges Rockefeller to debate. And he zeroes in on his newsbreak for the evening: “The greatest single menace to the suburbs today is Rockefeller's Urban Development Corporation.” “This monster bureaucracy,” he reads from his own mimeographed press release, “has the power and has the money to blanket the sub urbs with concrete and to build high rise apartments virtually in your back yard. It has the power to raise $1‐billion, and it has the power to use that money to come into your community, override your local zon ing laws, and build anything it wants, anywhere it wants, in New York State—and there isn't a thing you or your local elected government or your local zoning board will be able to do about it.” Adams gets polite applause. When Mahoney introduces Buckley the audi ence cheers loudly and rises to its feet. There is little doubt as to the brightest star in this year's Con servative firmament. “Thank you, ‘Boss’ Mahoney,” be gins the candidate, the Buckley wit sparkling in his eyes as he jiggles with the microphone. He speaks in a voice pitched slightly higher than his normal one as he goes rambling off into set—and pet—phrases: “… new element in American politics— violence … the rejection of the American dream … the permissive ness of American intellectuals … a group of people out‐to destroy us … decay of moral fabric … 4,500 bombings in the last 18 months … 40 cops killed in ambushes since the beginning of the year. Three times as many New Yorkers die because of heroin than because of the VC. 100 campuses in flames. What's hap pened to the America we love?” “Jim,” whispers the young aide next to me, “is extemping.” “But he's reading from notes,” I say. “That's what I mean,” says the aide. “He's only using notes. He's extemping from notes” “We of the silent majority have got to speak up,” Buckley is saying. “We have to speak up for those who when called to service—serve. For the rank and file of American work ers such as those who marched in the Wall Street‐City Hall demonstrations. For all those students who resent the strident minority. We can't have free dom without order. And order is un der attack” He touches fleetingly on pollution (“We must encourage the use of the energizing initiative of private in dustry”), pornography (“We must halt the pollution of the minds and morals of the young”), and the poor (“They must be helped with training and education and prodding to help themselves”). As a phrasemaker, Jim is something less than his brother, rococo Bill. As a speechmaker, he is more reminiscent of his Yale class mate John Lindsay; Jim, too, it seems, has the capacity to take an audience that is ready to be exhorted to fever pitch and work them over so that they finally tender him only dutiful applause. But not this Conservative party audience. They rouse themselves to give him a tumultuous standing ova tion. NEW YORK STATE has a long tradition of third parties. The Con servative party was formed in 1962 by a nucleus group of young post Taft, pre‐Goldwater Republican law yers who worked for Wall Street law firms. Put simply, they were most unhappy with the New York Repub lican party: they couldn't abide the liberalism, “the pseudo‐Republican ism” of the Rockefeller‐Javits lead ership. Following the example of the Liberal party, they consciously saw themselves as a potential protest group, power bloc, and concentrated lobby, all in one. Just as the Liberal party was the tail that often wagged the Democratic donkey, they would be the driving wagger behind the Republican elephant. From their po sition in the rear they also viewed themselves as stern ideological con sciences, more interested in the maintenance of old and sacred prin ciples than in the accumulation of new soul‐selling power. Philosophically, the Conservative party has always espoused, more or less, the traditional conservative view of government—that less is bet ter than more, except when it comes to national defense, in which case more is better than less. Its first manifesto typically called for firm anti‐Communism and weak Federal and state government. Emphasizing “the private energies of individuals and nongovernmental associations,” it advocated lower taxes, less govern ment spending, an end to subsidies, and a return of the control of educa “'We're for self‐dependence, individual effort, hard work—all the square virtues,’ says Paul Adams candidate for Governor.” tion to “the parent and the local communities.” From those generally vague begin nings, the party has gone on, in pro grams and platforms, to take specific stands against Medicaid, civilian re view boards, fluoridation, across‐the board wage increases for state em ployes, increased state aid per pupil, school busing for racial balance, the Urban Development Corporation, rent controls, the 28‐year‐old vote, the new abortion law, and any proposal to legalize marijuana. The party is for a complete redirection and phasing down of both the welfare program and unemployment insurance, and the enactment of right‐to‐work legis lation to prohibit the closed shop and the union shop. It is also on record in favor of capital punishment, re ligious observances in the schools and the use of chemical Mace to con trol civil disorders, and opposed to gun control, the right of public em ployes to strike, the dissemination of pornography, the present state mini mum wage law, and a permissive at titude toward campus disruption. On an international level, the Conserva tives tend to veer to the right of the Agnew side of whatever position the Nixon Administration seems to be taking. In practical political terms, if the Liberal party has long set its sights on New York City patronage, the Conservative party has in a very short time successfully concentrated on securing clout in the State Legis lature. In 1968, for example, the State Assembly was made up, of 76 Republicans, 72 Democrats, and 2 Conservatives. Nine of the Repub licans owed their seats partly to the number of votes they had received on the Conservative party line; 24 more Republicans and a Democrat had also run with Conservative en dorsement. In the upcoming election, no fewer than 47 Republicans are also running on the Conservative line. Thus, a Conservative party balance of‐power role within the Republican majority of the State Assembly is al ready a recurring reality in Albany. Like all political parties, the Con servative organization is largely a shell, ready to be filled by the ballast of an election. Though it boasts 107, 372 enrolled voters and over 200 chartered clubs, it relies on a cadre of less than 2,000 faithful and active workers. Only five of these workers —the executive director, the treas urer, two secretaries, and an office boy at state headquarters—are paid; the rest are volunteers. But if it is folksy and populist in workaday op erations, the Conservative party, like the Liberal party, functions demo cratically only if viewed through a kind of Rose‐colored glasses. The party chieftains hand‐pick candidates in what can be duly described as Daley‐style, leadership‐controlled cau A FLAMING torch, emblazoned on its letterhead and the Row C vot inglever, is the logo of the conserva tive party in New York Perhaps a more valid, if less dramatic, symbol of the party could be one of the old oval, brown‐and‐white rotogravures of a life‐with‐father family. “We do believe, with a sense of nostalgia, in all the old American verities and values,” State Chairman Mahoney, one of the boyish founding fathers of the party, observed recently. “Our meetings have always started with the Pledge of Allegiance. We're not too sophisticated to take pride in our flag. And we're for self‐dependence, individual effort, hard work—all the square virtues. We're, you might say, for God, country and for Yale– in that order.” The God, country and Yale allusion is to the title of William F. Buckley's first book. And, of course, if the Conservatives boast a single well known adornment, it is the Buckley family, featuring William F., the high‐spirited ideological pinup boy and one‐time New York City mayoral candidate, and his ideally soft‐spoken, media‐cool brother, Jim. A further argument for a life‐with father daguerrotype as a party em blem is the fact that the 39‐year‐old Mahoney is often characterized by political opponents as the “Godfa ther” of an “Irish Mafia” family controlling the party. His brother in‐law Kieran O'Doherty, who is a state vice‐chairman and co‐founder of the party, is generally regard ed as one of its leading tac ticians and spokesmen. Another Ma honey brother‐in‐law, James E. O'Doherty, is the party's state treas urer. And Mahoney's wife, Kathleen, is never exactly retiring when it comes to voicing her opinions before party councils—or at family gather ings. But perhaps the best reason for a family ideograph would be the fact that the Conservative party simply likes to feel its basic appeal is to that typical American family out there in Middle New York. Indeed, the members of the party I inter viewed seem to exude such an aura of family that it sometimes al most became difficult to view these arch champions of individualism as individualists themselves. They were also family in a clan —and almost a Klannish—sense. One could coolly sense potentially disquieting vibrations beneath the glow of their genuine warmth. God help you if you could not accept their family as having a natural lock on all that is right and good and proper. God curse you if you ques tioned the propriety of their more extreme positions in any way. And, of course, there was no question that God was always on their side—be cause with the built‐in fallacy of cir cular logic — they self‐righteously concluded they were always on God's side. THE J. Daniel Mahoneys live in typically wholesome American, family type stone Tudor just a stone's throw from the new, ultramodern high school in suburban Mt. Vernon. Their furniture is practical, serviceable, and there are toys about the floor, tell tale marks of their five children. Paterfamilias Dan, bespectacled, pre maturely graying, sideburns high, hair close‐cropped James‐Buckley style, is a working lawyer who com mutes daily on the 8:13 to his job with a general practice law firm in New York City. But now, after hours, scholarly‐looking even in chinos, he sleepily sips a Scotch in the cozy, den nish family room, and discusses the Conservative party and its function. “The Conservative party stands for what the Republican party stands for naturally, at its better moments. We're struggling toward an honest two‐party system between liberals and conservatives on a national level. The liberals are strongest in the North east, in the cities, and among minor ity groups. The conservatives are strongest, in balance, among the not very‐rich, the not‐welfare poor, the “With Buckley, we play to win. With the rest of the ticket, we play a balance of‐power game,’ says the party chairman in Westchester.” not‐overly‐educated — among people who earn a wage and have to live on it. And just as the New Deal took certain aspirations and made them into a political philosophy, the Con servative challenge is to articulate what's out there now in Middle America, to develop an ideological and political structure around the sound instincts of these people.” He describes Buckley, a registered Republican, as a Middle American who, in New York State at least, has found his logical—and ideological— home. Why then, I ask, is Buckley also running his own separate cam paign on an independent line as the candidate of something called the In dependent Alliance party? Mahoney nods, as if he's been ex pecting the question: “First, why shouldn't Jim have two lines on the ballot the way Charlie Goodell has as a Republican and Liberal? Second, Jim's appeal—and ours, hopefully—is broad‐based enough to attract Demo crats, too. There are Democrats who are also militant ideological conserva tives, you knows Third, since Jim has a real shot at winning, he needs an organization which can spend time and money on his campaign exclu sively. We just don't have the setup.” “Look, let's face it,” he leans for ward, the professional politican eager to discuss his trade. “Last year we thought we had the ideal scenario in New York City: a conservative run ning against two liberals for Mayor. But then Wagner got upset in the Democratic primary [won by Mario Procaccino]. So we were left holding the script. But this year we're sit ting where we wanted to be last year. Only better.… “Charlie Goodell isn't a Lindsay— or a Javits. He doesn't fit that pat tern. He has no history as a strong vote‐getter. He has no acceptance as a Republican. He doesn't appeal particularly to the Jewish vote….” But does Buckley, or for that mat ter, the Conservative party, hold any appeal for the Jewish vote, so crucial in a New York election? “How to get the Jewish vote?” Ma honey drums his fingers against the armrest as though it is a question he is mulling over for the first time. “Difficult. Difficult for us. Some people say it's because we have too many R.C.'s going for us.” R.C.'s? “Republican‐Conservative. And Ro man Catholic. Anyway, Buckley and Paul Adam's, our candidate for Gov ernor, who's a Methodist by the way —neither of these candidates is go ing to scare anybody away. And I think the feeling of disintegration and breakdown in the country is now shared by the Jews. It's one thing to be liberal when it means you're for decent working conditions. But it's another thing to be liberal when the Left, in its every visible manifes tation, is going nuts: Blowing build ings up. Campus disorders. Not finding anything worth salvaging in American society.” Somehow Mahoney has obviously drifted into a set campaign‐speech peroration: “And there is real con cern with the whole notion of taxing and spending. People are sick of being squeezed. And for what? A lot of liberal sacred cows: Welfare. Education. Every year in this state education automatically gets more money. Look at the Taj Ma hal down the road“—he re fers to the nearby high school —“Indoor track. Swimming pool,” he snorts. “We're for a more down‐to‐earth look at all that state spending.” Kathleen Mahoney comes in with coffee and cake. Our talk becomes more informal. “The liberal press,” she complains, “always pictures us as some kind of bigots. And it isn't so. We have a strong feeling for Negroes and their problems. Within our group there is an awareness that certain mi nority groups have been ig nored. And there is a sense of charity on our part” She puts down the steaming coffee pot. “But we don't want law and order overturned for any rea sons, though.” LESS than a dozen blocks from the Mahoneys, in a stucco Tudor house in the Glenwood Lake neighborhood of New Rochelle, along with a French‐Canadian wife who calls him “cheri,” two sons, two daughters, one large dog, two cats, a tankful of fish, a few assorted hamsters and a baby alligator, lives Ed Leon ard. The party candidate for Lieutenant Governor is an en rolled Conservative. Since both Buckley and guberna torial hopeful Paul Adams are registered Republicans, this makes him, at least theo retically, the top Conservative candidate in the state. Leonard, 45 years old, who looks like a George Murphyish Ronald Reagan, and blows both a jazz clarinet and sax, seems to be standing up well under the pressures of run ning for a Throttlebottomish office on a third‐party ticket. A professor of political sci ence at nearby Iona College, he is maintaining a full‐time teaching schedule through a campaign which, evenings and weekends, often finds him handing out his own press re leases. Now he is relaxing in his easy chair in the family living room, near the fire place, under a vividly realistic mural of a Latin scene paint ed by a former neighbor. How does he get about the state, I ask—in a chartered plane? He looks at me to see if I’m putting him on. “No,” he smiles. “I travel by plastic. I have two airline credit cards.” Why was he running for office? Certainly he didn't think he had a chance of win ning? “I could say as a student of history that I know that po litical upsets happen,” he says, pouring shots of Scotch for both of us, “but the reason rm running is that I'm in volved in the party and, if you're serious about it, even tually you have to do your duty and become a candidate. “I've been a Democrat and a Republican, but I couldn't find a conservative bone in either of those two parties that wasn't sat on. And I'm not just running for this year. We're not just around until tomorrow. We plan to keep on until we can effect a con servative change in both the Democratic and Republican parties. “We're not gadflies, you know, even though it's worked to our advantage to have our enemies consider us as such. They've never taken us seri ously.” He smiles again: “Just because we're ideological, they can't imagine we're also interested in power.” But how can the Conserva tives hope to achieve real power, as opposed to a bal ance of power, without ap pealing to minority groups? What have they to offer the black community, for ex ample? “We can offer them a lot, but they're not hearing our message yet. People have all sorts of notions about Con servatives. I live in an inte grated community. That house across the street is owned by a Negro family. But in a short time Negroes of the kind who live in this neighborhood— middle class, working class— are going to begin to support their white counterparts in the Conservative party. Be cause we have no fat cats, we have no labor leaders. Their interests will be the same as ours. “Take property values, for example, which are basic. If the individual isn't educated to respect property values then he can't have respect for individual values. In this suburban community, rm con stantly after my own kids not to run on neighbors’ property and mess it up. If I don't get after the kids on that score, they're certainly not going to have any respect for human rights. “I had the same thing taught to me as a kid in the Depression. I grew up in the Bronx on Kingsbridge Ave nue. I used to play stickball in the same schoolyard with Paddy Chayefsky. My father was a poor man, a cabbie. We had a $36‐a‐month apartment. “A man named Resnick owned the building. And that man came and he dealt with my father on a position of equality. Resnick would come to the door and stand outside. As long as my father paid that pitiful rent, the apartment was his. “And the same way, my father would get after me if I'd be rough on the bathroom fixtures. He'd say: ‘It's not ours. It belongs to Resnick.’ And so the fixtures were kept up. The hallways were kept up. The building was kept up. The neighborhood was kept up. “The trouble with the po litical leaders we have today is that they lack those values; those values have slipped by them. Schools, colleges, the complete educational system, whole sections of the city, law enforcement, morals— they are not being kept up. Nothing's being kept up.” PHILOSOPHY is to politics as sonnets are to sex, and the Conservative party, if ideo logically fueled, is still no body's fool in practical terms. Indeed, as a political vehicle, it is no Kantian bearer of pure reason but rather a Jamesian mass of pragmatic inconsis tencies. For example, if in public statements it likes to boast that it is above the usual ethnic considerations, its candidate for Controller clearly is not above invoking his own ethnic composition. In the same way, the party can advocate a strict govern ment hands‐off policy in an area such as control of guns, and favor firm government in tervention in an area such as the censorship of pornography. The Conservative party, too, for all of its high sense of avowed purpose, has been accused of relishing the down and, dirty game of partici patory politics. “Who says they don't make deals? Who says they never peddle en dorsements?” says Ed Katch er, formerly one of New York's most knowledgeable political reporters and now a top Goldberg aide. “Dan Ma honey and Kieran O'Doherty are familiar with the instru ment known as a telephone. They know how to place a call, how to pick up a receiver when it rings, and how to be out to certain callers when they phone.” “I can tell you from per sonal experience,” says par tisan Peter A. Peyser, an or ganizational Republican lead er running for the Congres sional seat Ottinger is vacat ing in Wilson Price's county, “that despite all their high minded utterances the leaders of the Conservative party in my district are far more in terested in advancing them selves as political power brokers than they are in pro moting the good of the coun try. “Just look at my situation: Pm opposed by a Liberal, a Democrat who claims that he is more liberal than the Lib eral, and a Conservative. The Conservative can't hope to win. All he can do is draw votes from me. The Demo crat and the Liberal both op pose President Nixon's pro grams. I support the President and the President has per sonally endorsed me. The Conservative leaders piously proclaim that they want to send Nixon supporters to Congress knowing full well that every vote my Conserva tive opponent gets is in effect a vote against President Nixon.” ON 38th Street and Madi son Avenue, a storefront that previously housed John Lind say and Robert Kennedy cam paign operations is the Buck ley‐for‐Senator headquarters. A large sign outside featuring an American flag, proclaims “Buckley” in big red letters, and sloganizes: “Join the March for America.” Within, highly visible, are kids no dif ferent at least in clean, shaggy appearance from those who worked for Lindsay or Ken nedy; they are making phone calls, assembling lists, corre lating mimeographed litera ture. But behind makeshift, sheet rock partitions is a high ly professional staff headed by F. Clifton White, who masterminded the Goldwater nomination‐getting campaign in 1964. Indeed, White is so professional that he is also supporting Nelson Rockefeller for Governor. This has tended to add credence to the rumor that the Rocky forces and the an “understanding”; the two candidates will pay attention to their own races, neither will boldly campaign against the other, and, it is hoped, the supporters of each will know in their hearts it is right to vote for both. At the state Conservative party headquarters on Park Avenue, James D. Griffin, the pink‐faced, graying executive director of the party, dis misses those rumors, waving a piece of paper “Look at all the joint appearances we schedule for Adams and Buck ley before Conservative groups. It's important for us to win Row C again. A big Adams vote makes a point— it's a message to Albany. But we're such a shoestring opera tion — our budget is maybe $105,000 a year — that Jim Buckley has to have a sepa rate office for efficiency. “Also, he has to try to reach out into the rural areas, where we have no real or ganizational strength at all. We're strictly strongest in the suburbs and the cities. I ask what the Conservative party stand is on the John Birch Society. “We have no official stand. There are some Birchers who are in the Conservative par ty. But we're not a bunch of right‐wing kooks, as the media make us out to be. We're not the sort of people who look for a conspiracy under every bed. We talk about realities.” Are there any blacks or Puerto Ricans, I ask, on the state executive committee or on any county executive com mittee of the Conservative party? He shakes his head: “No.” THE chief spoke in a party organizational wheel is the county chairman.

Tough‐Minded Canadian,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/19/archives/toughminded-canadian-pierre-elliott-trudeau.html,"OTTAWA, Oct. 18—A few weeks after the Soviet‐led invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, Pierre Elliott Tru deau, the new Prime Min ister was asked to de fend his decision to phase Canada militarily out of the North Atlantic alliance. “I am less worried about what might happen In Man Berlin than in Chicago or New in the York,” he replied. News “If in the next half‐dozen years or so, there were to be great riots and the beginnings of civil war in the United States, there is no doubt that they would overflow the bor ders and link up with under privileged Mexicans and Canadians.” The Prime Minister's off the‐cuff depiction of what he considered the chief threat to Canada made headlines across the country and was frequently cited as an ex ample of Mr. Trudeau's char acteristic candor and his de sire to provoke public dis cussion. But most Canadians continued to think that this was still a land of secure refuge for the world's troubled people, Including hundreds of young Ameri cans fleeing the draft and military service in Vietnam. Today, the Prime Minister rode to Parliament Hill in a bullet‐proof limousine under the protection of a federal trooper for an emergency meeting of his Cabinet. He had assumed wartime emer gency powers to cope with an “insurrection” in Quebec, and had the news that Pierre Laporte, a high Quebec offi cial abducted by terrorists to promote the cause of Quebec separatism, had been mur dered. A second victim of kidnapping, James R. Cross, a British trade commissioner, was reported to be alive. Criticized From Both Sides Today, his 51st birthday, Mr. Trudeau found himself being criticized from both right and left for assuming powers that give him dicta torial authority to attain democratic ends. But no one, the Prime Min ister says in effect, knows the nature of the threat from the extremist Front for the Liberation of Quebec better than he, a Quebecker, and, he insists, brute force must be met with brute force. Mr. Trudeau was born in Montreal on Oct. 18, 1919, of well‐to‐do parents. His French‐speaking father, Charles‐Emile Trudeau, was a successful businessman and his mother, the former Grace Elliott, came from a Scottish French family of means and education. He attended French‐speaking classes at the Jesuit college of Jean de Breboeuf in Montreal, and went on to graduate studies at the University of Mont real, Harvard, the London School of Economics and the University of Paris. As a restless student and lawyer, Mr. Trudeau de veloped into an impatient reformer. With fellow critics he established a monthly re view, Cite Libre (Community of the Free) to attack the archaic Quebec political re gime of Premier Maurice Dupiessis. He demanded, too, an end to the grip of the ultra conservative Roman Catholic clergy in Quebec's schools. Mr. Trudeau was an Im portant figure in Quebec's “quiet revolution,” the re form movement of the early nineteen‐sixties. But in 1965 he joined the cause of fed eralism and the Liberal party, led by Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson, parting ways with Quebec nationalist associates who increasingly advocated separatism. Today Mr. Trudeau's clos est friends and advisers are two fellow Quebeckers who came to Ottawa with him as freshmen Members of Parlia ment five years ago: Jean Marchand, Minister of Re gional Development, who was once Quebec's strongest labor leader, and Gerard Pel letier, a former Montreal journalist, who is Mr. Tru deau's Secretary of State. Mr. Pelletier is in charge of one of the Prime Minister's highest priority programs, that to guarantee the cul tural and language rights of French Canadians every where in the country. Fluent In 2 Languages When Mr. Pearson decided to retirre in late 1987, Mr. Marchand, then Minister of Immigration, was generally regarded as the most likely representative of Quebec In the race for the Liberal lead ership. But Mr. Marchand, pleading poor health and lack of familiarity with the English language, pressed the role of Quebec's favorite son on his fluently bilingual colleague, Mr. Trudeau, then Minister of Justice. Mr. Trudeau at the time was nationally known on the basis of one remark in the Commons. Arguing for amend ments to the Criminal Code to liberalize laws on abortion and homosexuality, he said: “The Government has no place in the bedrooms of the nation.” But his dashing style and wit and his dis arming approach to politics, helped win the party leader ship and the Prime Minister ship over a field of prominent English Canadians. A bachelor, he retains his fondness for the compan ionship of attractive wo men. He has dated Barbra Streisand on visits to New York, and has invited her to Ottawa twice.

Y., Oct. 19—The City Council unani mously passed an ordinance tonight providing that out‐of hospital abortions here may be performed only in highly equipped and staffed clinics. The measure is effective im mediately because it was adopted unanimously. The ordinance, similar to one that went into effect in New York City today, was adopted in response to plans by six Detroit doctors to open an out patient clinic here for women from the Midwest under the liberalized New York State abortion law that went into effect July I. The state law does not dictate where an abortion may be performed. Under the Detroit doctors’ plan, a woman would have re ceived an abortion, round‐trip transportation and lodgings and meals while here for $400. The new ordinance provides that an abortion must be per formed “where there is quali fied supervision in obstetrics or surgery and where equipment, staff and facilities are provided to handle hemorrhage, shock, cardiac arrest and other emer gencies.” Also required in the facility are a blood bank and clinical and X‐ray laboratories. Any abortion facility over one story in height must have an elevator under the new measure. The center planned by the Detroit group would have been two stores without an elevator. Spokesmen fort the Detroit group amid not be reached aft er the ordinance was adopted, and it was not immediately clear what their plans might be in view of the new measure. A group called the Concerned Citizens Against Abortion Mills had fostered opposition to their plan. City Manager Morton H. Abramowitz, in urging adoption of the restrictive measure, said tonight that he did not want the city, traditionally a honey mooners’ haven, to become known “as an abortion center.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"New Abortion Rules Take Effeet, Complicating Confused Picture",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/20/archives/new-abortion-rules-take-effect-complicating-confused-picture-new.html,"New city regulations forbid ding abortions in doctors’ of fices and clinics lacking certain medical equipment took effect yesterday amid controversy and confusion over the ability of already overburdened hospi tals to handle the demand for abortions. A three‐week survey By The New York Times that includ ed interviews with dozens of doctors, administrators and pa tients disclosed that the road to a hospital abortion often in cluded seeming endless delays, clerical errors, complicated pro cedures, high costs and gratui tous psychological trauma. Faced with such difficulties, many women — especially the poor, poorly educated, timid, embarrassed, frightened and unaggressive—are finding hospital abortions ampossible to obtain. The ban on operations in of fices is expected to further re duce the availability of abor tions here. Many city doctors already had stopped doing of fice abortions in anticipation of the regulations, which call for sentences up to a year in jail and fines up to $1,000 for vio lations. But some doctors said they were thinking of moving to the suburbs where office abortions are still permitted. The two independent clinics affected by the regulations — the Women's Medical Center and the Women's Medical Group—said they were prepar ing to install expensive equip ment to meet the new requirements including X‐ray and an esthesia machines, resuscitators and laboratory facilities li censed hospitals are not affect ed by the new regulations. Dr. Mary McLaughlin, the city's Health. Commissioner, said yesterday that the Board of Health's decision to prom ulgate the regulations was based on its “impression that hospitals could handle the de mand for abortions, especially if they restrict them to New York City residents.” She added that the “compli cation rate associated with hos pital abortions seemed serious enough to warrant doing them, in hospitals for the safety of the women involved.” However, physicians critical of the new regulations have charged that the board acted before any evaluations had been made of the relative safety of hospital abortions compared with those one in clinics or offices, and before the hospitals ability to handle the load had been carefully assessed. “The system isn't working,” Dr. Richard Hausknecht, an obstetrician at Mount Sinai and Elmhurst Hospitals, remarked at a public hearing last week. “The hospital Waiting lists are getting longer, not shorter, the hospitals are unable and unwilling to provide, compas sionate service for the abortion patient and the profiteering is unbelievable.” More than 30,000 women have received abortions in New York City since July 1, when the State law took effect. The exact number is not known since many doctors, particulars ly those performing abortions in their offices, have not filed the required “termination of pregnancy” certificates. City hospital statistics indi cate, however, that the new law has done little to reduce the number of “back‐alley” abor thins. As many women as erer are being admitted to city hos pitals after botched, presumably unprofessional, abortions. Many of the problems that have surrounded hospital abortions have been recorded by Clergy and Lay Advocates for Hospital Abortion Perfor mance, a complaint service directed by the, Rev. Howard Moody, pastor of Judson Memorial church. The follow ing are typical of the more than 1,000 complaints re ceived: ¶A 20‐year‐old Brooklyn woman want to a city hospital three days a row and each time was told to come back the next day. On her fourth visit, She was told that the hospital was filled add she couldn't be given an appointment. ¶A woman who was 10 weeks pregnant when ex amined at dings County Hos pital on Sept. 22 was sched uled for abortion on Dec. 4, her 21st week, although the hospital was not doing abor tions beyond the 16th week of pregnancy. ¶A 17‐year‐old Brooklyn girl who applied at a municipal hospital when she was nine weeks pregnant and still able to get a simple one‐day $160 abor tion was given an appointment for an examination six weeks later. She was then told she would have to pay $325 in ad vance for the more complicated abortion she then required. ¶A low‐income mother of three was given this oversim plified explanation of the abor tion she was about to receive: “We stick a needle in your belly to kill the baby.” ¶A mother of two was emo tionally shattered when, upon admission to a voluntary hos pital, she was asked to sign a fetal death certificate as “ma ternal parent of the deceased.” Other problems that have beset hospital abortions have included the hospitals’ frequent failure to use the Health De partmentes clearing house to place patients promptly in hos pitals that can serve them, the adverse psychological effects of placing abortion patients on the same floor with mothers and their newborn babies, the lack Of a uniform hospital policy governing parental consent for minors, and periodic changes in how late in pregnancy a par ticular hospital will allow an abortion to be performed. “When one considers that prior to the new law, the abor tions performed in city hospi tals numbered in the hundreds,” a Brooklyn obstetrician ob aerved, “it is nothing short of a miracle that the hospitals have served so many thousands of abortion patients in the last few months. “But the fact remains that hospitals are no place for abor tions, at least not for the sim ple, early ones. The entire hos pital setup — with its involved bureaucracy, administrative de lays, high overhead and brus que efficiency — only sery es to make abortions more costly, more complicated and more traumatic for the patient.” This doctor, and many others who have dealt with aborton patients since July, looks for ward to the day when abor tions during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy can be performed in specialized clinics, with hos pitals reserved for late‐in‐preg nancy procedures and those complicated by maternal ill ness. The Women's Medical Group, under the direction of Dr. Hale Harvey, is the only outpatient abortion facility in New York that has kept careful records of complications that have en sued. Thus far, Dr. Harvey re ported last week, there have been no deaths and only three hospitalizations required among more than 4,000 abortion pa tipnts. The complication rate for all patients has been 0.6 per cent, and 0.3 per cent in pregnancies of less than 12 weeks. In New York City hospitals there have been four deaths associated with hospital abor tions and the complication rate has been 1.0 per cent in pregnancies less than 12 weeks. There has been one reported death following an abortion in the office of a physician. Lawrence Lader, chairman of the National Association for th Repeal of Abortion Laws, prediets that by “locking abor tions into the hospital system” the Board of Health will merely encourage the profiteering that has already become extensive throughout the city. Park East Hospital, for in stance, a private hospital that has turned over 50 of its 118 beds to abortions, charges $575 for a simple early abortion done on an outpatient basis. Flower and Fifth Avenue Hospital, a voluntary facility, charges $450 for the late‐inpregnancy salting‐out proce dure, which in most cases in volves only an overnight hos pital stay. To the hospital cost, the patient must add the doc tor's fee, which usually runs around $300 to $400. It appears to Mr. Lader, who fought for New York's new abortion law for a decade, that changing the law has done little to change the punitive attitudes, fears, profiteering, endless’ searching and red tape that have always been asso ciated with abortions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/22/archives/letters-to-the-editor.html,"Overconsumption of Fuels To the Editor: Joseph C. Swidler, Chairman of the New York State Public Service Com mission, deals with the expected fuel shortage this winter (letter Oct. 15). In many ways his assessment of the situation was a balanced and thought ful one, dealing with delays in the Department of the Interior, fading competition among oil companies, oil import quotas and a number of other contributory factors. Like most public debate on this and other subjects, however, Mr. Swidler's letter and the previous ones to which he refers never get to the heart of the problem: the overpopulated, over developed American cowboy economy. Americans are already consuming a wildly disproportionate share of the world's fuel and other resources. Even the most generous estimates of energy resources point to mounting costs and perpetual “crises,” with potential pro duction actually peaking before the end of this century. Indeed, we may soon price the non industrial, poorer nations out of the international fuel market by our in creased demand (leading to increased prices). The best estimate of the carrying capacity of the world on a cyclic economy that I have seen points to a maximum world population of 100 million people. Even assuming that the world could support ten times that population because of continued sci entific break‐throughs—and many sci entists feel these are likely to be more limited than we often think—clearly we have to start thinking about dif ferent solutions to fuel shortages than ever more rapid exploitation of avail able reserves. Rising gross national product has become a deity for economists, and its individual equivalent (higher incomes) performs a similar function for most of the rest of us. At some point we have to realize that we cannot keep having more if we expect the world to still be functioning 100 or 500 years from now. When will we learn? EDWARD J. WOODHOUSE New Haven, Oct. 15, 1970 Veto of TV Curb Backed To the Editor: Lawrence O'Brien's denunciations to the contrary [news story, Oct. 13], President Nixon's veto of the bill limit ing radio‐television campaign spending arose from genuine concern over its inequities, not from politics. Politically, the veto has given Democrats a rallying cry against “rich” Republicans, despite the fact that the bill did not apply to the current elec tion. Certainly there is time to pass a better bill for 1972. Additionally, many Democrats will benefit substantially from the veto. When one thinks of “big campaign spenders” in this 1970 race (one in which the Democratic party is sup posedly impoverished), one immedi ately thinks of Richard Ottinger (New York), Howard Metzenbaum (Ohio), and Lloyd Bentsen (Texas), all Demo crats, and all triumphant in their primaries because of excessive spend ing on television advertising. Since the President cannot possibly benefit politically from his veto, the voter should listen seriously to his stated reasons for the veto. The bill was a poor one. It put no monetary limit on campaigns generally, and so allowed huge sums simply to be diverted from T.V. into other media. Also, the vetoed bill discriminated against the urban candidate who could buy much less time (due to much higher rates) than his rural opponent. Further, in limiting only paid television exposure, the bill favored incumbents and celebrity candidates who would command free T.V. news coverage. Many other reasons, all equally valid, were advanced by President Nixon to explain his veto. Once again Democrats had decided to jump into a “popular” issue without examining its practical consequences, from which the President's veto has now saved us. ROBERT C. HAWTHORNE Chairman, Virginia Young Americans for Freedom Richmond, Va., Oct. 15, 1970 Speeches as Rhetoric To the Editor: For the past several months there has been an increasing tendency to describe political utterances and speeches as rhetoric. This very fine word, meaning the art of prose com position, now faces the likelihood, of being eviscerated through overuse: divisive rhetoric, inflammatory rhet oric, my rhetoric, and as a general noun for all speeches. If politicians and the news media want to make household words out of unknown names, that is one thing; but please, leave rhetoric in semi‐obscurity so that when it is needed it will have some validity. JOHN L. RUTHERFORD Ridgewood, N. J., Oct. 16, 1970 Plan to End War Questioned To the Editor: The President's latest proposals on Vietnam have been widely accepted by many expert commentators as repre senting a useful, or at least potentially useful, contribution to a negotiated peace. It is difficult for a less sophis ticated observer to understand this point of view. If the enemy were to accept a cease fire on the basis of our claims to 92 per cent of the population, or any where near that figure, it would be tantamount to a formal acceptance of defeat. I suggest that any optimism gen erated by these proposals is illusory. LEONARD SCHAEFFER Ridgewood, N. J., Oct. 13, 1970 To Revitalize the U.N. To the Editor: As national states are finding them selves helpless before hijacking of air planes, it is interesting to note that attention is being turned to the neces sity for taking some sort of interna tional action that will put a stop to these outrages. Since the United Na tions is the only world organization of any consequence, it is only natural that attention should be directed to “ ward it to see what can be done about the matter; and this despite the low repute to which the United Nations has fallen in recent years because of its ineffectiveness. Unfortunately, the United Nations, in its present form, is not in a posi tion to act in such a matter any more than it is in putting a stop to the Vietnam war. For years this interna tional organization has been fairly crying for a restructuring of its Char ter so that it could accomplish the high purposes for which it was found ed. Yet in all these years nothing has been done about the matter. It would be ironic enough If an insidious practice like hijacking could at last arouse the public opinion of the world to begin to move in this di rection, something that the threat of war in a nuclear age has long been lin able to accomplish. It would indeed be a welcome development should it occur. As the United Nations observes its 25th anniversary, what could be a bet ter time for launching such a move ment? That national governments are no longer able to cope with interna tional problems today is a common place observation of the present era. Yet the United Nations is still organ ized on the basis of preserving national sovereignties. It is one thing to say that the United Nations Charter needs to be revised; it is quite another thing to show how this is to be done. Fortunately, this is not a serious problem at the present time, nor has it been so for the past dozen years. It is nothing short of a national dis grace, and even an international dis grace for that matter, that so little has been done in bringing to fruition this great accomplishment of Grenville Clark and Louis B. Sohn in their monu mental work, “World Peace Through World Law.” In it they have taken up the United Nations Charter and rewrit ten it, article by article, so that, when adopted, the United Nations, instead of being something to be scoffed at, will become something to be looked up to as man's best hope for survival in a truly civilized world. NORMAN BOARDMAN New York, Oct. 19, 1970 Encouraging Population To the Editor: Assuming that L. Brent Bozell's opinions (“Encouraging Murder,” Op. Ed. column Oct. 14) are serious and not satirical, one must challenge them. Unborn babies are clinically and legally, but not emotionally or con sciously alive; therefore, they are not “innocent children.” The real, innocent victims in this scenario are the preg nant women who for their own good and personal reasons seek an abortion but run up against dogmatic, unin formed prejudices. Mr. Bozell apparently feels no con cern for the quality of human life. Rather he has an unthinking faith in numbers and therefore no qualms about the relentlessly growing popula tion of the world‐. (On what basis does Mr. Bozell believe that “the initial scare of environmental apocalypse is over”?) I should think that his article may actually serve to arouse rebellious indignation in those not’ previously open‐minded about the Inter‐related issues of abortion, women's rights and overpopulation. Perhaps Mr. Bozell's attitude to ward abortion stems from his medie val concept of women as inferior human beings, for his description, in sulting in the extreme, of a woman who visits a beauty parlor after casually undergoing an abortion which under the best of circumstances is a harrowing emotional experience— reveals his ignorance of every aspect of abortion and his antipathy towards the sanctity of (woman's) life. FREDERICK D. HILL New York, Oct. 14, 1970 Society's Values To the Editor: L. Brent Bozell's language was pow erful and direct, and although we're sure not everyone who advocates pop ulation control and abortion on de mand is consciously aware that his reasons for such feelings might be pre cisely those Mr. Bozell sets forth in his column, we're sure he gave all of us something to think about. He laid it on the line and told it as it is. It's about time. We heed his warnings, and we can't help wonder what are the true and real values of our society. MURIEL T. BLTRON MARION GILLESPIE Carteret, N. J., Oct. 14, 1970 Gibson's Stand on Contest To the Editor: In your editorial of Oct. 19, refer ring to endorsements of Congres sional candidates in the state of New Jersey, you indicated that I had en dorsed the candidacy of James Shue for the Eleventh Congressional Dis trict of New Jersey. That is not true. In fact, I have endorsed no candidates for national office. (Mayor) KENNETH A. GIBSON Newark, Oct. 19, 1970 [The statement was a slip. It was Can didate Shue who endorsed Mr. Gibson for Mayor, not the other way around. —Editor, The Times.] Granting Vote to Eighteen‐Year‐Olds To the Editor: The Supreme Court finds itself in a “Catch‐22” situation whether it likes it or not with the pending decision on the constitutionality of the eight een‐year‐old voting provision in the Voting Rights Bill. If the Court upholds the provision it may well open Pandora's box far wider than just the privilege to allow eighteen to twenty‐year‐olds to vote in all Federal, state, and local elections. As bona fide electors, shouldn't eighteen to twenty‐year‐olds be en titled to all the rights, privileges, and immunities granted electors now 21 in their respective states? Drink at eighteen? Drive at eighteen? Marry at eighteen? All age of majority rights? For if they can vote in all elections don't they deserve the same privileges and rights granted their fellow electors? What if the Court upholds the provision with a narrow, split deci sion? What if Congress at a later date decides, perhaps for political reasons, that passing the legislation wasn't great idea after all? (What the Con gress grants, the Congress can also take away.) What if another Court with a different prevailing philosophy finds the provision “unconstitutional”? Should a segment of our electorate exist under such tenuous grounds? Although the Constitution specifi cally guarantees the 21‐year‐old voting age minimum in numerous places, nowhere does it prohibit the lowering of the voting age. Eighteen‐year‐olds have been voting in Federal elections in Georgia, for example, since 1944. In hindsight it seems to me that Georgia erred in believing that by lowering its voting age to eighteen it included Federal elections as well. Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amend ment (1868) states that “No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immu nities of citizens of the United States….” But this is precisely what Georgia did in this instance since its action automatically deprived citizens in other states (eighteen to twenty year‐olds) of their equal protection. Thus, if the Court does not uphold the Voting Rights Bill eighteen‐year old voting provision, what is to pre vent one from suing in behalf of his daughter or son under this reasoning to obtain the same end? It behooves the Supreme Court to reach its decision, whatever it may be, with unanimity to at least eliminate the doubt, confusion, and ramifications that could easily arise from a very dubious and weakly supported decision.

"Indira Gandhi Has Never Regretted Being a Woman …Well, Almost Never",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/23/archives/indira-gandhi-has-never-regretted-being-a-woman-well-almost-never.html,"Mrs. Indira Gandhi, who has gone about as far in life as a woman—or man, for that matter—can go, isn't losing much sleep these nights over women's libera tion. “I don't think of people as being men or women,” she said yesterday. “I just think of them as people. Every person has some male and female in them. What's important is their compe tency.” Mrs. Gandhi, 52‐year‐old Prime. Minister of 550 million Indians, spoke at an im promptu press conference at Sona, an Indian handicraft and fashion shop, at 11 East 55th Street. She is here to attend cere monies marking the 25th anniversary of the United Nations. This morning she will address a special gather ing of the General Assembly, and she will return to India tomorrow. Concept of Leadership Mrs. Gandhi, dressed in a yellow and burnt orange silk sari and carrying an orange patent leather handbag, said that when it came to dealing with world leaders, she had no preference as to whether they were male or female. “My theory is that men are no more liberated than women,” she said. “I sup pose leadership at one time meant muscle, but today it means getting along with people.” She said the only time in her life that she had ever regretted being a woman was “before I was 16, because thought boys had more fun climbing trees.” Indira Priyadarshini Gan dhi, whose middle name means “beautiful to behold,” is a small (5 foot 1‐inch), handsome woman with silver threads zigzagging through her black hair. Her father was Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister of India for. 17 years, who led India from colonialism to independence after World War II. Popular With Masses She became Prime Minis ter in January, 1966, and al though she is a frequent tar get of critics in both right and left wings of her Con gress Party, she is popular among the masses. One of the greatest prob lems she has faced is India's high rate of growth—rough ly a million people a month —which she said is not so much due to a soaring birth rate as it is to a rapidly de clining death rate. She recently announced that the birth rate had come down to 39 per 1,000, com pared with 42 per 1,000 ten years ago. Her goal for 1980 is to bring it down to 25 per 1,000. She said she thought that her country's family plan ning programs were “un even,” but she added that she believed prevention of pregnancy was a much bet ter answer for her country than abortion. Mrs. Gandhi was asked if her presence at the United Nations anniversary indi cated her support of that oft‐maligned world body. “You would have to have some international agency where people get together to hammer out their difficul ties,” she said. “It hasn't been very successful, but think we should keep trying to make it a success.” Mrs. Gandhi was married at the age of 25 to Feroze Gandhi, a young Congress Party legislator. Although they were once greatly in love, their marriage could not survive the strains that grew with her father's increasing prominence. By the early nineteen‐fifties, Mrs. Gandhi was devoting more time and attention to her father than to her husband, who died in 1960. She has two sons, Rajiv, 26, a pilot with Indian Air lines (“His work doesn't wor ry me,” she said), and Sanjay, 23, an automotive engineer. No Midi Problems The Prime Minister, who wears nothing but saris, “ex cept for the few occasions when I go horseback riding,” hasn't been caught up in the mini — midi hassle that is plaguing so many countries in the Western world. “What's nice about now is that people can choose what they want to wear,” she said, as incense wafted through the room, adding an authen tic Indian touch to the color ful shop. She said that she no longer had time for two of her for mer favorite pastimes: yoga exercises and movies. As for yoga, “I'm getting too lazy,” she said. On movies: “I'm the kind of person who won't go to just any movie. It has to be a good movie, and haven't seen one for ages.” Mrs. Gandhi's job has fre quently been called “the sec ond most difficult in the world,” after the American Presidency. Her problems are innumerable, and many of them seem at times to be unsolvable. Can she really say that she likes being Prime Minister? Her lips curved into slight smile. “I've been trained since I was a tot to like what I'm doing,” she re plied. “If I didn't, I would leave it. It's a tremendous challenge, because there is so much to be done.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wilson and Paterson Aid Running Mates,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/23/archives/wilson-and-paterson-aid-running-mates.html,"Both major‐party candidates for Lieutenant Governor are bringing strength to their run ning mates for Governor, while statewide contests for Attorney General and Controller have brought up differing concepts about those offices. For Lieutenant Governor, Ba sil A. Paterson, 44 years old, a State Senator since 1966, is drawing votes, particularly, from among fellow blacks in his Democratic‐Liberal candi dacy with Arthur J. Goldberg for Governor. Governor Rocke feller had won a third of the Harlem and Bedford‐Stuyve sant vote in 1962 and 1966. Malcolm Wilson, 56, Lieuten ant Governor for 12 years, has been rallying Republican loyal ists for his joint Republican ballot with the Governor. Mr., Rockefeller has been a special target for Republican dissi dents, who have a Conserva tive party alternative. The No. 2 nominees have contrasting personalities. Mr. Wilson calls himself “a fiscal conservative and human rights, liberal.” He operates largely behind the scenes — an influ ential adviser to the Governor, a legislative liaison. Mr. Paterson has been forceful legislative leader for divorce and abortion law re form. He says the’ Lieutenant Governor should be “the ad ministration's eyes and ears for the people.” Economy an Issue The “biggest issue,” Mr. Pat erson says, is the state's eco nomic condition, with pockets of unemployment as high as per cent. He says state re sources should he going into housing, rather than offices. He pledges a Democratic adminis tration to provide drug treat ment by June 1 for “every eligible addict who wants to be treated.” Mr. Wilson retorts that the Rockefeller administration has improved the state's economic climate so that nearly 7,500 new factories or expansions of existing plants have started since 1959, and jobs have risen by 945,000 to 8,130,000. The Lieutenant Governor, who says he sponsored 432 bills during his 20 years as an Azsemblyman, is calling for continuation of Republican ex ecutive and legislative “team work government.” When Democrats controlled the As sembly and Senate in 1865, he said, the Legislatur, lost more than a month in wranglinl over leadership. Mr. Wilson has also been campaigning to aid Senate and Assembly candidates. Paterson on the other hand, has campaigned mostly by himself on the theory this helps the Democrats cover more ground. In the other statewide races, re‐election is being sought by Louis J. Lefkowitz, 66, Repub lican Attorney General since 1957, and Arthur Levitt, 70, Democratic Controller since 1955. Both also have Liberal party nominations. Adam Walinsky, 33, former aide to the late Senator Robert F. Kennedy, is Democratic nom inee for Attorney General. Ed ward V. Regan, 40, Buffalo Councilman from 1965 to 1969 and owner of the Bison Liquor Company, is Republican candi date for Controller. Mr. Walinsky contends the Attorney General's office should be more active against crime, cracking down on narcotics traffic and violations of labor, oollution, tax and antidiscrim ination laws. He says it now operates in “traditional fash ion.” Mr. Lefkowitz insists he has pioneered with consumer, civil rights and environmental pro tection bureaus. He says his office has obtained 39 judg ments against polluters; has pending pollution suits against the Army, Port of New York Authority and automobile man ufacturers, and has recovered $10‐million in a decade for vic timized consumers. Criminal jurisdiction, Mr. Lefkowitz says, is given to dis trict attorneys by the state con stitution. Mr. Walinskv has decried lack of criminal prosecution in 58 cases of deaths of factory and construction workers in 1968, to which a state Labor. Department memorandum said health and safety law violations contributed. Mr. Lefkowitz says he never got such a report. To his in quiry, Industrial Commissioner Martin P. Catherwood has re plied the memorandum was “a subjective conclusion by non legal staff … useful in plan ning our inspection program … not sufficient to sustain criminal prosecution.” Lefkowitz Cites Gains Attorney General Lefkowitz cites two 1970 legislative ac tions as, in effect, recognizing his office is chiefly for civil law: ¶A new law established statewide task force to prose cute organized crime, with deputy attorney general jointly appointed by the Governor and Attorney General. Mr. Walin sky says the Attorney General could already prosecute income tax violations and move to dis solve “Mafia business corpora tions.” ¶A constitutional amendment, still needing passage by the next Legislature and voters, would set up a Department of Criminal Justice “to assist, co ordinate and supervise” dis trict attorneys and the police. Mr. Walinskv says this would not be needed if present At torney General powers were used. In the Controllership contest, Mr. Levitt has already been described by Governor Rocke feller as a sure victor. The Governor was understood even to have been ready to give Mr. Levitt a Republican nomination to minimize his voter attrac tion. Mr. Levitt says he has not been campaigning because he has been busy with negotiations for needed state borrowing. His campaign literature proclaims “savings from his management oriented ‘post‐audit’ program now amount to $295,567, 121.12.” Mr. Regan contends the Con troller's office should audit lo cal government books on more helpful two‐year interval, instead of every three to five years. He proposes to aid local ities in inter‐governmental co operation. He says he would re fuse approval of any state con tracts leading to pollution, in voking a power to bar “serious injury to the state.” The Conservative and Social ist Workers parties are biddine for all three offices, the Social ist Labor party for Lieutenant Governor and Controller, and the Communist party for Lieu tenant Governor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I., Oct. 22— Representative Allard K. Low enstein stood in the center of a living room here recently, seeking votes'from a small part of “the silent majority.” Low‐keyed and soft‐spoken, he talked about “a strange kind of double vision” in which, he said, more money was spent on farm subsidies, the war in Viet nam and the supersonic transport than on hot lunches for poor schoolchildren, the war on poverty and mass transit. Yet there was only mild criticism of President Nixon, and threaded through Mr. Low enstein's talk was a note of optimism. “We've solved much worse problems than we have now,” he told the 30 suburban, middle‐class men and women. There were few traces of the intense political activist who in 1967, long before opposition to the war in Vietnam was politically fashionable, spent months on the road helping to build an antiwar movement that culminated in the Presi dential candidacy of Senator Eugene J. McCarthy of Wiscon sin. Now Mr. Lowenstein, one of the most liberal men in Con gress and battling for Ns po litical life in a generally con servative district, describes himself as “a man of the main stream” and a politician who has “a great deal in common with genuine conservative in the areas of big government and on the question of vio lence.” Seeking a second term, the 41‐year‐old Representative is opposed by a 39‐year‐old Re publidan, State Senator Nor man F. Lent, and a politically unknown third candidate, Vin cent J. Carey, 49, who is run ning under the banner of the Right to Life party. That party was formed as a rallying point for foes, mostly Catholic, of the state's new abortion law. Mr. Lowenstein also has Liberal party endorsement. Mr. Lent is backed by the Conservative party. There are about 104,000 registered Republicans and 81,000 enrolled Democrats in the district, but Mr. Lowenstein narrowly won his first term against similar odds in 1968. The Republican‐controlled Leg islature redrew the district lines earlier this year to chop out the solidly Democratic and liberal Jewish Five Towns area from Mr. Lowenstein's district and replace it with the nomin ally Democratic but generally conservative Catholic area of Massapequa. Surgery May Not Work However, despite that legis lative surgery, top Democratic and Republican politicians familiar with the district agree that Mr. Lowenstein is prob ably leading Mr. Lent because he is better known and because of indications that strong at tacks by the Republican on the incumbent have backfired. Several politicians said that a major threat to Mr. Lowen stein's re‐election is James L. Buckley, the Conservative par ty candidate who both sides say will capture not only the district but also the county. Mr. Lent is teamed up with Mr. Buckley on the Conservative line on the ballot and with Sen ator Charles E. Goodell on the Republican line. The Buckley Link Mr. Lent has declined to endorse either, but has made it plain where his preference lies by appearing with Mr. Buckley and declaring that his wife is supporting the Conservative contender. A Lowenstein Congressional newsletter last summer in cluded a picture of Mr. Lowen stein with William F. Buckley, the writer and editor who is the younger brother of the Sen ate candidate. Mr. Buckley had appeared at one of a series of district forums sponsored by Mr. Lowenstein. Mr. Lowenstein is not adverse to being linked with James Buckley. He noted in an interview this week that he had seen a half dozen cars with Buckley and Lowenstein bump er stickers. The new Lowenstein image is designed to meet the realities of a right‐to‐middle‐road con stituency and to blunt the ma jor thrust of Mr. Lent's cam paign—that the Representative is an ultraliberal who does not represent/the views of his con stituents. Mr. Lent, who had been known as a moderate, pro Rockefeller Republican, has backed up his campaign theme with slashing attacks on Mr. Lowenstein, including charges that he wanted Amerman youth “to use their bodies for con frontation.” He also notes that Mr. Lowenstein appeared at an anti war rally in Washington last year at which “the Vietcong flag was prominently displayed while the United States flag was desecrated” and that Mr. Lowenstein favors the busing of school children to promote integration — an explosive issue in a district that has sizable Negro enclaves in Roosevelt, Freeport and Long Beach. Mr. Lent, in the first of a series of 18 debates with Mr. Lowenstein and Mr. Carey, also charged that the Representa tive “echoes the line of Hanoi,” was the “chief apologist of the. Black Panthers” and “crawled out from under a rock” to vote against a military appropria tions act. Warned of Backfire Mr. Lent, confronted with barrage of criticism by local newspapers and warned by fel low Republicans that such tac tics might backfire, has ap parently toned down his oral attacks on his opponent. He said in an interview this week that he had been “nervous” at the first confrontation and had become, more heated than he intended. Mr. Lent's printed material, however, is still sharply critical of the incumbent. One handbill shows a picture of marching Soviet troops and asks: “What keeps them in Red Square, Mos cow not Times Square, New York?” The punchline is that Representative Lowenstein voted 18 times against de fense appropriation measures and adds that if those views prevailed, the United States would be without an Army, Navy and Air Force. The heat of the literature was not carried over to two debates this week in Rockville Centre and Long Beach. Never theless, Mr. Lent, a polished speaker and natty dresser, cata logued Lowenstein votes again military defense appropriations bills, an antipornography bill, a measure to cut off Federal aid to students involved in campus disorders and the Dis trict of Columbia anticrime bill. He asserted that. Mr Lowenstein “uses his office tc project his own ultralibera views on the national scene.” Mr. Lowenstein responded by declaring that several of the bills he opposed were ineffec tive or unconstitutional, includ ing the antipornography and the anticrime measures. He said that the vote Mr. Lent interpreted as favoring busing to promote integration was actually against a measure that was also opposed by two Long Island Republican mem bers of Congress and the Nixon Administration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Heated Campaign Fought in Washington State Over Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/25/archives/heated-campaign-fought-in-washington-state-over-abortions.html,"OLYMPIA, Wash., Oct. 24— “Kill Referendum 20, not me,” says a billboard in the state of Washington. “Let him live. Vote No on Referendum 20.” says another sign. The billboards picture a four‐ month‐old fetus in the palm of a man's hand. The advertise ments are paid for by the Voice for ‘the Unborn, a group that has mounted a strong campaign against a referendum measure that will be decided by Wash ington voters on Nov. 3. The measure, with some ex ceptions, would allow women to have legal abortions, in con trast with the present statute, which prohibits all abortions except when the life of the mother or child is at stake. Many state legislatures have grappled with proposals for abortion reform, but Washing ton is the only state planning to place the matter before the voters. Consequently, the argu ments and pressures of its ad vocates and critics are being directed at voters rather than at legislators. A drive to change the state's abortion statute died in a State Senate committee last fall, but it was revived in a special leg islative session in January. The Legislature voted to put the matter on the ballot as a ref erendum measure. What Measure Provides Referendum 20 allows an abortion to be performed if a woman wants it, provided that her husband, if he is living with her, gives his consent. If she is unmarried and under 18, her guardian must give consent. In addition, the pregnancy must be of less than 16 weeks, the woman must have been a resident of the state for 90 days and the operation must be performed in an accredited hospital or other medical facil ity approved by the State Board of Health. No employe of a hospital may be required to assist in the operation if he objects. All over the state, the refer endum measure is being de bated before parent‐teacher as sociations, student groups and other organizations. Panelists are provided by Washington Citizens for Abortion Reform and the Voice for the Unborn. Supporters of the proposition criticize the opponents’ bill boards. “The billboards are an ex cellent example of scare tactics in addition to being tasteless,” Helen Bonds, a social worker who is executive director of the group sponsoring the meas ure, said recently. “The decision to bear a child is a basic human right. The state should not make the de cision for the woman or the family as to Whether she is to bear a child. “Under Referendum 20, no one is compelled to have an abortion. The woman is merely given the right to have one, with the benefit of expert con sultation and the best medical care available. But the referen dum is being distorted by the campaign against it. The con cept of freedom of choice goes right over their heads.” Kenneth D. Vanderhoef, a lawyer, who is chairman of the Voice for the Unborn, defended the billboards with this com ment: “They show an exact medical school replica of a four‐month baby. If the billboard seems to be shocking, perhaps it is the idea of abortion that is shock ing.” Mr. Vanderhoef said that Ro man Catholic Churches in the state were active in opposing the proposition but added: “Certainly, the church's po sition is clear. But the move ment is much broader based. Only 13 per cent of the state's population is Catholic. Catho lice are a minority on our exec utive board. The bead of the Churches Division of our group is a Lutheran minister, Arthur Schweim of Seattle. “It is a tremendous affront to non‐Catholics to say that Catholics are the only ones sen sitive to the abortion issue. This is a human issue, not a religious one. “Sponsors of the resolution acknowledge in their literature that it is not pleasant to think of aborting a life. But apparent ly they feel that for socio‐eco nomic reasons, life is expend able. We, on the other hand, recognize the socio‐economic problems and must be sensitive to them—but taking life is no solution.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Medicine/Science,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/25/archives/medicinescience-its-still-difficult-to-get-an-abortion-in-new-york.html,"When the New York State leg islators passed the nation's most liberal abortion law last April, they held out the promise that after July 1, any woman would have the right to obtain a legal abortion from a qualified physi cian up to the 24th week of pregnancy. But a three‐week investiga tion by this reporter of the state's abortion situation revealed that many women—particularly the ill‐informed and unaggressive —are finding this an empty promise. Faced with long waiting lists, high costs, complicated pro cedures and poor communication, an unknown number of women have been turned away still preg nant with children they do not went. Even for the many thousands of women who have managed to obtain a safe, legal abortion in the last three and a half months, the experience was frequently marred by upsetting delays, caus tic remarks, administrative er rors, confusion, loneliness and fear. New Strains Last week, new regulations took effect in New York City that are expected, at least tem porarily, to make it even more difficult for women to obtain le gal abortions here. The regula tions, enacted into the city Health Code by the Board of Health, prohibit the performance of abor tions in doctors’ offices’ and clin ics lacking extensive—and ex pensive—emergency equipment. The regulations are expected to place an added strain on a hos pital system that is already groaning under the abortion load. Although no one knows how many abortions have been per formed in doctors’ offices here since July 1, some experts esti mate that there may have been as many as one office abortion for every hospital abortion—or more than 25,000. Especially hard‐hit by the new regulations will be women from outside New York, since many— if not most—of the office abor tions are believed to have been performed on nonresidents and many hospitals may now be forced to limit themselves to resi dents in order to handle the de mand. The new restrictions may also add to the difficulties that wo men in the low to middle income groups already face in obtaining abortions they can afford. A pa tient who is not eligible for Medi caid usually has to pay the full hospital charges in advance which range from $110 for simple, early abortion in a muni cipal hospital to as much as $700 for late‐in‐pregnancy procedures in some private hospitals. Fees Are High The Investigation by this re porter revealed that, despite good intentions on the part of many, nearly everyone involved with abortions has contributed in some way to the problems that sur round them. Hospitals, with their built‐in costs (high overhead, de livery room fees etc.) procedural delays, clerical mismanagement Lnd long waiting lists frighten away many women and delay others until an inexpensive, rela tively safe abortion—or any abortion at all—is impossible to obtain. Many doctors who in the past have condemned the extortionist” prices of criminal abortion ists, are themselves charging the same high prices for legal abor tions. Some nurses anc. other medical personnel who disap prove of abortions subject their patients to sneers, insults and sermons that add to the patients’ already heavy emotional burden. On the other hand, abortion pa tients have placed a psycholog ical burden on many nurses, who spend the better part of their working day caring for new mo thers and their wanted babies. Women's groups that make strident demands for free abor tions for every woman who wants one, and commercial referral ser vices that solicit “business” from all over the country, ‘antagonize many members of the medical es tablishment and foster among them an attitude of nonpartici pation. And patients themselves, many of whom make appoint ments at several different hospi tals as “insurance,” compound the problem of delays by failing to cancel those they don't intend to keep. Clinics Proposed Many doctors and administra tors believe that the only sensible solution to these problems is to take the simple, early abortions out of the hospitals altogether and reserve these facilities for the late‐in‐pregnancy procedures and those complicated by under lying illnesses. Alfred Moran, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood of New York City, suggests that eight to 10 nonprofit outpatient abortion clinics capable of doing 80,000 to 100,000 abortions a year should be set up. The cost of such a clinic network would be $3‐ million to $4‐million. Planned Parenthood itself is considering establishing such a clinic, but even if the organization decides to do so, it would be at least three months before the clinic is in operation. There are only two clinics in existence that may be able to satisfy the new city regulations —the Women's Medical Center (formerly the Dr. Michael Berg man Clinic) at 80 Irving Place, and the Women's Medical Group, run by Dr. Hale Harvey at 133 East 73rd St. Together, the clin ics—both nonprofit—could do perhaps 50,000 abortions a year at a cost ranging from nothing to $200 a procedure. Clinics like these two are geared toward easing the tension and removing the fears that have traditionally surrounded abor tions. At Dr. Harvey's clinic, for example, a counselor accompan ies each patient through the en tire procedure, discussing her fears and problems, answering her questions, holding her hand. In contrast, the attitude of many hospital personnel was summarized by one hospital ad ministrator, who told this re reporter, “Don't make it too easy for the patient. If it's too easy, she'll be back here in three months for another abortion.” —JANE E. BRODY Peace Prize Goes to Leader of The ‘Green Revolution’ The Nobel Peace Prize for 1970 was awarded last week to a 56‐year‐old agronomist from Iowa who knows more about the seeds of wheat than the seeds of war. Dr. Norman E. Borlaug was awarded his prize, valued at $78,000, for leadership of the Green Revolution—the develop ment through “genetic engineer ing” of new cereal varieties whose introduction into develop ing countries has enormously in creased crop yields and helped exorcise threats of famine. Now visible across a great sweep of farm horizons, the rev olution began obscurely in 1944 when the Rockefeller Founda tion sent Dr. Borlaug to Mexico to develop new wheat strains which would enable Mexico to become independent of wheat imports. There are thousands of wheat strains (all plants of a strain are genetically identical), and each has advantages and dis advantages in size, disease re sistance, growing period and the like. The point of creating new strains is to eliminate undesir able qualities and combine de sirable ones. Dr. Borlaug's basic materials were Japanese Norin dwarf wheat—which has short, stiff straw and uses fertilizer efficiently in producing grain rather than excess straw—anti Gaines winter wheat and its rel atives which have produced up to 216 bushels an acre in the Pacific northwest. How It's Done Wheat is self‐pollinated—its sex organs combine male and female elements within one struc ture and Dr. Borlaug developed new strains by delicate cross pollination. He opened one floret (sex organ) after another—the individual wheat head usually has over 50 florets—and with tweezer removed the anther (male element). When he had collected perhaps a hundred of these tiny, yellow, pollen‐bearing elements, he inserted each into an emasculated floret of another wheat strain. From this forcible coupling of two strains, a child of new genet ic makeup was born. Seeds from this new strain were then planted, and the planting pro cess was repeated unto the sixth generation of the strain. This sixth, genetically pure for desired characteristics, was then accepted—or rejected as having failed to live up to Dr. Bor laug's hopes. To speed the development process, Dr. Borlaug worked winters at plots in Mexico's subtropical Sonora state, and summers in the cooler 10,000‐ foot‐high valley of Toluca. Tak ing materials from one to the other, he got two generations of experimental strains each year. Ten years after his arrival, Mexico stopped importing wheat; ten years after that, yields aver aged 39 bushels an acre of wheat (instead of 11) with good milling and baking qualities and higher proteins. In 1966 Dr. Borlaug be gan helping India's farmers, and his 8,156th strain (the Indians called it Kalyan Sona, or Golden Saviour) took hold marvelously and allowed double and triple cropping each year. But if all wheat were of one strain, disease could be catas trophic. So India and Pakistan planted other Borlaug strains as well. And scientists stressed the “complete package” — which meant controlled irrigation, sophisticated use of pesticides and insecticides, optimal fertil ization, mechanization, and im provements in marketing, stor age and credit facilities. Some Problems The revolution has not yet produced utopia: It is upsetting traditional tenant‐landlord rela tionships and threatens to in crease unemployment in coun tries where unemployment is al ready massive. But it is produc ing greatly increased food sup plies—and the Revolution has ex tended to rice, corn, sorghums and millets. It also threateni to dull the edge of arguments in favor of birth control. But Dr. Borlaug warns that his revolu tion will afford only a reprieve, not a permanent solution, to the population problem. He is now director of the wheat program at the Interna tional Maize and Wheat Im provement Center, an independ ent organization supported by the Rockefeller and Ford Foun dations and the Agency for In ternational Development, with help also from the UN Develop ment Program and the Inter American Development Bank. Dr. Borlaug still spends most of each day in the fields with young scientists (the “Borlaug apostles”), rising early, quitting late, working on new wheat strains and on triticale—a man made species which results from a cross of wheat and rye. He also travels widely to work in foreign fields. Dr. Borlaug is that rarest of revolutionaries who finds a welcome at every border. ‐ISRAEL SHENKER",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/25/archives/law-both-sides-try-to-put-panther-party-on-the-stand.html,"Trouble for a judge is the judge giving an order and some one disobeying it. Last week, in a crowded courtroom on the 13th floor of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, John M. Murtagh had trouble. “The Black Panther party is not on trial,” Justice Murtagh warned as he started off the trial of 13 Panthers accused of con spiring to bomb and kill; as result, he intoned, “any proof with respect to the Black Panther party is irrelevant unless it re lates directly to the defendants.” But what followed, like a slap on the face from the two sets of lawyers who sat before him, was talk to the jury about the Panther party. And almost none of it was “directly” related to the 11 men and two women on trial. First came the prosecutor. The Panthers, he said, were a “bunch of fanatics.” Panthers wore uni forms and held Army‐style titles they collected weaponry; they tried to wreck the establishment by waging guerrilla war with the police. Next, the defense staff. The Panthers, said the defense, were young and idealistic. Panthers had weapons for self‐defense only; they abhorred violence; they used bad words not to warn of bad deeds to come but, in stead to shock the conscience of people who would rather not be shocked. Not a Defendant So it went, with each side get ting out a phrase or a sentence or even a few minutes of talk before the judge interrupted to say he didn't want to hear any more about the Panther party. So it might continue—except for the fact that as the week pro ceeded, through the District At torney's opening statement on Monday and the defense's state ment on Tuesday, and then two days of prosecution witnesses, Justice Murtagh insisted more and more frequently that the Panther party was not, tech nically, a defendant in the case. So the questions, by week's end, were these: How long could either the prosecutor or the de fense continue to rebuff the judge and talk about the party? And why, indeed, were they talk ing about the party at all? To look at the “why” ques tion first. Joseph Phillips, the as sistant district attorney who is prosecuting the case, to be sure, has insisted all along that this is just a criminal trial, rather than, as the defendants contend, a political trial. But to prove the criminal charges, he must prove that the defendants in tended to commit the crimes charged; to show the intent, he says, he has to present what he considers the Panther party's revolutionary, police‐killing dog ma to which the 13 defendants allegedly subscribe. (The District Attorney's office also hopes to disillusion the white liberals and radicals who have taken up the Panther's ban ner; they insist, however, that this is a by‐product of rather than a reason for their descrip tion of the party.) The defendants have more rea sons for wanting to give their own picture of their party. First, as they have said from the be ginning, they consider the trial a political prosecution brought because the government wishes to suppress their political activ ity; if they can show that their party was nonviolent instead of criminal, they think, they can show that the government has no valid reason to prosecute them. Second, they want to use the trial to publicize their party in order to gain more black sup porters; thus, they want to show that the party—of which they were the major New York City members—was trying to end rac ism and discrimination by legal and peaceful means. Finally, they want to disprove Mr. Phillips's contention that they intended to commit violent criminal acts; showing that they were governed by party rules, and that party rules forbid ag gressive violence, would obvious ly help their case. Still, Justice Murtagh is pre siding over the trial. He says that evidence must be limited to the specific acts charged; both Monday and Tuesday he repeat edly cut off the lawyers when ever they ventured into general descriptions or allegations about the party. So, how much further can either side go? The different way he cut off the two sides may hint the answer. The judge, for instance, even tually did tell the jurors to dis regard Mr. Phillips's statement about “fanatics.” But he did not disallow the prosecutor's de scription of the party as “para military,” or his remarks that the party “propaganda” machine stressed that the police were the key to the white power structure and thus should be crushed, or his statement that the party re quired members to see the “Bat tle of Algiers,” a film that docu ments the course and tactics of a revolution. Justice Murtagh did, however, cut off the two Panthers defend ing themselves as soon as they started to give some history of the party; he did say in his own opening remarks that even if the jury thought the defendants’ mo tives were commendable, they were not to consider motive in determining guilt or innocence. So what will happen now is unclear, with only a few points relatively certain—Justice Mur tagh said that he would not al low Mr. Phillips to prove that the Panther party was set up solely to wage war with police, and that he would not allow any defense evidence of Panther breakfast programs either. Yet if the prosecution is al lowed to introduce supposed party dogma as a means of prov ing the defendants’ alleged criminal intent—something that the judge indicated would be allowed—how are the defendants to rebut this? To many lawyers, the only satisfactory rebuttal would be the defendants giving their version of party dogma—a dogma that includes, along with the revolutionary rhetoric, such things as breakfast programs. One lawyer summed it up by saying the party is “either in the trial or out of it, and if one side gets its innings, so should the other.” For the mo ment at least—despite Justice Murtagh—the party would seem to be in it. —LESLEY OELSNER WASHINGTON — It has be come increasingly evident in re cent weeks that the Supreme Court must soon resolve a grow ing conflict between its own doctrines of personal privacy and officialdom's power to reg ulate the enjoyment of sex. Until the past five years, there had never been much le gal doubt about the states's au thority to protect the public mor als and welfare through laws against such evils as abortion, pornography, birth control and unmarried sex. There had also been little doubt of the Federal Government's power to purify the mails and ports of entry. Then in 1965 the Supreme Court handed down a 5 to 4 decision, Griswold v. Connecticut, which struck down a law that out lowed the use of contraceptives, even by married couples. The Court declared that this violat ed individuals’ “right of priva cy” in sexual matters. Last year the Court, in Stan ley v. Georgia, threw out the conviction of an Atlanta man who had been found guilty of possessing obscene matter after a gambling raid turned up a movie projector and some de cidedly obscene “skinflicks” in his apartment. The judges agreed that even though the First Amendment does not shield obscenity from Government reg ulation, the Constitution does protect individuals’ rights in the privacy of their homes to in dulge in any thoughts — includ ing lecherous ones. What the justices were say ing was that some areas of per sonal intimacy and thought are off limits to government control. People had professed to believe that for years, but once the Court expressed it in constitu tional terms, a number of prickly questions surfaced concerning the Constitution and sex. Now the Supreme Court has more cases on its docket concerning various aspects of sex than at any time in its history. Within the next few weeks the Supreme Court will hear ar guments from indignant Boston officials who were thwarted by a Federal judge when they tried to ban the erotic Swedish film, “I Am Curious (Yellow).” The judge felt that If the affluent Mr. Stanley had a right to sa vor his skinflicks at home, the adult citizen with only $2.50 in his pocket had a right to see “Curious” in a discreetly adver tised public showing. Several days ago the Supreme Court also granted the Justice Department's equally indignant appeals of two lower court de cisions that declared unconstitu tional the Federal laws that ban the importation and mailing of smut. The lower court judges reasoned that if one has a con stitutional right to appreciate dirty pictures at home, the right to obtain the pictures must also be protected by the Constitution. Last Tuesday, the United States Court of Appeals in New York followed through with predictable ruling: The Constitu tion protects the right of con senting adults to send obscene matter to one another through the mails for noncommercial purposes. Meanwhile, Griswold v. Con necticut's suggestion that the Government cannot reach the physical intimacies of sex has produced a string of rulings in validating the anti‐abortion laws of the District of Columbia, Georgia, Texas, Wisconsin and California. Most of these deci sions have already been appealed to the Supreme Court. Nobody knows how far the current trend will go, but a pair of appeals from Texas hints that there is much in store for the Supreme Court yet. ‘Danish’ Solution It seems apparent that unless the Supreme Court changes the lower courts’ marching orders, the United States could eventual ly arrive at the “Danish” solu tion toward sex — a hands‐off policy by the Government to ward adults’ sexual conduct. Despite the politicians’ indig nation over the National Com mission on Obscenity and Por nography's recommendation that the law should not attempt to interfere with adults’ freedom to obtain explicit sexual materials, anyone who has been to Times Square recently knows that the law is very nearly that already. Because of rulings by the Su preme Court and lower courts that make it all but impossible to make an obscenity conviction stick unless minors and pander ing of public vujgarity are in volved, officials of many urban areas are already observing the pornography commission's ad vice. This attitude obviously dis comforts some politicians, in cluding President Nixon, who would like td see things other wise. Yesterday in Maryland, the President bitterly attacked the commission for turning in a re port that contained, he said, “morally bankrupt conclusions and major recommendations.” In his Administration, he added, “there will be no relaxation in the national effort to control and eliminate smut from our national life.” In fact, the President con cluded, “smut should not be simply contained at its present level; it should be outlawed in every state of the union.” Lurking in the background of many of the recent rulings is the specter of George Orwell's nov el, “1984,” where Big Brother monitored the public's attitudes toward sex as the cornerstone of his thought‐control program. As Justice Thurgood Marshall put it for the Court in Stanley v. Georgia, “Our whole constitu tional heritage rebels at the thought of giving government the power to control men's minds.” Some of the lower court rul ings now coming before the jus tices may be reversed. President Nixon has, as a matter of policy, avoided appointing swingers to the Supreme Court, and it may well find that the lower courts have occasionally carried a good principle too far. But the trend toward greater constitutional protection of private thought and conduct seems well estab lished now, and is likely to con tinue. When the court‐martial of Sgt. David Mitchell opened two weeks ago at Fort Hood, Tex., there were some who thought that at last many of the questions on the alleged massacre of perhaps more than 500 Vietnamese civilians by American troops at Sonmy vil lage on March 16, 1968, might be cleared away. Testimony, it was predicted, might point to whom had given the orders that led to the action, how high in the chain of command the responsibility went, how and why no word of the massacre had been made pub lice for nearly 18 months. But at the weekend, the ques tions all remained and there was reason to doubt that the court martial of Sergeant Mitchell— charged with assault with intent to commit murder on about 30 Vietnamese civilians—would do much toward solving them. After putting only three witnesses, all soldiers in the attacking com pany that day, on the stand to testify that they saw Sergeant Mitchell shooting into a ditch where the civilians had been herded, the Army abruptly rested its case last Tuesday. It had taken less than 10 hours to pre sent its evidence. Then on Thursday, with the court‐martial in recess as the defense — caught short by the Army's move—sought to organ ize its case, Sergeant Mitchell's civilian attorney, Ossie B. Brown, was rushed to the hospital suf fering from physical exhaustion. On Friday it was announced that he would not be released until sometime this week and would need “some time to get his strength back.” As a result, the court‐martial of Sergeant Mit chell has been postponed inde finitely. Thus the first real answers to the questions about Sonmy may now come in the impending court‐martial of Sergeant Mit chell's platoon leader, Lieut. William L. Calley Jr., scheduled to begin Nov. 18.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/25/archives/letters-to-the-editor.html,"To the Editor: Arthur Goldberg's response of firing two of his campaign aides who were heckling Governor Rockefeller during a campaign appearance on the Lower East Side deserves a bit more reflec tion than it was apparently given. It is unfortunate and indeed repre hensible that eggs were thrown'during the appearance. But this should not be allowed to obscure the question of whether or not heckling is a healthy and legitimate part of democratic politics. In his formal apology to the Governor, Mr. Goldberg said that such action was disgrace, intolerable, not permissible.” The argument that the Governor was entitled to the courtesy of being listened to by virtue of his office, as Mr. Rockefeller insisted, or as any candidate should be, as Mr. Goldberg insisted, shows that the tradition of heckling remains still somewhat am biguous. It is, however, disturbing that the technique of heckling is in danger of falling into disrepute in American politics. We have as evidence not only the public response to President Nix on's confrontation with some hecklers in Kansas last month, but now the disfavor even in what was obviously a campaign appearance by the Gov ernor. It shows most of all the docil ity and passivity of the American elec torate in their willingness to tolerate such political nonsense as is common place nowadays. That people should so willingly sub mit to the cliches and trite evocation that are taken as campaign speeches is hardly promising for the future of our democratic system. That it should be formally discouraged by our lead ers reveals the distance between them and the voters in contemporary poli tics. Once again maintenance of order and propriety is asserted over at tempts to deal squarely with issues and ability. Once again the blandness of the “old politics” provides the il lusion of security in times that cry out for honesty. We ought rather to have more heckling in American politics. It is an art which needs cultivation and prac tice so that it achieves effects which egg‐throwing can never reach. Our political leaders ought to be told that their toastmasters’ personalities and their bland arguments cannot alone speed them into office. They need to be forced to demon strate the agility of mind and sharp ness of wit that are the hallmark of healthy democratic leadership. As they hide increasingly behind the canned images of the TV screens, where confrontation is impossible, how else can the people really know their leaders? Experiment in Chile To the Editor: The Times has expressed some anxiety concerning the outcome of recent elections in Chile. I believe there is also cause for hope. Chile may become the first nation in the world to sustain a program of Marxist aspiration while maintaining those liberties we cherish in our Bill of Rights. If Chile maintains its free doms, perhaps it will in the long run maintain the allegiance of those diverse segments so vital for increased pro ductivity in all fields. The radical alteration of property relationships in Marxist experiments has always created a severe shock, but if it is unaccompanied by the loss of freedom, new horizons may be in store for Chile. Freedom of speech may become even more meaningful and effective for the poor. Freedom of criticism may adjust some of the errors commonly committed by Marxist dictatorships in the past and present. While I have no great optimism that Chile is suddenly going to turn into a utopia, I do believe it is undergoing a noble struggle. We should hope for its success because it could teach so much to the Communists, the West and the Third World. To Study Energy Sources To the Editor: I was very pleased to see J. K. Mustard's Oct. 18 letter on energy sources, though it appears at first sight to be a severe criticism of my own let ter of Oct. 11. I was not advocating nuclear power. My plea was for the use of all available relevant quantita tive information in making environ mental decisions. If all those who consider them selves to be concerned about the en vironment could be won over so quick ly to this point of view, half the battle for a cleaner and safer environment (and by no means the easier half) would be won. How is it that he and I appear to disagree so strongly on the probable health hazard of nuclear power plants (32,000 or more deaths a year by his estimate, fewer than ten by mine)? We may not differ at all, because we cal culated different quantities. Mr. Mustard (quoting Gofman and Tamplin) estimated the damage caused if everyone received the “max imum permissible dose” of radiation. I estimated the damage if all present electric power were produced by nu clear plants. Both estimates may be wrong, but it is perfectly possible that they are both correct. My estimates were offered merely as examples of calculations which should be made. I did not mention, for instance, either pollution from nuclear fuel reprocessing (perhaps more seri ous than emissions from power plants themselves), nor the probable contri butions of coal plants to emphysema and chronic bronchitis. I emphatically agree that there is an urgent need for research on fusion power and for clean ing up coal‐operated plants, to men tion but two examples. Let us treat energy and the environ ment as subjects for the most careful possible study. All of us should avoid thinking of this as a “debate” between those already committed to particular courses of action. Assessing Obscenity Report To the Editor: I hope that Prof. Reo M. Christenson brings more judicious objectivity to his assessments in the field of political science than he does to the Report on the Commission on Obscenity and Pornography. [Letter Oct. 18.] He implies that a scientist who sup ports the report is not responsible. This is the same type of thinking put forth by the White House. If a com mission report does not agree with the thinking of the powers that be, the commission must be irresponsible. An analogy to Professor Christen son's non sequitur in the first para graph is the following: The statement that there is no evidence that eating yogurt causes cancer may be true. However, a more accurate statement would be: “The causes of cancer are not known.” Any number of respon sible scientists would support this statement. He also implies that the majority of the commission presented their report as if they were a group of scientists citing objective quantitative data. The commission does not make any such pretense. He also gets into a rambling dead‐end argument about what is scientific and what is not, what can be proven and what cannot, in the area of obscenity and pornography. The majority of the commission pre sented its conclusions on the basis of the evidence that was revealed during their investigations. I presume that if these conclusions had supported the writer's thinking he would have judged them accurate and scientific. Professor Christenson also makes the observation that the majority of Americans would agree with him that the stage and screen should not be turned into one big stag show. The commission did not recommend or sug gest anything of the sort, and I think the professor is letting his imagination run wild. He concludes by blaming everything on the intellectuals; apparently Pro fessor Christenson does not consider himself a member of this group. I am sure he would agree that the School Board in Merrick, L. I., that exfoliated certain pages of a book because sex was discussed in them was scientific, accurate, responsible and defending the American way of life. [Editorial Oct. 23.] No Reform in Welfare Bill To the Editor: Your Oct. 11 editorial called the actions of the Senate Finance Com mittee in defeating President Nixon's Family Assistance Plan the “sabo taging of welfare reform.” A closer examination would show that partici pating in the defeat of this plan were some of the most outspoken advocates of welfare reform. The reason: the plan is not reform of welfare, but federalization of it. Although the plan has been de scribed as a work‐incentive program which extends aid to the working poor, the figures presented to the committee by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare showed that the plan contained disincentives amounting to 90 per cent or more of earnings. This is the same as exists in the present welfare mess. I was among those who were asked to testify at the Finance Committee hearings because of my campaign to replace welfare with a full incentive income allowance. I commend the diligence of the committee in exploring the deficiencies of the President's plan. LEONARD M. GREENE White Plains, N. Y., Oct. 13, 1970 Population Myth Doubted To the Editor: In his Op. Ed. column opposed to birth control (Oct. 14) L. Brent Bozell states: “The myth of too many people is now being abandoned even by those active in population‐control circles.” However, it seems to be generally ac cepted that more rather than fewer persons now are worried about over population. In order to dispel one's natural doubts about the accuracy of his ob servation, Mr. Bozell should have named those engaged in population control who no longer are concerned about “too many people.” Prospects for a Cease‐Fire in Vietnam To the Editor: The first serious critical appraisal of Mr. Nixon's cease‐fire proposal to ap pear in your columns is, in my opinion, the Oct. 10 column by Anthony Lewis. Your editorials of Oct. 8 and 9 seem to me devoted to quite a different purpose — to do your bit to persuade the enemy to respond favorably by trying to make the proposal appear less unfavorable to him than it is, and by warning him that, if he does not, the “onus for an unnecessary war” will rest with him. “It is not in Hanoi's interest,” you say, “to ignore the political fact that the Nixon plan has created a new con sensus.” You are, of course, part of this consensus. It was, I believe, the principal aim of the plan to create this consensus and to end the deep division in this country which Americans hate even more than the war. Anything remotely plausible — cease‐fire, ending the bloodshed—was at this stage a sure thing. In spite of the fact, to which Anthony Lewis draws attention, that the cease‐fire bit has no practical meaning, Mr. Nixon has brilliantly outsmarted his critics. But he has not outsmarted the enemy. To suppose that they will be come less intransigent on essential matters, if only the American op ponents of the war and the allies and clients of the United States abroad join the consensus, is a profound mistake. The distinction between pub lic relations and political realities is not one that the enemy find hard to draw. They are fighting to free their coun try of foreign occupation, as they have fought for the past 25 years. They are asked to share power with regime which could not last a day with out this foreign occupation. They are invited to look forward to another Indochina conference under the aegis of the Great Powers. They made the mistake of accepting a “provisional settlement” at such a conference in 1954. They are not likely to make the same mistake again. In your view, the response will show “whether the Communists real ly want to achieve a compromise.” They have never pretended to seek compromise of the kind you en visage. Their purpose in negotiating is to arrange a withdrawal of U.S. forces and a new regime in Saigon un supported by the United States. You regard this as unreasonable. But you are not fighting a war of national liberation. What the enemy considers unreasonable and unacceptable is the idea that America should assume the right to have any say at all in Viet namese affairs. To you the war is “unnecessary.” To the enemy, no war could be more necessary. Whose country is under for eign occupation? Whose country has been subjected by foreigners to an un precedented hail of modern fire‐power and chemicals? It is convenient for a country which is hopelessly in the wrong to point to the indiscriminate horrors of war, and to propose a “compromise” to end it. How appealing. You cannot see any point in con tinuing the war. But if you thought a just war, you could and would. And that is what it is to the enemy. Na tional liberation, which is just another slogan to you, is for the enemy the whole point of the war.

Random Impressions of a Changing Land,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/25/archives/random-impressions-of-a-changing-land.html,"BUCHAREST—The Athenee Palace Ho tel provides accommodations, food and services in the grand old European man ner: curved carpeted staircases, page boys in pillbox hats, gilt and glass, gypsy violins with dinner. At $12 a double room, it is a bargain in any body's language—and you are liable to hear them all in the busy lobby. An attractive girl with olive skin and long brown hair sits at the desk of the Rumanian National Tourist Office, mak ing arrangements for visitors. One of the attractions she recommends is four‐hour, $5 tour of the city in the comfort of a Mercedes‐Benz with a post graduate economics student as guide. Slim, bespectacled and dressed in a suit of coarse cloth but modish cut, the guide sits beside the driver and runs through familiar patter about the “Paris of the Balkans” like any other Bucharest tour‐conductor. But if you take up his suggestion of a mug of beer at an an cient dark‐paneled beer hall, he opens up with unexpected frankness and will answer any question put to him. His comments came back to me dur ing the ensuing two weeks as my wife and I wandered through Rumania in rented Fiat. When President Nixon came here last year. 100,000 people turned out to greet him. But this wasn't because they admired the American system or any thing like that; they just wanted to show their friendship for the American people. The Rumanians want to show their friendship for everyone except the Hun garians and the Russians, in that order. They are genuinely warm and hospit able. A clerk in the Athenoe Palace lent me 50 lei ($2.50) out of his pocket to pay the taxi fare from the airport— without even asking my name. It took me four days to find him again and pay him back. A girl selling bunches of narcissuses from table to table in a restaurant smiled at us even though I shook my head. She selected a single bloom and presented it to my wife anyway. A driver on a country road flagged us down and gave me a cardigan which an old lady had left in his car when he dropped her off five miles back. She would now be sitting by the road side back there. As I would be passing the spot, would I give it to her? After offering it to every old lady along the way, I found the right one. I might have been bringing her manna from heaven, so profuse were her thanks. Our major export is not oil, but oil drilling and refining equipment. Our oil is very high grade and mostly used for petrochemical products. Fortunately, the oil town of Ploesti is set back a couple of miles from the main road. Even so, the air pollution is bad enough to make one's eyes smart. A complex of great tubes and storage tanks rises from the plain, topped by a perpetual tongue of flame from tall chimney. Each large town has one gas station; the premium gas is 20 cents a gallon, but there are hardly any cars to use it. Outside Bucharest it's trucks only, huge, rusty, rattling monsters whose drivers show special consideration whenever they pass an ox‐cart, a bicycle or peasant woman with a sheaf of fire wood on her back. Rumanian workers pay about 5 per cent of their salary for their apartments. These have all been built in the last 10 years in satellite towns outside the cities. When Mr. Nixon saw these towns, he said he couldn't believe what had been achieved. Broad avenues on the outskirts of Bucharest, Brasov and Constanta are lined with rows of identical rectangular concrete‐block apartment houses five stories high. Between them are grassy areas, young trees, children's play areas and the occasional supermarket, restau rant or cinema. Some of these new towns accommodate 100,000 people. The men wear overalls or shabby suits, the women bulge out of calf‐length cotton dresses and cardigans. Everyone over 30 covers his head—blue berets or horn burgs for the men, scarves knotted under the chin for the women. The teen‐age girls like bright‐colored pants and simple blouses. The boys favor jeans and sportshirts. Their hair never comes below the collar. Nowhere in Rumania do you see hair on the face, except for some old peasant with a magnificent gray moustache. He will also probably be wearing wooden clogs held on with straps of leather, curled up high at the toe like a Turkish slipper. There is compulsory military service for all young men who are not taking higher education. But the army is mostly used for construction, which is better than for war. Gangs of soldiers carry cement in buckets to make yet another apartment building. The Transylvanian town of Miercurea Ciuj looks as if a bomb had hit the main street. Soldiers are laying a new sewer. Elsewhere I saw a convoy of camouflaged trucks full of soldiers with tommy guns. We are an island of Latin people in a sea of Slays. Our language is like Italian, and we are carefree and emo tional by nature. We work hard because we have to, for the good of the people, but we prefer to spend our efforts making our homes attractive. After school hours in the spring, boys and girls are digging flower beds in the school grounds. Women are planting along the roadside in the villages. The old men are painting or whitewashing their houses, conforming to the local traditional color scheme. In Transyl vania a pale blue wash Is predominant; in Moldavia each window has a broad green frame against brown wood. Up in the Carpathians an elaborate wooden porch as high as the house protects the gate into the front garden. In Bu charest the French‐style iron grilles on balconies and around properties gleam with new paint. No trash litters the streets or flower gardens, but there is little evidence of street cleaners; peo ple use the receptacles provided. There are no billboards; the only posters I saw were advertising enter tainment (plays, traveling circuses, con certs). Many of the shops have no names; the signs simply read “tailor,” “hardware” or “meat.” Except for sou venir handcrafts, the goods are poor quality. Advertising is virtually nonex istent. The TV programs are without commercials. Agriculture in Rumania is now 60 per cent mechanized. In America it is 98 per cent mechanized. But we are im proving. An ox lumbers along the road pulling a cart that looks like a flat‐bottomed boat on wheels. It is filled with manure from the farmer's cattleshed. He turns into his field, a newly plowed expanse that extends out of sight over the hill. The cart lurches across the furrows to a point about 20 feet from where the last pile of manure was dumped, the last of a hundred piles dotted across the field. The farmer's wife and two sisters methodically shovel out the dung, and the cart returns to the shed for another load. A small boy hitches a ride on the back. It gets to be lunchtime and the women eat their bread and salami, wash it down with some wine and then lie down on the black earth for a siesta, cloth‐wrapped legs protruding from un der their voluminous petticoats. An hour later they resume their toil. Rumania is increasing its industry at a great rate. Our future does not lie only in agriculture. Factories are decen tralized all over the country, wherever labor is available. The travel folders advertise Sinaia as a fashionable ski resort. The road winds up steeply alongside a rushing stream. A signboard points two kilome ters to the chairlift. Right ahead is cellulose factory, using water power from the stream and wood from the forest. A huge pall of yellow smoke belches out from the chimneys and wafts across the road toward the ski slopes. Two hundred miles north, near Bicaz, is a natural wonder of awesome pro portions. A river five yards wide cuts through a gorge a thousand feet high. Sunlight never penetrates, and the weeds grow yellow. One emerges from the gorge feeling small and humble. The road leads into a broader valley and then to Bicaz. But the town is hidden from view by a cloud of cement dust. The fields and trees and houses are white with it, layer upon layer blowing across from the industrial site that provides Bicaz with full employment. Mamaia is Rumania's biggest seaside resort, dominated by five enormous identical hotel blocks. Just north lies a manufacturing complex where the air is always thicker than fog. Barbed wire and armed guards on turrets indicate that this is a place where prisoners work out their time. There are more important problems than pollution in Rumania. The people were completely neglected under Rumania's three kings. King Carol's chief banker owned villa on a cliff above the Black Sea beaches at Eforie Nord. The main guest suite consists of a dining room, bed room and bathroom, all about the same size. A 20‐foot wall is fitted with hand turned closets and drawers. The bath is large enough to swim in. Carol used to bring his mistress, Madame Lupescu, to this villa. In 1947 the first President of the Ru manian People's Republic expropriated the villa for his own use, but later bowed to public opinion and gave it up. My wife and I rented the guest suite for $5 a night and there slept in the most comfortable king‐size bed in the country. Rumanxia has always been famous for its healing mineral waters. The natural hot springs were one of the reasons for its popularity with the ancient Romans. We have 20 spas which give three‐week courses of treatment to people with wide variety of disorders. In addition to mud and water therapy they receive injections of the rejuvenating substance H3, which was discovered by the great Professor Ana Asian. So much did this famous man do for Rumania that he is buried in the black marble mausoleum dedicated to the memory of our first President. After extensive laboratory analysis and testing in the United States, H3 has been declared of no value and its administration to patients fraudulent. There are 22‐million inhabitants of Rumania, but an economic survey has shown that we can support 50‐million. We must have that number if we are to be strong. You ask if I would be allowed to emigrate to some other coun try? I ask you why would I want to leave this beautiful land? Abortions are punishable by 10 years in jail. The sale and use of contracep tive devices carries a five‐year sentence. Nobody is allowed to leave the country permanently except elderly relatives of people already overseas. The British novelist, C. P. Snow, once said that Rumania was the tourist coun try of the future. We are at a restaurant on the out skirts of Bucharest called the Dos Cocosi (Two Cocks). It is a perfect country inn: enormous fireplace, cozy tables and booths with curtains for pri vacy, a family affair with waitresses in peasant costumes. The roast chicken (served with water‐ground corn‐meal mush) is so good that I try to ask in sign language whether the bird was cooked flambe style. At last the chef thinks he understands. He motions to us to wait and rushes to the kitchen, returning triumphantly in 10 minutes with the best crepes suzette I've ever eaten. With a bottle of dry red Tirnave wine, the bill comes to $7 for two. Later we go to the Melody Bar, plush nineteen‐forties night club, to watch an endless series of elaborately costumed dances representing the his tory of Rumania. At last it's over and the band breaks into a Cole Porter tune. We want to dance but nobody does. Dowdy companions sit in animated con versation, sipping the local apricot brandy while they wait for the next installment in the Rumanian saga. At the Melody Bar the customers do not participate, but they certainly enthuse. Latecomers stand five deep at the back, applauding every allegorical scene.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ronald Reagan Is Giving ‘Em Heck,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/25/archives/ronald-reagan-is-giving-em-heck-ronald-reagan-is-giving-em-heck.html,"LABOR DAY, 1970. Ronald Wilson Reagan, former sports announcer and movie star, former “bleeding heart” Democrat, now Governor of California, was going campaigning. The press had been waiting for sev eral minutes when he bounced onto the bus, waved out the window to a pair of white‐haired “young ladies,” handed his notes—neatly printed on white cards—to an aide and settled into a front seat. Then the bus pulled slowly away, headed for the Orange County Fairgrounds and the annual picnic of Local 324 of the Re tail Clerks International Association, A.F.L.‐C.I.O. It passed little stucco bungalows with aging Fords in the driveways, women in Bermuda shorts raking the grass and kids in T‐shirts riding bicycles, American flags flap ping in a soft breeze and freeways carpeting the sun‐charred landscape with wall‐to‐wall concrete. It passed something called “Movieland of the Air” and the General Steam Corpo ration, Dover Shores Veterinary Hos pital and the Happy Land Pre‐School. As it approached the fairgrounds one of the Governor's companions re marked that working people did not like to go to Labor Day picnics any more. Reagan flicked at the subject like a frog at a fly. “You youngsters probably don't remember,” he said to the middle‐aged labor leaders sitting around him, “but when I was young, golf was a sissy, rich man's game. So was boating and skiing and horse back riding. Today they're weekend sports for the working man; he doesn't have to go to Labor Day picnics.” The labor moguls nodded silently as the bus stopped and Reagan climbed down. He was dressed in a rather stiffly casual manner: black, pleated trousers hitched well above his im perceptible stomach, immaculate white suede shoes, a white sports shirt, open to reveal a well‐tanned chest slightly mottled with his 59 years. Deep lines fanned out from his eyes, giving the impression of a perpetual half‐squint. His jagged smile, revealing an uneven row of bottom teeth, glowed warmly. He was obviously fit, although slightly less bulky than usual, without the padded suit shoulders he favors. After greeting the leaders of the re tail clerks, Reagan stepped gingerly into the crowd, a sea of $2.95 plaid shirts, white‐rimmed sun glasses, flowered‐print dresses covering bos oms still clearly supported by Maid enform, drippy cones of crushed ice, Instamatic cameras and silver hair. “Hi, how are you?” the Governor repeated as he pushed slowly ahead, grabbing hands and signing his name. “Hi, how are you?” A man with a lot of c's and z's on his name tag asked about a proposed abortion law. “If they liberalize it all the way, you bet I won't sign it,” came the answer. Someone handed Reagan a flag, then a yellow teddy bear. The gifts were quickly passed back to his covey of youthful aides, most of whom looked like slightly weathered studen‐body presidents, all thinning hair and thick ening officiousness. (The teddy bear was treated like a time bomb; no one knew what to do with it. When the bus was leaving hours later the aides were still handing the grinning yellow toy to one another, trying to get rid of it.) As the crowd flowed around Reagan, it was obvious that they were not interested in seeing just another poli tician, or even another governor. They wanted to see a star. “I remember your pictures, Ron,” called one man. A mother nudged her daughter as she strained for a better look: “He used to be in the movies.” A woman with a huge Unruh button, advertising Reagan's opponent, pushed through for an autograph. Why? “For my kids,” she said sheepishly. “How come you never get old?” gushed an other admirer. “You just get better looking.” RONALD REAGAN is getting old, bat he still looks pretty good to a lot of Californians. As he enters his campaign for a second four‐year term in Sacramento, his vibrant self‐confi dence seems entirely justified. Any incumbent bears the scars of unful filled promise and unavoidable bore dom, and the White Knight of 1966 is beginning to rust in spots. But the polls continue to give him a consistent margin of about 10 points over Dem ocrat Jess Unruh, former Speaker of the State Legislature. Most experts would be surprised if he wins by less than a million votes, the margin by which he defeated former Governor Edmund G. Brown in his first try for public office four years ago. It was altogether fitting that Rea gan should open his campaign at a Labor Day picnic, the traditional hunting grounds for Democratic votes. The Governor won about 25 or 30 per cent of the labor vote in 1966, and that helped provide his margin of victory in a state that still has a majority of registered Democrats. In California, as in many states, the labor vote remains crucial, the cele brated “Great Silent Majority” torn between its Democratic past and ap parently Republican future. As they sat there in the simmering Orange County heat, the retail clerks were obviously ripe for Reagan's plucking. They are scrambling to pay the taxes on those stucco boxes and the repairs on those ’65 automobiles, and welfare is an affront. They are almost as weary of the war as they are of peace marches, but they do not want to see America “lose face.” They want a good education for their kids, but they are appalled at nar cotics in the high schools, demonstra tions in the colleges and sex just about everywhere. They are not poor, at least not the way their parents might have been poor; some do play golf or go boating. But they are cer tainly not rich, and probably not even very secure. They are not miserable, but they are not very happy, either, and they are confused by the “egg heads” who tell them the values they were taught to believe in do not hold any more. They are basically decent people, but they have a capacity for hate when the neat patterns of their lives are disrupted. When you look at them you have a feeling you've seen them before: yelling at the kids integrating the high schools of Little Rock or protesting public housing in Queens or throwing rocks at Martin Luther King in Cicero. After Reagan finally disappeared behind the stage of a large amphi theater, the leader of the retail clerks’ union, a pudgy, graying fellow in a two‐tone, mustard‐colored shirt, led the Pledge of Allegiance “to the flag of our great country.” Then he an nounced expansively: “First we'll have a few speeches, then a puppet show and then the highlight of our day, the drawing for some wonderful door prizes.” The first speaker was the only Democratic candidate to brave the wilds of Orange County, State Senator Alfred Alquist, who is running for Lieutenant Governor. Having been relegated to a rank of importance somewhat below that of the puppet show, Alquist could not stir up much enthusiasm. Even his dire warning that “the handwriting is on the wall,” that unemployment and inflation were both rising under the Republicans, did not have much impact. He was like a bumbling comedian trying to fill the time before the bur lesque queen was ready. Finally he finished and Rea gan was on. “Hey, Ronnie,” yelled the crowd, “Hey, Ron nie, baby.” The Governor began by reciting his own union credentials — six terms as president of the Screen Actors Guild—and presenting a scroll to the union for its humanitarian work in local hospitals. It was important, he went on, to recognize “labor's partnership in the free‐enterprise system,” espe cially on Labor Day. “It's kind of wonderful, in our troubled times, to stand up and speak about something so traditional. It seems like so often today that the world we know is coming unglued.” From that note he shifted easily into his standard jokes, which he de livers with impeccable timing. “I've got a new way to stop smog,” he announced, “stop burning down the schools.” And then: “The young people want three political parties, one in power, one out of power and one marching on Sacramento.” For some reason he left out one of his favor ites: “I had a nightmare last night; I dreamed I owned a Laundromat in Berkeley. The main topic of the speech was welfare, and the main message was clear: you, the taxpayer, are getting stuck. “Welfare,” Reagan declared, “is the taxpayer's greatest domestic expense, and it is increasing in cost faster than our revenues can keep pace.” One reason is fraud: 16 per cent of the families receiving Aid for Dependent Children cheated last year, at a cost of $59‐million. More important, he said, “I am also convinced there is a sizable percentage of people who have taken advantage of loopholes in the thousands of overlapping Fed eral regulations to augment their incomes at your ex pense.” Then he recited a few horrible examples: an unmar ried girl who got $400 for an abortion despite her parents’ income, a social worker mak ing $13,700 who received aid under the A.D.C. program, a citizen owning a $30,000 home who was eligible for free sur plus food. These situations, he thundered, are made possible by “self ‐ seeking politicians” who urge organized welfare groups to “make poverty a profession.” And the courts have not helped. When the Supreme Court nullified Cali fornia's one‐year residency re quirement for welfare it cost the State $95‐million a year. The phrases spurted out: “able‐bodied malingerers … special‐interest groups … massive tax drain….” When it was over, the crowd swarmed around Reagan again. A Chicano youth edged his way forward and yelled: “Why don't you do something to help the people in East Los Angeles [the largest Mexican‐American barrio]?” The Governor looked up, but his eyes registered no recognition. He turned quickly to an autograph seeker. “I should never have learned to make anything but an X,” he quipped. A lady in bell‐bottom jeans rushed up and shouted: GOVERNOR REAGAN is giving them hell, or, as he would say, heck. (In public, Reagan blushes when he uses a word as strong as “damn”; in private, he tells off‐color stories with great relish.) His whole style is suited to attack, to criticism. But he has been Governor for 3½ years, and that presents problems. He has to find reasons outside his administration for all the trou ble. Spiraling welfare costs are thus the work of the “profes sional poor,” the courts, the Federal bureaucracy. Campus unrest is caused by “revolu tionaries” determined to “tear down the system” and admin istrators who “appease” them. But Reagan must still run on his record, and I went to Sac ramento one day to talk to him about his tenure. I saw Reagan in his office, a richly paneled room with old hunting prints and bullet proof windows. He has a rep utation for being a very diffi cult man to interview, and many capital reporters no longer bother. (“It's just like hearing the same record over and over again,” said one, “I don't think he knows how to be candid.”) When I checked the notes of my own inter view, I found that most of what he said had come prac cally word‐for‐word from old speeches. Ronald Reagan takes an essentially negative approach to government. He has said many times that his major goal is “cutting the cost of government. This should be the top priority of every administration.” And this is probably the most significant impact he has made on Cali fornia. After he took office, he was faced with such a huge budget deficit that he had to ask for the largest tax in crease in state history (an increase that conveniently pro duced enough surplus to per mit a tax rebate in time for the election this year). But ever since, he has been slash ing away at the government with great gusto. When I asked what accomplishment he was proudest of, he said: “We're a growing state — got a million more people than we had when I started — and that had been the excuse for years and years for the increase in the size of the state government. Better than 5,000 employes were added to the State pay roll every year. Well, we've been here 3½ years and there are fewer employes than when started.” The major issue in the state is, and has been since Reagan started campaigning against the “mess in Berkeley” in 1966, education. After his elec tion, the Governor set the tone for his administration when he engineered the firing of Clark Kerr, the president of the University of California, and announced that the State should not “subsidize intellec tual curiosity.” This prompted The Los Angeles Times, which had supported his candidacy, to declare that, “an anti intellectual political reaction ary now governs California and is determined to bring higher‐education growth to a grinding halt.” To many ob servers, the last three years have borne out The Times's prediction. As student unrest spread from Berkeley to the university's other eight cam puses, Reagan escalated his attacks. He says occasionally that students have some “le gitimate” gripes, particularly the size of classes and the in accessibility of professors. But in general he has denied the validity of student complaints. Young people are “indoctri nated” by left‐wing profes sors, he insists, and “march only to disrupt.” In heated moments his rhetoric would make President Nixon's epi thet “bums” sound positively charitable. He has called stu dent “brats,” “freaks” and “cowardly fascists,” and last spring, in discussing order on campus, he said: “If it takes a bloodbath, let's get it over with. No more appeasement.” a “figure of speech” and that anyone who took it seriously was “neurotic.” Within a few days, four students were shot at Kent State. DESPITE the opposition of many California liberals, Rea gan's stand on campus disrup tion is extremely popular. One of his chief campaign strate gists put it this way: “Campus unrest is an issue between Reagan and the people with nobody in between. They un derstand what he's saying. Reagan is a polarizing politi cian, much more than Nixon. With Nixon, there are all shades of gray, but that's not the way Reagan operates—he lays it out there. This campus unrest issue is really bugging a lot of people. Hell, they didn't go to college, but they want their kids to go, and they're paying for the State system. And it lust outrages them to see a building burned down. They have no way of really understanding the legit imate student complaints be cause they never went to college and they have no un derstanding of what happens on a college campus. The first reaction on every poll I can show you is, ‘Throw the s.o.b.'s out.’” But education in California is more than a political issue. Many people fear Reagan is destroying the university. He has consistently cut its budget requests by about 20 per cent, and construction funds have been slashed even deeper. Moreover, his attacks on the university have helped create a climate in which the Legis lature found it popular to ex empt professors from a 5 per cent pay raise granted all other State employes. Univer sity President Charles J. Hitch, commenting on his budget for next year, said: “The first thing these cuts mean is that our students will get a short changed education—not only next year, but as the effects of this action take hold and deplete the university for many years after that.” He held out the possibility that some qualified students would have to be turned away— something California vowed would never happen. As Rea gan has gained control of the Board of Regents, he has exerted more influence over the university. At his urging, the regents last year took away from the nine chancel lors the final power to ap point faculty. Last spring they used that power to delay the promotion of two radical pro fessors, and more such cases are expected. Also last spring the Governor led the fight against Angela Davis, the young black Communist who was appointed acting assistant professor of philosophy at U.C.L.A. The regents finally fired Miss Davis, even though the courts had said that she could not be dismissed for her political beliefs. (Several weeks later Miss Davis was linked to the shoot‐out in which a judge was killed in a San Rafael courtroom; she fled, but was arrested in a New York motel 10 days ago.) The regents also vowed a crackdown on student news papers and ordered the chan cellors to prepare rules that would prohibit “socio‐political advocacy” and “the dissemi nation of lewd, obscene ar ticles and photographs” by student journalists. Faculty morale is plummeting. Estab lished teachers are leaving, good young ones are hesitant to come. “Crisis” is too mild a word to describe the situation. The decline of the univer sity is undoubtedly hastened by the tactics of those who feel that throwing a rock through a window is a valid expression of political belief. Reagan and the radicals need and use each other. The vio lent student minority gives the Governor a chance to vent his moral outrage and avoid the deeper problems bothering students. And Rea gan's rhetoric and actions and those of the police reinforce the radicals’ contention that California is on the brink of fascism, enabling them to gather wide support on cam pus. The only ones who lose are those in the middle. REAGAN knows who his constituents are. He placed top priority this year on a tax‐reform bill that would have lowered property taxes “He holds out the hope that an those problems that make the evening news so unpleasant will solve themselves.” for the 65 per cent of the pop ulation who own homes. The reduction would have been fi nanced mainly by an increased sales tax—a regressive levy that hits the poor hardest. (The bill was blocked by Dem ocratic legislators who insist ed — against Reagan's ada mant opposition — that a tax increase be used to aid educa tion.) At the same time, Rea gan endorsed a bill that in creased the take for race track owners and reduced the State's share of track reve nues. He also advocated a higher tax on public power companies, saying they have an unfair advantage over pri vate power, and a reduction of the State's business‐inven tory tax. Business, he told an Anaheim audience, “is al ready being sand‐bagged by the Federal Government.” If its taxes are raised too much it would be like “killing the goose that lays the golden egg.” When he opened his cam paign, Reagan listed the issues this way: “Taxes and tax re lief, the size and cost of gov ernment, the continuing effort to cut those costs, the State's role in helping to finance and provide the best education for our children, the progress we've made in getting tougher laws and tougher judges to protect the citizen, his family and property, the work being done to protect the magical environment of California, the programs to build and expand the California economy so there are jobs and job oppor tunities for our people …” Not one word about poverty, slums, disease, discrimination, job training or justice. Listen ing to Ronald Reagan, it is possible to imagine that blacks or Chicanos or Indians do not really exist in California—ex cept as welfare chiselers or threats to “family and prop erty.” He has always main tained that racial integration is a “desirable result,” but he opposes open‐housing legisla tion and the busing of school children. Last winter, in talk ing about the integration of minority groups, he said: “As we bring them up to where they have the economic means to follow the trend to the suburbs and to move and dis perse from some of these com munities, we are going to find that this problem to a large extent solves itself.” In many ways, this is the essence of Reagan's appeal. He holds out the hope that all those troublesome problems that make the evening news so unpleasant will solve them selves. “For many years now,” he said in his inaugural address, “you and I have been shushed like children and been told there are no simple answers to the complex prob lems which are beyond our comprehension. Well, the truth is, there are simple answers.” In fact, he implies, many of those problems do not even exist. Students are unhappy not because of an insane war or distorted na tional priorities but because they are “indoctrinated.” Taxes go up not because so ciety has a responsibility to the underprivileged, but be cause people are cheating on welfare. A liberal Republican politician explained it this way: “What the people really want is for all this turmoil to go away, and they go wild about a man who promises to do everything to dispel that turmoil. What the Great Si lent Majority wants most of all is silence. They don't want to get involved, they want things the way they used to be. As a politician, Reagan is a great psychiatrist. He puts the voter on the couch and says soothingly, ‘You're great, why don't they appreciate you?’ He's like a medicine Man with his little bottle of elixir that will make every thing go away—those fuzzy wuzzy blacks staring at you on the 11 o'clock news and those professors who keep saying how smart they are and how dumb you are. He's a boy with his finger in the dike, holding back the future.” BUT Reagan is even more subtle than that. He gives people a reason to feel good about their lives. In a recent speech to the state Chamber of Commerce he said: “We have been picked at, sworn at, rioted against and down graded until we have a built in guilt complex, and this has been compounded by the ac cusations of our sons and daughters who pride them selves on telling it like it is. Well, I have news for them— in a thousand social‐science courses they have been in formed the way it is not'…. As for our generation, I will make no apology. No people in all history paid a higher price for freedom. And no people have done so much to advance the dignity of man. … We are called materialis tic. Maybe so…. But our materialism has made our children the biggest, tallest, most handsome and intelli gent generation of Americans yet. They will live longer with fewer illnesses, learn more, see more of the world and have more successes in real izing their personal dreams and ambitions than any other people in any other period of our history—because of our ‘materialism.’” Reagan understands the spiritual values of his people —thrift, hard work, caution, security. He also understands that they are patriotic, that they believe their country has a mission and that through that mission they will some how transcend their limited lives. “Manifest destiny” is one of the most basic ideas in American history, and sel dom has it been stated in a purer form than when Ronald Reagan said recently: “I think on our side is civi lization and on the other side is the law of the jungle … We all have to recognize that this country has been handed the responsibility, greater than any nation in all history, to preserve some 6,000 years of civilization against the barbarians.” That statement was not concocted for political effect. It reflects, as much as any thing he has ever said, Rea gan's view of the world. “You know,” one of his aides once told me, “Ronnie really does believe in good and evil.” And he believes in his role as a defender of the good. “The trouble with Reagan,” said one politician, “is that he can't decide whether he was born in a log cabin or a man ger.” The Governor's finely honed sense of the apocalyptic comes bursting through in his campaign rhetoric. In talking about welfare abuses to a luncheon at the Elks Club in Napa, he said: “We should all clearly understand the stakes in this economic and social ‘Battle of Armageddon.’ What we are fighting for is the sur vival of our system.” Reagan's obvious sincerity is one of his greatest political assets. One of his campaign organizers said recently: “I'm not really concerned that the campaign will be decided on issues. It will be decided on image. If we can get people to believe that Ron is still try ing to put forth a point of view, that he's still trying to get things done, we'll win with no trouble. He's just a straight guy trying to do a job.” A week later the Cali fornia Poll, conducted by Mervin Field, affirmed that view. What the voters liked most about Reagan was not what he said but how he said it. Thirty per cent of those questioned by Field said Rea gan's strongest point was among the following: “speaks his mind, honest, sincere, straightforward, decisive.” The most important substantive issue, campus unrest, was mentioned by only 19 per cent of the respondents. THIS image of sincerity comes across with great power, particularly on TV. Thus Reagan's strategy is similar to Nixon's in 1968: reach the voter, as one aide said, through as few “sieves” as possible. That means a large budget for packaged television ads. And it means grabbing free TV time when ever possible (except to de bate Unruh). Bill Boyarsky, the Associated Press's former bureau chief in Sacramento and the author of a book on Reagan, has said: “If we pen and‐pencil reporters catch him at the airport alone, we get no story. But if the TV cam eras are there, he turns it on, and he talks right to the cam era. That's why you see him on TV so much, because he's provocative and he goes places where TV covers things.” The most damaging thing to a candidate of this sort is a critical analyst—a “sieve” that filters his message. Rea gan likes television because he can communicate directly with the people, but also be cause TV newsmen seldom have the time or the expertise to interpret what he is saying. Like Vice President Agnew, Reagan has conducted a cam paign in California to discredit the writing press, which does have the capacity for criti cism. At almost every stop he will say something like, “I don't mean to imply that these reporters don't write the truth, but …” Writers who are critical of the Governor often find themselves isolated by the staff. One correspond ent recently received a letter from Paul Beck, the Gover nor's press secretary, who in formed him that he would no longer receive any official co operation in covering the campaign. Reagan is, of course, a pro fessional TV performer (for several years before his first gubernatorial campaign, he was the host of the television show “Death Valley Days,” a job that he concedes was like “subsidized retirement”). But expertise alone does not ex plain his success. The main reason he communicates so well with his people is that he genuinely shares so many of their values and outlooks. His official campaign biogra phy has been doctored a bit— his first marriage to actress Jane Wyman, their two chil dren and their divorce have been expunged from the rec ord—but that was hardly necessary. “He is the per sonification of the American dream,” said one assistant. “At a time when everything is in such disarray, people want to know that nice guys don't always finish last.” One of the strongest influ ences in his life is his wife, Nancy, described in her offi cial biography as “a dedicated Wife and mother.” The sketch omits the fact that Mrs. Rea gan, the daughter of a prominent and conservative neurosurgeon in Chicago, was a movie actress before turn ing to the joys of domesticity. No matter. Nancy Reagan is as stern a guardian of public morality as her husband, maybe more stern. She be lieves, for example, that an abortion is “committing mur der.” When an interviewer recently asked her about a woman who has no choice about having a baby she re plied: “But she does have a choice. It starts with a move ment of the head, either yes or no. This cheap, easy thing they say—that I can do What ever I want sexually and not take responsibility—I don't agree with that at all.” Wom en's Lib? “Ridiculous,” said Mrs. Reagan, using one of her husband's favorite words. “They're going to end up being unhappy women.” THE Reagans have simple tastes. Their greatest joy is horseback riding, which they do as often as possible in the Malibu hills. (They once owned a ranch in the area, which they recently sold to 20th Century Fox, but they've re tained the right to keep horses there. The ranch is only a short drive from their home in Pacific Palisades, where they stay on weekends.) After din ner they often watch televi sion. One day riding in the campaign bus I asked Reagan what shows he liked. His reply: “I'm not able to get out riding as often as I used to, so even if a show is lousy, I like it if it has plenty of horses and outdoor scenes. Some of them are made on the Fox ranch, and I can pick out trails I made 15 years ago.” The Reagans’ 17‐year‐old daughter, Patti, who has been away at boarding school, en tered Ohio University this fall, but when the kids—Patti and her 12‐year‐old brother, Skipper—are around, the fam ily likes to go out to the movies or screen one at home. “I call up my friends at the studios to see if a film is all right for the kids,” Reagan said, “but so many of them are rated X these days my friends have to say no.” Reagan and his wife are both ardent foes of film frank ness. “A kiss is only beauti ful to the people doing it,” he said, “it's pretty ugly to some one watching it.” Two of his recent favorites were “Patton” and “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.” “Patton was so totally honest, nothing con trived, it really happened,” Reagan explained. Then with a frown he added: “I've never understood the avant garde person who likes the most ab stract painting and says ‘Use your head,’ and then justifies going to the bathroom in the street because it's ‘realism.’” Reagan is also a man of great personal charm. He is smooth and self‐possessed, but not too smooth; his speech is flecked with enough slurred words and homey expressions to make him seem human, ap proachable. Total strangers just naturally call him “Ron nie.” It is the “aw, shucks” school of politics, and it works —well, like a charm. For in stance, in recalling his days as host of the General Electric TV Theater, Reagan mentions his opposite number at West inghouse by calling himself “the Betty Furness of G. E.” The audiences roar at the line. They don't rip off his cuff links or muss his hair, they just like him. “Delivery is half of the game,” said one of Reagan's confidants. “Agnew is a little too harsh. Barry Goldwater was a little too feisty, he laid down a chal lenge every time he spoke. Ron comes across as reason able. In 1966 he said the same things Barry said in 1964, but he said them in a reasonable manner.” In 1966 Reagan called him self a “citizen politician,” and in announcing his bid for re election he said he was “just a citizen temporarily in public service.” That may be so, but few observers of California politics doubt that he has be come a highly competent poli tician, managed by the best professionals around. He was first urged to run for public office by a group of conservative millionaires, including the late Cy Rubel of Union Oil; Holmes Tuttle, a Ford dealer and finance chair man of Reagan's current cam paign; Henry Salvatori, who made his money in oil ex ploration; Leonard Firestone of the rubber company, and Taft Schreiber, vice president of the Music Corporation of America and Reagan's first theatrical agent. It is difficult to judge the continuing influ ence of these men, dubbed by the press his “kitchen cabi net.” They did, for example, band together with about a dozen others to buy a house for Reagan when Nancy de cided the Executive Mansion in Sacramento was a “fire trap.” (Reagan pays $1,200 a month rent.) They can usually talk to the Governor when they want to, but they do not seem to have much power. “All they really get is recog “They go to the Governor's house for dinner once in a while; their wives love that stuff.” AT campaign time, at least, the most important influence on Reagan is Spencer‐Roberts, the political‐management team that has revolutionized the business of winning elections. Squirreled away in a nonde script office building in down town Los Angeles, with a Nor man Rockwell drawing of Ronald Reagan in the foyer, Stu Spencer maps the basic strategy of the campaign. (Bill Roberts is working full‐time on the re‐election campaign of Senator George Murphy.) A rough‐talking, short‐haired cynic with tattoos on his arm, Spencer will not talk for attribution but his basic mode of operation is well known. The key is information.

ght a team of telephone op erators calls a selected sample of voters and asks them a series of questions. The re sults of this procedure, called “tracking,” are fed into a computer. The computer then prints out, in considerable de tail, what the people of Cali fornia are thinking. At the beginning of the campaign, Spencer could gauge within a week or 10 days the impact his candidate was having. If more money is invested, the lead time can be cut to 24 hours. The Reagan people insist that the main criterion for selecting a campaign issue is the Governor's feeling about it; what the voters want to hear, as revealed by the tracking, is only secondary. But they admit that there is a remarkable correlation be tween the Governor's impulses and the results of the surveys. When pressed, they cannot think of a discrepancy. To the Governor's more bitter critics, this means that he is “com pletely programed,” a man without a mind of his own. The Governor himself will oc casionally say something like, “I'm in the hands of people who …” This is partly true, but it ignores the fact that Reagan's thinking meshes so well with that of his con stituents. He does not need a computer to tell him that peo ple are upset about campus violence or pornography; he is, too. The best example of switch ing signals because of the tracking surveys was the con servation issue. Last year voters started identifying the environment as a major con cern, and Reagan jumped on the bandwagon. “But you know,” said one adviser, “the polls show a direct correla tion between interest in the environment and the smog season. When the air clears up they forget about it. That shows you something about the electorate.” As the campaign acceler ates, Reagan is in an excellent political position. He has thrown a blanket of unity over the Republicans that covers — some would say smothers — just about every one. Even former Senator Thomas Kuchel, whom Reagan helped depose in 1968, recent ly endorsed him (while refus ing to endorse Senator Mur phy). As one lady at a fund raising party told me, “He is everything to everyone.” A moderate like Kuchel responds to his apparent reasonableness and flexibility, as exemplified by the conservation issue and his willingness, after years of stanch opposition, to endorse the withholding of state in come taxes. The Los Angeles Times, a traditionally Repub lican paper, also endorsed him again, saying: “The great ma jority of Californians are peo ple of the center—moderate, reasonable people who want pragmatic solutions to real problems.The Governor's con duct in office has shown his growing awareness of these realities and a growing flexi bility in meeting them.” At the same time, the right re mains mollified by his ada mant stand on such issues as school busing. After his re nomination, for instance, he was asked to comment on George Wallace's campaign for Governor of Alabama. He hemmed and hawed and fi nally muttered: “Well, let's just say I wouldn't have cam paigned that way.” Hardly a devastating critique. IN contrast, Jess Unruh has split his party, or rather, he has failed to heal the gaping wounds of the past. As Speak er of the Assembly for many years, “Big Daddy” Unruh was an extremely powerful man who made many lasting ene mies. In particular, he fought bitterly with former Governor Pat Brown, and this year some of Brown's friends and money raisers are sitting the election out or openly backing Reagan. Since his association with Robert Kennedy in 1968, how ever, Unruh seems to have undergone a conversion—he is, for instance, strongly against the war. But many of the liberals he despised for so long remain highly suspicious. As he moved from the back rooms of Sacramento to the TV screen, Unruh shed about 100 pounds, got his teeth fixed and polished up his delivery, though he remains a rather dull speaker, with little humor or charisma. And like many Democrats this year, he has found money about as scarce as a welfare recipient at a Reagan rally. (Reagan has had no trouble raising a budget that his advisers put at $1.5‐ million, a figure some observ ers feel is too small.) Unruh has no plans to buy TV time. Instead, he is count ing on free coverage, and that has forced him into some blundering attempts at the dramatic. During the first week of the campaign he led a troupe of newsmen to the mansion of Henry Salvatori, Reagan's best‐known million aire friend, to charge that the Governor's tax‐reform pro posal would have saved Sal vatori almost $5,000. The figures were right, but, un fortunately for Unruh, Salva tori and his wife were home. They rushed outside and de nounced him—as the cameras rolled — for invading private property. ‘We earned our money,” shouted Mrs. Salva tori, who has a heart condi tion. Unruh's real problem, of course, is Reagan. “Our main frustration,” said one Demo cratic official, “is getting Rea gan to come to grips with an issue so we can draw clear distinctions between our pol icy and his. Reagan is so vague and so glib that he makes the issue whether he's a good guy or not. It's aw fully difficult to present a clear choice to the voters.” Reagan is clearly weak on two issues. The first is educa tion. There are signs that people are beginning to real ize that it is their kids who are attending second ‐ rate schools and suffering because the State will not increase its contribution to local school districts. At the last minute, Reagan found some more money for schools in the budget, and he has promised “At campaign time, the most important influence on Reagan is Spencer‐Roberts, the political management team.” to deal with the problem next year. Meanwhile, Los Angeles sc►ools had to cut a period out of the class day this year because of the financial squeeze. More important is the economy. California's unem ployment, fueled by cutbacks in the aerospace industry, is a full percentage point above the national average. And even Reagan's advisers admit: “Every poll shows that the voters think the Democrats are better at handling the economy.” For the time being, the advisers point out, unem ployment has affected rela tively few people, and they are confident they can ride out the storm. But if things get bad, they say, “We'll just start attacking Nixon, that's all we can do.” On the other side, the Dem ocrats concede that rising un employment and inflation are their only real hope, even though Reagan is hardly to blame for economic ills. “If there's something close to a depression, Jess has a chance,” said one party official. Another Democrat com mented: “It's all a question of which fears you play on—the fear of an economic disaster or the fear of the kids and the blacks.” ASSUMING that Reagan does win again, where does he go from there? A recent na tional column said that he was deliberately staking out a position to the right of Nixon, using the welfare issue, in the hope that the President would falter by 1972 and be vulner able to a challenge. In 1976, the reasoning goes, Reagan would be 65, too old to run. It is doubtful that Reagan would be quite so calculating But, though he knows as well as anyone that Nixon is an odds‐on bet to run again in ’72, the dream of national office that flared briefly in 1968 has not died completely. There are plenty of men around Reagan who still wonder, “What if something should happen …” Reagan says he is not one of them. He insists that he loves California and would never leave. But he was willing to run in 1968, and most observ ers believe he could be pre vailed upon to take another grab at the brass ring. Since 1968, of course, there's been another factor: Spiro Agnew. To a signficant extent, the Vice President has usurped Reagan's potential national constituency; the Governor seems to get few out‐of‐state speaking invitations these days. If something should happen to Nixon, it is ques tionable whether Reagan could beat Agnew for the nomina tion, assuming Agnew wanted it. The other possibility is for Reagan to run for the Senate in 1974 against the incum bent, Alan Cranston. The Sen ate would suit Reagan's pref erence for speech ‐ making over administration, and by that time his children would be older, freeing him for more travel. But it is no secret that Robert Finch is hungering to take on Cranston and would probably have Nixon's bless ing. When he was elected Lieutenant Governor of Cali fornia in 1966, Finch ran ahead of Reagan, and the out come of a primary fight is by no means certain. Meanwhile, Ronald Reagan is still a hero to California's millions, chief executive of the nation's largest state — no small achievement in itself. “This is quite a place to be,” he told an interviewer recent ly, and he undoubtedly meant it. But maybe Reagan's great est role is neither George Gipp nor Governor of California, but the Lone Ranger, riding in on his white horse, solving the problem in time for the cereal commercial and leaving a silver bullet behind. One can almost hear them, standing in the yard of their stucco bunga low," talking in hushed tones as the stranger rides into the distance. “Who was that masked man?” “Don't you know? That was Rimald Reagan.”""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Communist Slate Is State's First Since ’46,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/25/archives/communist-slate-is-states-first-since-46-places-on-ballot-won-by.html,"Arnold Johnson is running for United States Senator from New York. During his campaign —in fact on his 66th birthday Sept. 23—the House of Repre sentatives cited him for con tempt of Congress. Mr. Johnson, whose case is still pending in the Justice De partment, is the nominee of the Communist party, which is run ning statewide candidates here for the first time since 1946. The party is on the ballot by petition, as are two other Marx ist parties—the Socialist Work ers, following Leon Trotsky's line, and the 80‐year‐old Social ist Labor party, stemming from Daniel DeLeon's Industrial Un ionism party. In their last races for state wide office in 1968, the Social ist Labor party polled 7,964 votes for John Emanuel for Senator, and the Socialist Workers 4,979 for Mrs. Hedda Garza for that office. Both failed to get on last fall's city ballot, when the Com munists ran a mayoral candi date for the first time since 1966, Rasheed Storey polling 4,018 for that office and Jesus Colon 7,574 for city Controller. In the current campaign, the Communists have called for an immediate end of the war in Vietnam, using national re sources instead for housing and jobs. They also assert that working people need their own candidates. Mr. Johnson urges the defeat of James L. Buck ley, his Conservative rival, as a mandate to reverse Nixon Agnew policies. The Socialist Workers also advocate an immediate with drawal from Vietnam. They stress women's liberation, in cluding free abortion on de mand and 24‐hour child care centers. They urge forming black and Puerto Rican parties for community control. They propose “dismantling of the state of Israel” and self‐deter mination for Palestinians. The Socialist Labor party's state secretary, Mrs. Doris Val entine, says the party warns of capitalism's taking all human ity “into oblivion,” and pro poses a government of repre sentatives elected from indus tries to operate the economy for benefit instead of profit. For Governor, the Commu nists have named Mr. Storey, Brooklyn black, their 34‐year‐ old fulltime state chairman. Mr. Johnson, their Senate choice, is the party's national relations director; he served a Federal prison sentence from 1955 to 1957 on Smith Act charges of conspiracy to teach forcible overthrow of the government. The current citation against Mr. Johnson is for his refusal to answer House Internal Secu rity Committee questions on the New Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam when he asserted that it lacked juris diction. The Communist ticket in cludes Mrs. Grace Mora New man, 43, a Bronx housewife, for Lieutenant Governor. In Decem ber, 1966, Mrs. Newman tray led to North Vietnam to inves tigate American bombing. The Socialist Workers ticket is led by Clifton DeBerry, 48, another Brooklyn black, who was the party's candidate for President in 1964 and who works as a house painter when not campaigning. The Senate candidate is Kipp Dawson, 30, party organizer, who turned to radical politics at San Francisco State College and in 1967 was a national coordinator of the Student Mobolization Commit tee to End the War in Vietnam. Statewide, the Socialist Workers have also named for Lieutenant Governor Jonathan Rothschild, 30, a Manhattan taxi driver; Controller, Ruthann Miller, 30, Manhattan women's liberationist, and Attorney Gen eral, Miguel Padilla, 31, of the Bronx, a City College student. The Socialist Labor party's candidate for Governor is Ste phen Emery, 62, of Jamaica, Queens, recently retired as city subway dispatcher.

The Cultural Contradiction,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/27/archives/the-cultural-contradiction.html,"The ultimate support for any social system is the acceptance by the popu lation of a moral justification of au thority. The older justifications of bourgeois society lay in the defense of private property. But the “new capital ism” of the twentieth century has lacked such moral grounding. It is in this context that one can see the weakness of corporate capitalism in trying to deal with some of the major political dilemmas of the cen tury. The issues here are not primarily economic but sociocultural. The tradi tionalist defends fundamentalist reli gion, censorship, stricter divorce, and anti‐abortion laws; the modernist is for secular rationality, freer personal relations, tolerance of sexual deviance, and the like. Now, the curious fact is that the “new capitalism” of abundance, which emerged in the 1920's, has never been able to define its view of these cultu ral‐political issues. Given its split char acter, it could not do so. Its values derive from the traditionalist past, and its language is the archaism of the Protestant Ethic. The fact that the corporate economy has no unified value system of its own, or still mouthed a flaccid version of Protestant virtues, meant that liberal ism could go ideologically unchal lenged. But liberalism today is in trouble. Not only in politics, where its prag matic style has been found wanting, but in an arena where it had joined in support of capitalism—in the econ omy. The economic philosophy of American liberalism had been rooted in the idea of growth. The liberal answer to social prob lems such as poverty was that growth would provide the resources to raise the incomes of the poor. The thesis that growth was necessary to finance public services was the center of John  Kenneth Galbraith's book “The Afflu ent Society.” And yet, paradoxically, it is the very idea of economic growth that is now coming under attack—and from lib erals. Affluence is no longer seen as an answer. Growth is held responsible for the spoliation of the environment, the voracious use of natural resources, the crowding in the recreation areas, the densities in the city, and the like. One finds, startlingly, the idea of zero economic growth—or John Stuart Mill's idea of the “stationary state”— now proposed as a serious goal of government policy. American society faces a number of crises. Yet these crises, I believe, are manageable (not solvable; what prob lems are?) if the political leadership is intelligent and determined. The re sources are present (or will be, once the Vietnam war is ended) to relieve many of the obvious tensions and to finance the public needs of the society. The great need here is time, for the social changes which are required (a decent welfare and income mainte nance system for the poor, the reor ganization of the universities, the con trol of the environment) can only be handled within the space of a decade or more. It is the demand for “instant solu tions” which, in this respect, is the source of political trouble. But the deeper and more lasting crisis is the cultural one. Changes in moral temper and culture—the fusion of imagination and life‐styles (now so celebrated by Charles Reich of Yale)— are not amenable to “social engineer ing” or political control. They derive from the value and moral traditions of the society, and these cannot be “designed” by precept. The ultimate sources are the religious conceptions which undergird a society; the proxi mate sources are the “reward systems” and “motivations” (and their legiti macy) which derive from the arena of work (the social structure). American capitalism has lost its tra ditional legitimacy which was based on a moral system of reward, rooted in a Protestant sanctification of work. It has substituted a hedonism which promises a material ease and luxury, yet shies away from all the historic implications which a “voluptuary sys tem”—and all its social permissiveness and libertinism—implies. The characteristic style of an Indus trial society is based on the principles of economics and economizing: on effi ciency, least cost, maximization, opti mization, and functional rationality. Yet it is at this point that it comes into sharpest conflict with the cultural trends of the day. The one emphasizes functional rationality, technocratic de cision‐making, and meritocratic re wards. The other, apocalyptic moods and antirational modes of behavior. It is this disjunction which is the historic crisis of Western society. This cultural contradiction, in the long run, is the deepest challenge to the society.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ABORTION HURDLES SCORED BY DOCTOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/28/archives/abortion-hurdles-scored-by-doctor-he-cites-colleagues-who-obstruct.html,"HOUSTON, Oct. 27—A pro fessor of obstetrics at Co lumbia University sharply crit icized today some hospitals and some of his physician col leagues for their attitudes in making “it as difficult as they can for a woman to get an abortion.” The obstetrician, Dr. Robert E. Hall, said that they were doing so by making the pro cedure too expensive, too time consuming and too restrictive. “The major effect of abor tion liberalization on the [American] medical community has been not to broaden its views but to polarize them,” Dr. Hall said at a session on abortion at a meeting of the American Public Health As sociation here. However, Dr. Hall empha sized in an interview that New York physicians “have done a darn good job” in coping with the logistics of the sudden de mand for abortion that began last July when state legislation permitted them to do such pro cedures. Yet in “every hospital, no matter how large the [obste trical] staff, there seem to be two or three doctors who do more than half the abortions,” he said, “and the rest of the staff regards these doctors with esteem not markedly higher than that previously served for the back street abortionist.” Social Obligations Though some of these phys icians may be partly motivated by “greed,” he said, most doc tors do abortions because they recognize their social as well as medical obligations. But their colleagues, who. Dr. Hall said, do an occasional abortion on the daughters of friends, “still cling” to the be lief that “they, not pregnant women, should decide who should have an abortion.” Not only has the new abor tion legislation affected the older practicing obstetrician, Dr. Hall said, but it has also had its impact on younger doctors training as residents in obstetrics and gynecology. Though these residents “gen erally accept the idea of abor tion in principle,” Dr. Hall said, “they claim that doing several abortions a day for a few months interferes with their over‐all training experi ence.” Though there is some justi fication for this attitude, Dr. Hall said, “one becomes a little skeptical of this explanation on learning that they would be more willing to do hospital, abortions if remunerated for their work, that they are almost universally eager to moonlight in abortion clinics at $12.50 an hour and that they certainly intend to do abortions in their private prac tices.” Dr. Edmund W. Overstreat of the University of California School of Medicine said that obstetric residents in San Fran cisco also had “complained in creasingly about distortion of teaching programs.” As a result of California's new therapeutic abortion act, many hospitals in that state are using slack time, such as weekends, to cope with de mand that has soared from about 600 therapeutic abor tions a year until 1967 to an estimated 75,000 for 1970. The result, Dr. Overstreet said, is “a revolution for which physicians and hospital facili ties were almost totally un prepared.” Dr. Overstreet said that some of California's smaller community hospitals, which are “fearful of being tagged as abortion mills,” have set week ly quotas on the number of abortion patients. The remainder of patients, he said, are shunted to larger metropolitan hospitals where doctors are performing as many as 150 legal abortions each month “to the increased detriment of their own general medical services.” Dr. Overstreet said that de spite attempts to “simplify and speed up legal abortion pro cedures,” about 25 per cent of “our patients are not seen until, after the 12th weeks of preg nancy.” The medical profession, he said, has not “yet done an adequate job of educating the public to the importance of applying for abortion early in pregnancy.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Parley of American Lutheran Church Backs Use of the Title ‘Bishop’,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/28/archives/parley-of-american-lutheran-church-backs-use-of-the-title-bishop.html,"SAN ANTONIO, Tex., Oct. 27 —The American Lutheran Church overwhelmingly ap proved in principle today the use of the title “Bishop” by its top leaders. Acting during the closing moments of a week‐long bien nial general convention, dele gates of the 2.6‐member denomination “encouraged” its 18 district presidents to use the designation “both formally and informally.” Once the church council, the policy‐making arm of the church between conventions, judges the practice to be “suf ficiently accepted,” a future convention will be asked to legalize the practice by consti tutional change. As a token of intent, the 1,000 delegates, by a unani mous vote, named their outgoing and in effect, the first “Bishop emeritus.” He is the Rev. Dr. Fredrik A. Schiotz, president of the church for the last 10 years and, in effect, the first bishop in the history of Lutheranism in this country. The resolution approving in principle the establishment of an episcopacy in the American Lutheran Church endeavored to put at ease those churchgoers who might resent what could appear to them as a move toward a hierarchy similar to the Roman Catholic Church. Support Not Implied The resolution declared that the use of “ecclesiastical no menclature” does not imply sup port for the apostolic succes sion nor does it endorse life time tenure. In the Roman Catholic Church as well as in Anglican Churches, bishops are regard ed as part of an unbroken line starting from the earliest days of Christianity. Bishops of both churches are named for life. Virtually all Lutheran church es in Europe and many in Afri ca and Asia have traditional ly designated their leaders as “Bishops.” However, in this country, the title “president” was preferred by early immi grating Lutherans from Scan dinavia in order to demonstrate their zeal for a democratic church. The title “president” con notes an association with in dustry or government rather than the church, in the opinion of many religious leaders. The resolution to adopt an episcopacy in principle came out of a five‐year study of church structure from the lo cal parish to the operation of the church's national offices in Minneapolis. Many, of the recommenda tions, including those that call fcir a drastic reorganization of boards and commissions, were held over for the next biennial. Opposition to a Lutheran ep iscopacy came from a few del egates who saw such a change as broadening the gap between clergy and laity. They also felt that sufficient time had not been given for floor discussion of the episco pacy issue. In the final hours of the week‐long convention, the delegates approved a budget of $23.7‐million for 1971, only $36,000 above the 1970 figure. A statement on Selective Service reform was also adopted. It said, in part: “We believe it is time now to amend the Selective Service Act so as to provide alternate forms of national service to those who object to war on moral and philosophical grounds other than specifically religious considerations. In ad dition we believe it is time also to amend the act to provide alternate forms of national service to those who object on religious, moral and philosophi cal grounds to participation in a specific war. The exercise of moral judgment requires ac ceptance of the principle of selective conscientious objec tion.” A proposed statement advo cating reform of abortion laws was referred for further study. The delegates reaffirmed, how ever, a four‐year‐old statement acknowledging that “there are times and circumstances when interruption of a pregnancy may be necessary for therapeu tic reasons.” The convention met in the, San Antonio Civic Center.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Implant of Human Embryo Appears Near,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/29/archives/implant-of-human-embryo-appears-near-human-embryo-implant-seems.html,"CAMBRIDGE, England, Oct. 27—The day appears to be rapidly approaching when it will be possible to remove egg cells from women un able to bear children, fer tilize them in a laboratory with sperm from their hus bands, culture them into many‐celled embryos and reintroduce them into the womb. In recent weeks this process has been carried through here almost to the stage at which the embryo could be reimplanted in a prospective mother. A re search team at Cambridge University reported earlier that it had grown such em bryos to the eight‐cell and 16‐cell stages before they died. Now a visit to their labora tory has disclosed that they have progressed well beyond that figure, although Dr. Robert G. Edwards, leader of the team, is reluctant to dis close details until the results have appeared in a scientific journal. Dr. Edwards indicated to day in an interview, how ever, that an early attempt to implant such an embryo would be made if tests in preparation did not show an abnormally high rate of ge netic defects in such labora tory‐grown embryos. The immediate goal of the research is to enable women whose oviducts are blocked to bear children. In this fairly common form of ste rility, the egg cells cannot descend from the ovary to the uterus, or womb, in the normal manner. The technique, however, not only promises to aid ster ile women but also makes possible observation in the laboratory of the previously hidden early phases of human gestation. In this way the origins of some birth defects may be come evident—for example, those caused by malfunctions in early cell division. Some specialists in human reproduction also see the method as a way to test new drugs that could cause birth defects. In screening the laboratory grown embryos for genetic de fects, the researchers here must take into account the fact that many of the women seeking to overcome their sterility and therefore pro viding the egg cells are in their thirties or forties, an age group in which women are more apt to produce mon goloid children. Hence the Younger patients will prob ably receive the first im plants. Also, once the implanted embryos have begun to ma ture, small samples of fluid may be removed from the womb by abdominal puncture to determine whether or not there is evidence of mongol ism or other birth defects identifiable by this method. If so, the embryo will be aborted. At last report, there were 49 women under treatment. In 29 of these cases one or more egg cells have been successfully removed, fertil ized and cultured to produce a total of 23 embryos. To determine whether a laboratory embryo is defec tive, its cells must be studied under a microscope during cell division. The removal of cells for such study from a living embryo would endan ger its survival. However, in all the work reported so far the embryo ceased growing on its own before being re moved for study. Nevertheless, interruption of the life process where, for example, a defective em bryo is suspected, will raise ethical issues similar to those of abortion, even though it can be argued that nature does much the same thing in women who produce a mal formed fetus and suffer a miscarriage. Some 15 years ago, it was reported that an Italian, Danieli Petrucci, had grown human embryos to the stage at which a heart beat could be observed. Pioneers in Field His work was allegedly cut short by pressure from the Roman Catholic Church. However, so far as can be determined his efforts were never reported in any scien tific journal, and the whole episode is viewed with con siderable skepticism by other researchers in the field. According to Dr. Edwards, the trail currently being fol lowed in human embryo cul ture was first blazed for rab bits, hamsters and pigs. Dr. Charles Thibault of France, he said, first achieved fertilization of the eggs “in vitro”—that is, within a glass vessel. Then in the nineteen fifties, Dr. M. C. Chang of the Worcester Foundation in Shrewsbury, Mass., was able to implant such fertilized eggs in rabbits and obtain living offspring. Other pioneers in this field have been Dr. John Rock of Harvard University, Dr. Lan drum Shettles of Columbia University and Dr. Howard W. Jones of the Johns Hop kins University who has worked closely with Dr. Edwards. His present collaborators are P. C. Steptoe and J. M. Purdy of the Cambridge Uni versity Physiology Laboratory and the Oldham General Hos pital in Lancashire. Despite the progress that has been made, according to Dr. Edwards, no one has been able to culture any mammals from egg to full de velopment. The barrier is the phase in which the embryo, early in its development, burrows into the uterus wall and establishes its first vital con tact with the mother. This typically occurs a few days after fertilization. An egg can be fertilized and raised to this stage outside the body. But so far this point has not been surpassed without then placing the young embryo within a uterus. Removal of Embryo Likewise, in animals, the embryo and some associated tissue can be removed after implantation in the uterus wall and grown in the labora tory. But no one has achieved the equivalent of initial im plantation (the so‐called yolk‐sac phase) outside the uterus. Dr. Edwards and his col leagues here attribute much of their success to their ability to remove eggs from the prospective mother in the final stages of maturation, that is, just before ovulation. The eggs then apparently complete their maturation satisfactorily when cultured in a suitable laboratory me dium. Some 30 to 32 hours be forehand, the woman is given gonadotropin injections to stimulate maturation in the follicles where the eggs reach maturity. Removal of the eggs is then achieved by making only small openings in the abdo men and using a device that, with flexible glass fibers, en ables the surgeon to illumi nate and observe the region penetrated. 2‐Cell Stage in Mice The eggs thus removed are cultured for from one to four hours before being exposed to sperm cells obtained from the husband. In earlier work here in which D. C. Wittingham of Australia produced living baby mice, he used sperm extracted from a mouse uterus after intercourse to fertilize mouse eggs in vitro. These eggs grew to the two‐cell stage, and were then reintroduced into a fe male mouse to mature. It was suspected that the mys terious process known as capacitation, in which sperm are made capable of pene trating the eggs, was con trolled by uterin fluids. In the current tests, how ever, such fluids are not in volved. Only those from the follicles and other “packag ing” cells surrounding the egg (cumulus and corona cells) are present, apart from a general culturing medium considered favor able to fertilization. From 12 to 15 hours aft er exposure to a droplet of sperm, the eggs are trans ferred to a medium suitable for growth. The most prom ising found so far is a mix ture of a standard tissue cul ture medium (Hams’ F‐10) with serum from the blood of a fetal calf. Mammals are sufficient ly closely related so that the eggs of some species can survive for a time sustained by the uterine fluids of an other. Thus for the last decade it has been possible to ship by air fertilized eggs de rived from champion cows or sheep within the uterus of a rabbit. In this way the herds of Australia, Japan and South Africa have been en riched. Dr. Edwards believes the observations of human em bryo development in vitro are an indication of what happens within a prospec tive mother. Cleavages of Eggs The eggs split into two cells within 38 hours after exposure to sperm. The sec ond cleavage (ta form four cells) occurs before the “age” of 46.5 hours and the third (to eight cells) before 62 hours. The fourth cleav age (to 16 cells) comes with in 85 hours. In the experiments de scribed in Nature, embryos were allowed to continue di viding until no cleavages oc curred for two days. It was then assumed that their de velopment has ceased, and they were removed from study. It was suggested that re moval of the eggs from the follicles at a slightly more mature stage or the use of uterine or oviduct fluids in the culturing medium might be necessary to extend the lifetime. Such an extension has now been achieved al though the experimenters are not ready to publicize the details. What has particularly en couraged the Cambridge group is that their approach is parallel to that which has led to living offspring in ani mals. Early efforts using eggs from surgically removed ovaries failed, and it was only when eggs close to ma turity were extracted from a functioning follicle that they were capable of sustained growth. Embryo Implant Goal Dr. Edwards said in the interview that the time of the first attempt at an embryo implant would depend on microscopic cell examinations of embryos now being pro duced. If they appear normal, im plants will begin almost im mediately since, he explained, it is advisable for some of the older patients to com plete their child‐bearing as soon as possible. However if defective embryos prove numerous, further experi mentation will be necessary. The apparent imminence of such procedures points up the increasing demands upon the physician to exercise moral as well as scientific good judgment. In recent years physicians have acquired the ability to keep physically alive those whose mental life is at an end, leading them often to allow such life to terminate. Their surgical colleagues have explored the transplan tation of hearts from one person to another, knowing that only through such peril ous procedures could they perhaps extend lifetimes and perfect techniques imperfect ly tested on dogs. Now, apparently, the physi cian is about to lay his ma nipulative finger on the most intimate and vital process of all—that of reproduction. It has been forecast by Dr. Bentley Glass of the State University of New York at Stony Brook, former presi dent of the American Asso ciation for the Advancement of Science, that by the end of this century some human be ings will be gestated in the laboratory rather than in the womb. As noted by Dr. Edwards, efforts are being made by Dr. J. C. Daniel of the University of Colorado at Boulder to breach the implantation bar rier that has stood in the way of complete in vitro ges tation. If he is successful, Dr. Glass's forecast May be ful filled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ALLENDE ASSERTS HE'LL ACT SLOWLY,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/30/archives/allende-asserts-hell-act-slowly-says-chile-will-not-move-hastily-on.html,"SANTIAGO, Chile, Oct. 29— President‐elect Salvador Allen de said today that under his left‐wing Government Chile would consider establishment of relations with Communist Governments on a step‐by‐step basis. He also said that nation alizations would be carried out only after each case had been carefully studied. In his first news conference since being elected President by Congress Saturday, Dr. Al lende indicated that the imme diate concern of his Govern ment would be to bolster Chile's shaky internal economy and halt growing unemploy ment. Dr. Allende, a 62‐year‐old So cialist Senator, was unable to announce the formation of a Cabinet, however. Five days re main until he takes over the presidency from Eduardo Frei Montalva, a Christian Demo crat. Political negotiations within Dr. Allende's coalition of four parties, including the Commu nists, and two small left‐wing movements, have been unable to produce agreement on Cab inet posts and heads of key economic agencies. Dr. Allende will receive the presidential sash and take his oath of of fice before Congress Tuesday. In answereing questions today he avoided criticism of the Nixon Administration. He said he attributed “no sig nificance” to the fact that he had not received a congratula tory message from President Nixon, as he had from a wide range of leaders, including Pre mier Chou en‐Lai of Communist China and Pope Paul VI. Dr. Allende said that Charles A. Meyers, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter‐American Af fairs, who will head the United States delegation to his inaugu ration, was “welcome in Chile.” He noted that Mr. Meyer had represented the United States at recent presidential inaugura tions in Colombia and Costa Rica. Covers a Wide Range In his wide ranging news conference, during which he gave improvised, and sometimes witty, answers to 40 questions, Dr. Allende also made these points: ¶Chile does not intend to limit the size of “an embassy of the importance of the United States.” He said the continua tion of the United States mili tary advisory group, now num bering 13 would be determined by the needs of the Chilean armed forces. ¶Chile's decision on relations with Cuba will be made “with out asking the permission” of the Organization of American States. In 1964 all members of the organization except Mexico broke diplomatic relations with Cuba. ¶Establishment or mainten ance of relations with any country will be dictated by Chile's convenience and inter ests. ¶Each case of proposed na tionalization will be studied “in great detail” and expropriations will be by law. Sees Rightist Conspiracy The low‐key tone of Dr. Allen de's answers changed when he was asked about the prosecu tion of the those responsible for the assassination of Gen. Rene Schneider Chereau, Com mander in Chief of Chile's Army. General Schneider was killed by gunmen in what may have been an attempted kid napping two days before Con gress elected Dr. Allende. Dr. Allende said the arrests of a group of suspects, includ ing Roberto Viaux Marambio, a retired Army general who led a brief rebellion in a regiment here last year, had produced proof of a conspiracy by the “ultra‐right and some of the right that is not so ultra” to prevent his election. Dr. Allende said that two plots to assassinate him had been “discovered and thwarted” by his personal security force. He refused to give details on the plots “for obvious reasons of security.” To Press Investigation Under his Government Dr. Allende said, the investigation and prosecution of General Schneider's assassins, which could lead to death sentences under Chilean law, will be “car ride to the ultimate con sequences without vacillation.” Dr. Allende did not shed much light, on the economic pro grams that he intends to put into effect, but he said the main idea was to “give work to 300,000 Chileans who are unemployed.” This country's population is 9.5 million, and the annual per capita income is about $500. Dr. Allende said that alcohol ism, “this country's most se rious social disease, with 200, 000 chronic alcoholics,” and prostitution and widespread il legal abortions, were the result of the failure of the capitalist system in Chile. Delegations from more than 60 countries will be here next week for the inauguration, in cluding one from Cuba headed by Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, minister without portfolio.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Democrats Given Chance to Win State Assembly, but Not Senate",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/31/archives/democrats-given-chance-to-win-state-assembly-but-not-senate.html,"New York State Democrats, winding up their best‐run and best‐financed legislative cam paign in years, are optimistic; about their chances of making substantial gains in both the State Senate and Assembly. They even talk of the possi bility of capturing the Legisla ture, which would require pick ing up five seats in each house. But most observers believe that while winning the Assembly is a decided possibility for the Dem ocrats, it would take a near miracle for the party to capture the Senate. Only twice in the last half century—in 1935 and 1965— have Democrats controlled both houses of the Legislature. Candidates of both parties have nonetheless actively sought third party endorse ments in the struggle for con trol, with Democrats getting mainly Liberal party backing while Republicans get Conserv ative endorsements. The Liberal party's backing enabled the Democrats to win control of the Legislature in 1965. Three years later, Con servative backing enabled the Republicans to regain control by taking the Assembly. As is the case every two years, all seats in both houses are involved in the election. Adding Senate Seats Senate Democrats maintain they can hold all 24 seats they now have, and they have set their sights on possibly ousting Republicans from five of 33 seats. The Democrats believe there is an outside chance for sixth seat. In the Assembly where Re publicans have a 79‐to‐71 edge, the Democrats see a chance of winning a score of seats. Control of the Legislature will be of tremendous importance. Regardless of which‐ party cap tures the governorship, the new apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives and in the state's Assembly and Senate under the 1970 census will be made by state legis lators elected Tuesday. Tax reform, governmental overhaul and other major is sues, many of them pivotal in the state campaign, also will be on the agenda for the coming session. For its part, the Republican leadership maintains it will re tain every seat now held, al though it acknowledges that, in a few instances, the outcome could be close. In the Assembly in 1968, a number of seats were won by several hundred votes. The Republicans, although their opportunities are restrict ed because they are in the ma jority, think they have a chance of gaining two Senate and six Assembly seats. Neither party expects to make significant inroads in the legislative line‐up in New York City, where the Democrats con trol 22 out of 28 Senate seats and 55 out of 68 Assembly seats. In Manhattan, four incum bent Democratic State Senators and one Republican are facing challenges. The Democrats fac ing Republicans, and, in some instances, minor‐party opposi tion, are Paul E. Bookson, who is running against Charles I. Zucker; Manfred Ohrenstein, who is facing Marvin Rosen and Joseph Zaretzki, who is opposed by Jack Rothbaum, Robert Garcials opponent is Jose Rodriguez, who is running on the New Progressive party line. The lone Republican incum bent, Roy M. Goodman, is be ing challenged in the Silk Stocking district by George N. Spitz, a Democrat. Stanley Steingut and Joseph Zaretzki, leaders of the Demo cratic minority in the Assembly and Senate respectively, said in separate interviews this week that a campaign in which attractive candidates focused on the issues had buoyed their hopes. The aggressiveness of number of these candidates, particularly in normally Re publican districts upstate, has aroused concern among Re publicans. Speaker Perry B. Duryea Jr. of the Assembly, for example, acknowledged that the energet ic efforts shown by K. D. Haley, Democrat‐Liberal, in the 110th District in St. Lawrence County had forced Edward J. Keenan, the Republican incum bent who has Conservative hacking to campaign harder than ever — even though he won in 1968 by 4,800 votes. He also noted that Raymond Skuse, who won the 102d Dis trict by 2,200 votes in 1968, will have to work harder this tine even though he, too, has added the Conservative en dorsement. The Democrat in the district, which takes in part of Albany and Rensselaer Counties, is T. W. Brown. Districts Specified But Mr. Duryea says that the Democrats have their share of worries, too, and that the Republicans stand a good chance of winning Democratic seats in the 144th (Erie), the 131st (Monroe), the 122d (Cay uga‐Cortland), the 104th (Al bany‐Schenectady‐Montgomery) the 80th (Bronx) and the 11th (Nassau). In the 144th, Albert 1. Haus heck, elected in 1968 as a Democrat, is running this year as a Republican‐Conservative after breaking with his party to vote with the Republicans for a sales tax increase. In the 122d, the incumbent Demo crat, George M. Michaels, could not win renomination in his own party after switching his vote to make final passage of the abortion bill possible this year. He is running as a Lib eral. Mary Anne Drupsak, Demo crat‐Liberal in the 104th, finds her vote for the same bill being used heavily against her. Paul A. Fino Jr., son of the former Representative and Bronx Republican leader, is the Republican‐Conservative candi date in the 80th. The Demo cratic incumbent, Ferdinand J. Mondello, won two years ago, but had the Conservative nom ination as well that time. Assemblyman Steingut, con ceding work would have to be done in districts in which Mr. Duryea foresaw possible vic tories, expressed confidence that Democrats would win every case. Mr. Steingut indicated that his “best bets” for new Demo cratic seats were the 139th and 147th (both Erie), the 110th (St. Lawrence), the 119th (On ondaga, the 96th (Orange‐ Rockland), the 98th (Dutchess), the 116th (Oneida), the 102d and 103d (Albany) and the 108th (Clinton‐Essex). Several of these districts were carried by the Republicans two years ago by a few hundred votes. Outlook in the Senate On the Senate side, Earl W. Brydges, the majority leader, and his staff see a possibility of winning the seat in the 51st (Monroe) held by James E. Pow ers, Democrat‐Liberal, which had been Republican until 1965; and also of taking the 56th (Erie), represented by James D. Griffin. But Senator Zaretzki stanch ly maintains that the Demo crats can win in the 7th (Nas sau), where Norman Lent, the incumbent Republican, is mak ing a run for Congress this year, as well as in the 12th (Queens), the 37th (Orange‐ Rockland), the 40th (Albany Schoharie) and the 53d (Erie Genesee). Senator William E. Adams in the 53d who was acquitted earlier this, year after standing trial on perjury charges, is seekinats re‐election. The charges [ against him arose from testi mony he gave before a Feder al grand jury during an inves tigation of fraud and corrup t, on in the state's Medicaid program. Senator Zaretzki is less hope ful about the Democrats’ chance of upsetting Senator John D. (Calandra in the 33d District of the Bronx. He is the Bronx Republican chairman running with Conservative endorsement. Both Repuolicans and Demo crats have conducted a cam paign independent of the op eration in behalf of statewide candidates and have spent lib erally for advertising and lit erature. The Deinocrats pro duced a half‐hour documentary film shown extensively on tele vision both in the city and up state this week. The party raised $300,000 for the campaign at a dinner held in January. A committee headed by former Gov. W. Av erell Harriman distributed the money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unbought And Unbossed,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/01/archives/unbought-and-unbossed.html,"As the first black woman elected to Congress, Shirley Chisholm could have claimed headlines without ever saying a word. But the frail‐looking, 100 pound educator from Brooklyn's 12th Congressional District is proud that she has not been silent in the almost two years since she's been in Washington. She has consist ently spoken out against the things she believes wrong and stanchly supported the causes she believes to be in the best interest of her urban, mostly poor‐black constituents. In “Unbought and Unbossed,” she attempts to synthesize her political philosophy and pro vide the autobiographical back ground that will help us under stand a “fighting Shirley Chis holm.” The result is an interest ing profile of what some, in cluding Mrs. Chisholm, herself, have called, “the New Poli tician.” “Our representative democ racy is not working,” she writes, “because the Congress that is supposed to represent the voters does not respond to their needs. I believe the chief reason for this is that it is ruled by a small group of old men.” This is a passage typical of Shirley Chisholm's nettling candor, and it sets the stage for her first post‐election at tack ton the Congressional sys tem. She was accused of having committed political suicide when, upon receiving an assign ment to a committee she felt was irrelevant to her constituen cy, she demanded reassignment. In a desperation move to get off of the Rural Development and Forestry Subcommittee of the Agriculture Committee, she warned House Speaker John McCormack: “'If you do not assist me now, I will have to do my own thing.’ The Speak er was startled for the first time. ‘Your own what?’ she re called his asking.” Eventually her committee assignment was changed. Shirley Chisholm's book is not a literary masterpiece. In fact, sometimes it reads like a school primer; nevertheless it is important for its plain talk. Mrs. Chisholm is known as a fiery speaker, and her portrait is usually recorded by photogra phers during her most formida ble looking moments. There are consequently those who, as a result of her public image, are apprehensive about getting close enough to find out what she has to say even if they have missed it. Her book is a candid state ment of what she is all about. (Its title is derived from the fact that she has neither en couraged nor received support from the Democratic party reg ulars the “machine” as she calls it.) She begins by describ ing her childhood in Brooklyn, how she was shunted from her parents to her grandparents in Barbados and then back to hardtimes in Brooklyn during the thirties. She minces no words in her self assessment—even pointing out that because of her early exhibition of leadership quali ties, her father singled her out for special attention and gained her the lifelong enmity of other members of her family. Some times, however, her assessment lacks balance — particularly when she talks about others describing her speaking abili ties as “Messianic,” without smiling just a little bit about it. But her extreme soberness can easily be indulged, since she approaches everyone and every thing (including issues such as abortion reform, the abolition of the seniority system in Con gress, women's rights, the 18 year‐old vote and ending the Vietnam war) with the same earnestness. Shirley Chisholm realizes that under the present system, as a freshman member of Con gress, her powers to correct most of the ills she sees are limited. But she has set posi tive political goals for herself. One shortcoming of her book may be that she has not spelled out the practical means by which she will implement these goals, even though as a mem ber of Congress she has often supported legislation that di rectly benefited her constitu ency as well as the under privileged outside the 12th District. It is possible that her most significant contribution since her arrival in Washington is this book. She may not be able to do much about the problems she confronts, but, at least, un like the majority of her dis tinguished mostly‐white, male American colleagues, she does expose them. “Unbought and Unbossed” is a testament to her honesty and vigilance. ∎",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Science,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/01/archives/science-embryos-a-step-nearer-to-the-testtube-baby.html,"In 1818, Percy Bysshe Shel ley, his wife Mary and Lord Byron spent part of a wet summer in Switzerland. To while away the rainy days, Mary wrote a chilling tale about a Swiss scientist who learned how to invert life to a homemade man, formed of parts stolen from mortuaries and dissecting rooms. The resulting monster, ganged because all whom he met were revolted and fled, finally killed his maker (whose, name, of course was ??rankenstein) and vanished into an arctic Wilderness. Those seeking 16 produce human beings in the labora tory have had a bad name ever since. Producing an Embryo We know now that no one could ever perform Franken steirgs experiment, but it is possible to produce a human embryo in the laboratory by removing an almost mature egg cell from a woman and bringing it into contact with a drop of male semen. No babies have as yet been produced in this way, but at least one researcher is talk ing about doing so. The em bryo, after being cultured and allowed to subdivide “in vitro”—that is, in a glass vessel, such as a test tube— would be introduced into the womb of the woman from whom the egg was taken and allowed to reach maturity there. This tech nique has already produced living mice and other mam mals. The complete production of a “test tube baby” without any recourse to the sanctuary of the human womb is not yet in sight, although it may come eventually. However, the prospect of bringing into the world people who were con ceived in vitro has electri fied the scientific world with excitement—and a certain foreboding. The group that appears closest to such an effort, whose immediate goal is to enable certain sterile women to bear children, is led by Dr. Robert G. Edwards at Cambridge University in Eng land. A visit to his laboratory last week disclosed that em bryos fertilized in vitro are now being grown to the multi celled stage—well beyond the 16 cells described in a report in the Sept. 26 issue of the British journal Nature. First, he explained, the embryos now being cultured must be studied microscopi cally to make sure they are not subject to extensive ge netic defects. Certain of these defects, such as those lead ing to mongolism, can be recognized early in the life of an embryo by studying the chromosomes, or bundles of genetic material, that form during each cell division as the embryo grows. Two factors could contrb ute to such defects. One is damage to the egg cells dur ing laboratory handling. The other is the possibility that the egg is defective to be gin with. As women approach their forties, the chances of their producing a mongoloid child rise markedly and a number of those seeking treatment for sterility are in that age bracket Backlash Feared The foreboding of some specialists is rooted in their fear that the first baby con ceived in vitro and born to a hopeful mother will grimly call to mind Mary Shelley's nightmarish tale. Even if the baby was only mildly mal formed, the reaction of the public and of legislators called upon to vote funds for medical research could be catastrophic. There is a certain com petitiveness in current egg culturing efforts and, like Dr. Christiaan Barnard, the heart transplant pioneer, the first man to produce a baby in this way can expect instan taneous fame. Yet, if the resulting child is imperfect, the backlash will be fierce. In a period when science is already on the defensive, the effect, it is said, could range across all fields of research. For this reason, and to minimize possible contro versy, the National Institutes of Health are said to be un willing to support any experi ments directed toward the implantation in one woman of an egg derived from an other woman. The Cambridge University group says its goal is to implant in a prospective‐ mother only an egg cell taken from her own repro ductive system. The Technique This can be done where that system produces mature eggs, but where the ducts linking the ovary and the uterus, or womb, are blocked or absent. Roughly one‐quar ter of all sterile women are unable to bear children for lack of this linkage, whereby the egg cell descends when it reaches maturity. In the projected treatment the missing linkage is by passed by removing the egg, exposing it to sperm from the husband, and implanting the egg in the uterus when it has grown big enough to bur row into the uterine wall and establish a relationship with the mother's bloodstream. According to physicians caring for sterile women, many of the latter are eager to undergo such a procedure, even though it involves pene tration of the abdomen to ex tract the egg and a certain risk of genetic defects in the offspring. The risk can be re duced by extracting fluid from the sac enveloping the baby during pregnancy and culturing the cells adrift within it. This can show, for example, if the baby will be mongoloid, permitting artifi cial termination of the preg nancy. To those more concerned with preventing genetic de fects in babies born in the normal way, the chief sig nificance of in vitro culturing of human embryos is that it exposes to view the earliest stages of human develop ment—the splitting of the egg, first into two cells, then four, then eight, and so forth. It is suspected that a number of genetic defects originate in improper splitting of the chromosomes at such early stages. Many Questions A number of laboratories In ibis country, Britain and elsewhere are culturing human eggs, and it seems in evitable that sooner or later some will be implanted and that babies will result. The event will raise many ques tions: First, will it be considered proper, in vitro, to perform the most intimate, mysteri ous (and, to some, sacred) of all life processes: the cre ation of a new individual? If the resulting embryo begins to develop abnormally before implantation, will it be legal to destroy it? The issue, in that case, will be much like that raised by abortion. Fur thermore, who is to bear the responsibility if the resulting child is malformed, despite all precautions? And might an unscrupulous nation use the technique to mass pro duce people of a certain type? Wisdom Required As with other develop ments in science, such as the discovery of nuclear energy and the ability to control the human nervous system chem ically, this one will impose great demands on our wis dom and self‐control. The development of nuclear and nerve gas weapons does not augur well for the future. One can conjure up sci ence‐fiction visions of drone like warriors bred by some hostile nation. But one can also seek comfort in what seems a growing recognition that, while we cannot stif??e new knowledge, we can in sist that it, be used to build a better world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Environment,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/01/archives/environment-mercury-no-place-in-the-whole-world-is-safe.html,"WASHINGTON—A decade ago, an outpost of scientists in the Antarctic studying the physiology of penguins made a discovery that amazed them. Residues of DDT insecticide were found in the fatty tis sues of the birds, even though they lived thousands of miles from the nearest farm. The scientific world de voted little attention to the curious, discovery, though it should have for that innoc uous finding heralded the start of the age of the en vironment. The American people now are far more re sponsive to the seemingly endless man‐made insults to ecology. For example, last week a finding, similar to that in Antarctica triggered three separate. Federal investiga tions, with possibly more to come. This time, large amounts of mercury at levels considered toxic to humans were found in the livers of the Alaskan fur seals that live in the open Pacific Ocean scores of miles from land. As With the penguins and the DDT, the primary suspect in the mercury contamination is the concentration of indus trial pollution through the aquatic food chain; that is, the mercury is absorbed from the water by plankto'n and other small animals that are eaten by fish that in turn are eaten by the fur seals. A Federal marine biologist in Seattle, Dr. George Y. Harry, whose laboratory first discovered the mercury in the course of searching for DDT residues in the animals, called the finding “astound ing.” He noted that this species of seal lived in the open water 50 to 100 miles from polluted coastal areas, going ashore only in July to mate on the Pribilof Islands in the Bering Sea. “You can just figure from this that there isn't any place in the whole world that isn't contaminated,” commented Downing B. Randal, the owner of a specialty food business in Santa Rose, Calif., that used the ‘livers to make a “blood booster.” He said he had chosen seal liver, believ ing it had come “from an animal most free of con taminants.” The Federal Food and Drug Administration ordered the company to with draw from the market 10,000 iron supplement pills that the firm had made from the livers. They are considered to be only a moderate health hazard. Far more serious is the possible threat that con taminated fur seal meat poses to the native Aleuts in the Pribilofs to whom the food, especially pickled flip per knuckles, is a greast delicacy. Toxic amounts of mercury can cause brain damage, mental retardation and spontaneous abortions. The United States Public Health Service fleW a team of doctors to the Pribilofs to examine the residents. Pre liminary studies have shown a high level of mercury in the hair of some of the is landers. The Indian Health Service now is trying to find out what effect the mercury has had on the residents over the years. On the mainland, toxic levels of mercury have been detected in fish and wild birds in at least 33 states and Canada. In the last year, mercury pollution, which had been almost unknown until recently, has been discovered in massive amounts in some parts of Lake Erie, San Fran cisco Bay, Lake Calcasieu in Louisiana, the Delaware Riv er, Brunswick Bay, Ga., Lake Champlain, the Tennessee River and many other places. Government agencies have ordered the suspension of commercial fishing in some parts of California, Louisiana, Michigan and Ontario be cause of mercury pollution. Mercury, which stems from pulp mills, paper ‐ processing plants and other chemical facilities, suddenly has been found to be endemic: in the open ocean, coastal water, rivers and inland lakes. The mercury, problem has got so out of hand that public health officers in some states have warned sports fisher men, not to eat their catches of trout, bass, catfish and crab. Toxic mercury levels have also been found in game birds like pheasants in North Dakota and California. The birds eat farm seeds that have been coated with mer cury to ward off insects. Dr. Ephraim Kahn, a Cali fornia public health official who heads a Federal‐state mercury investigating team, warned on Wednesday that some striped bass and cat fish in San Francisco Bay were so heavily contaminated with mercury that they should be eaten only once week, and not by pregnant women at all. “Mercury has an affinity for the fetus and is much more toxic in unborn children than adults,” he said. Dr. Kahn cited studies made in Japan that showed mer cury intoxication in pregnant women had caused their chil dren to be afflicted with mental retardation and cere bral palsy. “The levels of mercury in the species of fish that we tested are probably no higher than they were 20 years ago,” Dr. Kahn said, adding: “But we are making this important warning because we know lot more about mercury now than we did then.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Seven Key Races in the Battle for Control of the Senate..,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/01/archives/seven-key-races-in-the-battle-for-control-of-the-senate-california.html,"The ideological balance of the Senate will be determined in the election this Tuesday. What follows are descriptions of seven key contests in that battle. The roundups are based on material provided by New York Times cor respondents R. W. Apple Jr., Steven V. Rob erts and Warren Weaver Jr. The California Senate race drew to a tense and emotional close this weekend as Represen tative John V. Tunney, the Democratic chal lenger, struggled to hold a lead over the in cumbent, Senator George Murphy. The latest California Poll, conducted by Mervin Field, showed the 36‐year‐old Congressman opening a seven‐point margin over the 68‐year‐old Sen ator. But the Democrats were still worried. President Nixon led a last‐minute drive to salvage Senator Murphy with speeches, at San Jose on Thursday and Anaheim on Friday. When he was met by angry, rock‐throwing demonstrators, it gave the Senator a chance to denounce the “lawlessness” that is such a volatile issue in California, which leads the nation in bank burnings. The spring of tension was wound tighter on Friday when Gov. Ronald Reagan called up National Guardmen to protect candidates against the threat of radical action—a move the Democrats immediately labeled “political grand standing.” The week's events provided a fitting climax to a campaign so vituperative that the epithet “God damn liar!” was practically a compliment. Mr. Tunney's most powerful issue was the disclosure that Senator Murphy had accepted $20,000 a year and other benefits as a consultant to the Technicolor Corporation. The revelations were particularly damaging to a man like Senator Murphy, whose main politi cal credential has always been a sort of cheer ful straightforwardness—the “good old Murph” image. Mr. Murphy also suffered from the fact that an operation for throat cancer had left his voice weak and raspy. This aura of sickliness contrasted sharply with Mr. Tunney's image of rampant good health and vitality—an image fostered by TV commercials showing him run ning along the beach in a conscious imitation of the Kennedy style. Mr. Tunney, however, was on the receiving end of charges that he lacked substance and depth. One popular line branded him “the light weight son of a heavyweight champ,” a refer ence to his father, Gene Tunney, the undefeated prizefighter. Senator Murphy's major advantage is the pulling power of Governor Reagan, who is expected to defeat Jess Unruh by close to a million votes. The election will probably be decided on how tightly. Mr. Murphy can cling to the Governor's coattail. The race for the Senate in Connecticut this year is full of complexities: An incumbent, tainted by scandal and censured by his col leagues, who is seeking re‐election as an Inde pendent; a Democratic candidate who embodies much of what is meant by “the new politics”: a Republican challenger who .is less conserva tive than the national Administration, and swirl of ethnic factors. Senator Thomas J. Dodd, white‐haired, 63 years old, a liberal .on some issues but a con servative on crime and a hawk on the Vietnam war, is given little chance of winning. His role is that of .the spoiler whose votes will deter mine who will actually triumph. The Rav Joseph Duffey, the Democrat and national chairman of Americans for Democratic Action, has been a bitter opponent of the war and the champion of liberal domestic causes. Also, he has appealed successfully to many union members on more‐traditional economic grounds, and he won a striking primary victory by assembling a coalition of workers, stu dents and antiwar suburbanites. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., the Republican, has tried to station himself in the middle, opposing President Nixon on some issues and backing him on others. In New Haven last week, the three candi dates met in their only scheduled debate of the campaign. Senator Dodd declared that he “wouldn't be here today if I was ashamed of anything I've ever done,” adding that he was “proud to be the only member of the Senate proven to be honest by ordeal.” The 39‐year old Mr. Duffey charged that his position had been distorted by Mr. Weicker, who, on the problems of the economy, suggested that the blame rested with the state government. Mr. Duffey, however, said it was Washington's fault. Mr. Duffey is a Protestant minister; a fact that displeases many of the state's traditionally Democratic Catholics. Irish‐Americans, denied a major place on the Democratic ticket for the first time in decades, may vote for Mr. Dodd or the 30‐year‐old Mr. Weicker. So may some Italian‐Americans, who have not been moved by the lackluster campaign of Emilio Q. Dad dario, the Democratic nominee for Governor. Mr. Duffey has been one of the principal tar gets of Vice President. Agnew, who has repeatedly called him a Marxist. According to Mr. Duffey, the. Vice President lifted out of context a remark made by Mr. Duffey to the authors of a book on the 1968 campaign. However, Mr. Duffey has an unusually effi cient organization, and it is expected to mount a skillful Election Day operation to get every Duffey voter to the polls. If Democratic defec tions to Mr. Dodd are less serious than antici pated, superior organization could pull Mr. Duffey through. And if he wins, his victory would be the most important of the year for the issues‐oriented, antiwar style of “new poli tics” introduced two years ago in the Presiden tial campaign of Senator Eugene J. McCarthy. With all its variety, the 1970 election prob ably has not produced a contest in which the candidates are farther apart, and the result likely to be closer, than the bare‐knuckle Indiana struggle between Senator Vance K. Hartke, Democrat, and Representative Richard L. Roudebush, Republican. Six months ago, Senator Hartke, one of the Nixon Administration's prime targets, was re garded in G.O.P. circles as the Democrat most likely to recede. He was both a liberal, on domestic policy and a dove on Vietnam, neither exactly a majority view among stubborn, sus picious, conservative Hoosiers. He had been accused of accepting an illegal payment from a Chicago‐mail‐order house deeply interested in Federal legislation, and his state party was badly split. But Senator Hartke has now pulled up to within hailing distance of Mr. Roudebush (his name rhymes with HOW‐da‐bush)—so close, in fact, that most Indiana politicians are hesitant to predict the outcome. And so close, too, that both President Nixon and Vice President Agnew have made major appearances in the state, try ing to insure the Republican pick‐up that once seemed ho certain. Representative Roudebush, a former national commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, has moved to the left somewhat to approach the Nixon foreign policy—but only somewhat. He dropped his call for a military victory in Vietnam in favor of the President's phased withdrawal, but only a few weeks ago he was attacking Mr. Nixon for visiting President Tito in Yugoslavia. It has been one of the dirtier campaigns of an unclean year. A Roudebush television com mercial, later withdrawn, suggested that Senator Hartke was giving arms to the Vietcong when he voted for an international trade bill. Democratic leaders have publicly tried to capitalize on hints that the Congressman has been mar ried more than the two times he acknowledges. Indiana has become something of a matter of pride for the Administration. The state gave the President his largest majority of 1968, and the White House personally pressed for the nomination of Mr. Roudebush over a candidate preferred by the Republican Governor, Edgar Whitcomb. Besides Vietnam and a bitter series of left right accusations, the economy has become a major issue in Indiana, where the automobile strike has lifted unemployment to a level that almost inescapably helps the Hartke cause. “It's more than a coincidence that every time you have a G.O.P. Administration, you have a recession, high interest rates and tight money,” the Senator observed recently. The critical question seems to be: Can the economic problems be counterbalanced by this appeal at the end of each Republican television commercial: “Roudebush thinks the way you do.” Win or lose in a close one, the image makers may be right about Indiana. When President Nixon visited North Dakota last month, he told a crowd at the Grand Forks International Airport that an important amend ment, guaranteeing parity price supports for wheat, had been inserted in the farm bill, and “the man who recommended it, the man who came down to the White House and talked to me about it, the man who got it in the farm bill is Tom Kleppe.” Representative: Thomas Kleppe, making his second try at Senator Quentin Burdick's Demo cratic seat, may have winced slightly at that The compromise farm bill, still pending in Congress, remains highly unpopular among North Dakota farmers, ‘even with its new wheat provision, and the Republican candidate has been trying to dodge any identification with it. In a state like North Dakota, one of the nation's largest feed‐grain producers, a Senator can rise or fall on his farm policy. Tuesday's vote will also test the efficacy of a high‐powered, im ported and provocative political advertising campaign on a straight‐forward state not accustomed to such goings‐on. Republican ads have accused Senator Burdick, an authentic back‐country type, of fostering “permissive ness” and suggest that his votes as a liberal favor violence and crime. An ad in the Bis marck Tribune, for example, jays: “Do you want stronger bombing laws: eighty‐four per cent of North Dakota says ‘yes,’ Quentin Bur dick says ‘no.’” Mr. Kleppe said that he believed the ads were “pointed,” but added that awakening voters to the campaign was like the situation with a mule. “The way to get his attention,” he said, “is to hit him on the head with two‐by‐four.” In a state in which a half‐minute television spot during the Thursday night movie in the largest city cost $32.50, Representative Kleppe originally budgeted an awesome $300,000 for his campaign, then cut back when local resent ment became apparent and Senator Burdick began scoring sympathy points. The polls have consistently shown Senator Burdick ahead, but his margin has never been large and it has dwindled perceptibly as elec tion day neared. Straw poll in the wind: Sarles, North Dakota, which has not voted for a loser in any Senate, House or Governorship race since 1956, held a newspaper poll a week ago, and Senator Burdick won, 43 to 16. Howard M. Metzenbaum's campaign buttons say, “I'm a Metz Fan,” and the analogy is apt. Mr. Metzenbaum, a 53‐year‐old lawyer‐busi nessman‐millionaire from Cleveland, lives in a baronial home behind a pond that local wags call “Lake Metzenbaum.” He was a political unknown when the year began, but he man aged to win the Democratic nomination for Senator from Ohio by defeating John H. Glenn, one of the pioneer astronauts. In the general election, Mr. Metzenbaum is opposed by Robert Taft Jr. for the seat now held by Senator Stephen M. Young, who is retiring. Mr. Taft, 53, son of a Presidential candidate and grandson of a President, is also a millionaire, though rather less flamboyantly so than Mr. Metzenbaum. He is from Cincinnati. Mr. Taft would be a heavy favorite were it not for the loan scandal that has engulfed the Republican state ticket. He has not repudiated his running mates, but has emphasized his own integrity and tried in other ways to keep his distance from them. Whether he wins or not will depend in part on the showing of John J. Gilligan, the Demo cratic candidate for Governor. Mr. Gilligan is universally expected to triumph, but he will have to win by a very large margin, in the opinion of Ohio experts, to pull Mr. Metzen baurn in with him. Once before, in 1964, Mr. Taft was on the verga of election to the Senate, only to be beaten when a running mate was crushingly defeated. In that election, Senator Barry Gold water was swamped in Ohio by Lyndon B. Johnson. Mr. Metzenbaum's campaign in the general election has been less outspokenly liberal than his Campaign in the primary. For example, in a debate last week, he expressed opposition to New York's abortion law and to busing as a means of school integration. Mr. ??aft, who has a reputation as a mod erate described Mr. Metzenbaum's performance as “a hoax” and a misrepresentation of the way he would vote later. He pictured him as “an ultra‐liberal of the McGovern‐Kennedy line.” Mr. Metzenbaum's main theme—one he has in common with Democrats across the country —has been the economy. He chided the Ad ministration for “purposely creating unemploy ment” and for dragging its feet in withdrawing from Indochina, arguing that Mr. Taft is an apologist for the President on these issues. When the two candidates for the Senate in Tennessee met the other night in Chattanooga. the contrast could not have been greater. Ten ressee's is one 1970 race where no one could mistake the candidates for Tweedle‐dum and Tweedle‐dee. Albert Gore, the Democratic candidate, is 62 years old, with 32 years on Capitol Hill. Hand some, white‐haired, an orator in the old bell ringing Southern style, he has about him an air of melodrama. He likes to call himself the Gray Fox. Because of his liberalism, Senator Gore has been a major target of the Nixon Administra tion, and both the President and Vice President Agnew have campaigned in Tennessee. Mr. Nixon, on his campaign visit, said, “The Presi dent that Tennessee voted for [in 1968] should have a man in the United States Senate who votes with him and not against him on the big issues.” Mr. Gore has not retreated a step from his liberal positions—opposition to the war, opposi tion to the ABM, support for most Federal civil rights legislation— that are unpopular among many Tennesseans. But his stress Is on the economic issues that have provided his long‐standing populist base. At Chattanooga the Senator asked his oppo nent, Representative William E. Brcick, to “tell the people why he voted against the anti poverty program, why he voted 13 times against Federal aid to education, why he voted against the Appalachia bill.” Mr. Brock, 40, is no stem winder. A candy manufacturer before he entered politics, he looks and talks and acts like, a member of the Junior Chamber of Commerce. He is a con servative. His issues are those that can be expected against a liberal Senator in a conservative state —busing, gun control, school prayer and Mr. Gore's votes against President Nixon's nomi nees for the Supreme Court. In the final hours of the campaign, Mr. Brock found a convenient handle for his attacks on “the Supreme Court that puts handcuffs on the police” and “the permissive universities that are breeding revolutionaries.” Within hours after the attack on Mr. Nixon in San Jose, Calif., Thursday, Mr. Brock was citing it as evidence of “outrageous violence.” Polls taken for both parties indicate that Mr. Brock is ahead, although Mr. Gore seems to have closed the gap a bit. Unless Mr. Gore can collect the votes of majority of those who backed George C. Wal lace for President in 1968‐34 per cent of the electorate—he will have little chance. Indica tions on the final weekend of the campaign were that many of the Democrats who backed George Wallace were leaning to Mr. Brock. The defeat of Mr. Gore would be a victory for the Administration's Southern strategy in contest that has attracted more national at tention than any other, and a warning to other liberals not to stray too far to the left of their const t????ncies. When President Nixon flew to Salt Lake City yesterday, the trail was well broken before him. Earlier Administration visitors have included Vice President Agnew, Secretary of the Treas ury David Kennedy, Secretary of Housing and Urban. Development George Romney, White House counselor Robert Finch and Tricia Nixon. “Well,” observed a Democratic Congressional candidate, “at least this election is good for Utah's tourist trade.” The investment the Republicans have been willing to make in the defeat of Senator Frank (Ted) Moss and the election of Representative Lawrence J. Burton signifies how important the party believes it is to recapture what should be, by any normal political definition, its kind of Senate seat. Utah's other Senator and both House mem bers are Republicans who won with solid majorities. The state gave Richard Nixon 76.5 per cent of its vote in 1968. Its heavily Mormon population is, almost by fiat, conservative enough to be unsettled by the fact that Ameri cans for Democratic Action gives Senator Moss a 70 liberal voting rating. Senator Moss is a typical member of the Democratic class of 1958, which is made up of Senators who won upset victories that year, were carried to re‐election by the Johnson landslide of 1964 and who now are vulnerable. Both candidates are Mormons (as are visiting Secretaries Kennedy and Romney), and the influence of the church runs through the c??mpaign Senator Moss, who has been the beneficiary of financial help from labor, opposes Utah's right‐to‐work law; the church and Rep resentative Burton support it. In this special culture in which liquor and tobacco are officially forbidden, the Senator has stressed his campaign against cigarette advertising on television, and the Congressman has been forced to squelch rumors that he drinks. Representative Burton, whose district is the relatively rural eastern two‐thirds of the state, has been working to shake 50,000 hands in the last month, mostly in the Salt Lake area.. Utah, with a total vote under 400.000, is the kind of state where candidates can win that way. In a race as close as this one now appears, the decisive factor could be the American Inde pendent Party candidate, Clyde B. Freeman, whose vote can only weaken the Republican cause.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
News Summary and Index,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/02/archives/news-summary-and-index-the-major-events-of-the-day-the-election.html,"MONDAY, NOVEMBER 2, 1970 Governor Rockefeller, Arthur J. Goldberg and Dr. Paul L. Adams met yesterday for their final television debates of the New York gubernatorial campaign. Mr. Rockefel ler and Mr. Goldberg, his Democratic‐Liberal opponent, disagreed sharply on the state's abortion law, commuter taxes and the cam paign activities of President Nixon and Vice President Agnew. [Page 1, Column 8.] The three Senatorial candidates from New York grew sharp in their rebuttals of one another's charges in their final television debate, showing their wear at the end of a long and sometimes bitter campaign. The three are Senator Charles E. Goo??ell, the Republican‐Liberal incumbent, Richard L. Ottinger, the Democrat, and James L. Buck ley, the Conservative. [1:6–7.] A survey found a probable Republican gain in the next Senate of one to three seats. The Republicans, who need seven seats to gain control of the Senate, have outspent the Democrats 5 to 1 in this year's cam paign and have sent the President and the Vice President on the stump. [1:6–7.] Mr. Nixon conferred in San Clemente, Calif., with Mr. Agnew, then issued a state ment directing the Justice Department to aid state and local police forces in cases involv ing attacks on policemen. Mr. Agnew later accused the Democrats of “fear and scare tactics” in, implying that the economy had deteriorated under Mr. Nixon. [56:7–8.] The demonstrators in a crowd that threw eggs and stones at President Nixon last Thursday in San Jose, Calif., said Mr. Nixon had exaggerated the incident for his own political advantage. “He's trying to put fear into people; he's trying to drive them to the right,” one young man said. [56:7–8.] Vladimir S. Semyonov, the head of the Soviet delegation to the new round of Soviet‐American talks on arms limitation, arrived in Helsinki and said his side was “awaiting with interest” the beginning today of the third round of the talks. Later, Soviet sources stressed the need for the talks to remain free of polemics. [1:1.] The most serious potential rival to Presi dent Nguyen Van Thieu of South Vietnam broke a year‐long political silence with a speech calling for “national reconciliation” and implying that he was the man who could achieve it. Maj. Gen. Duong Van Minh, a popular figure throughout South Vietnam, declared that his country was becoming more destitute and its people more miser able. Mr. Thieu's term ends next year. [1:3.] All the emergency exits in a dance hall near Saint‐Laurent‐du‐Pont, France, were padlocked and nailed shut with planks to keep out people without tickets as an early morning fire began among the 165 dancers. Rescue workers found 142 people dead, with the bodies of many piled near the doors. Eight persons were hospitalized. [1:2.] An airline catering van swerved into a diplomatic reception line at Karachi Interna tional Airport, killing a Polish Deputy For eign Minister, Zygfrygd Wolniak, and three Pakistanis and injuring several Polish offi cials. The Polish President, Marshal Marian Spychalski, who was being welcomed at the airport, was unhurt but cut short his visit to Pakistan. The van driver was held. [1:4.] Professor Jaime Benitez, president of the University of Puerto Rico, urged that young Puerto Ricans who favor total independence for their island be granted conscientious ob jector status in the draft. He said that the approximately 1,000 men who would be af fected believed deeply that service in Amer ican forces violated their conscience. [18:1.] Enrollments in the nation's medical schools have risen sharply and include sig nificantly more minority students despite the severe financial plight of many of the schools, the Association of American Medi cal Colleges reported. The association is ask ing for Federal aid to enroll even more students toward the goal of 175 doctors per 100,000 population, the third highest ratio in the world, after Russia and Israel. [27:1.] Budget Director Edward E. Hamilton said that city spending in the next budget could be $100‐million more than previously esti mated. That, along with an expected drop in anticipated revenues, could lead to a def icit of up to $300‐million, he said. [1:5.] Negotiators for the Newspaper Guild and for The Daily News and The New York Times worked against a strike deadline of 6 A.M. today to settle contract differences. The guild had said that one of the papers would be struck if no settlement was reached but had not said which one.

"GOVERNOR, RIVALS ARGUE ON CHANGE IN ABORTION LAW",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/02/archives/governor-rivals-argue-on-change-in-abortion-law-sharp-dispute-on.html,"Governor Rockefeller and Ar thur J. Goldberg, debating for the last times in the guberna torial campaign, sharply dis agreed yesterday on the need for changes in the state's abor tion law: a possible commuter tax increase and the campaign tactics of President Nixon and Vice President Agnew. However, both agreed on the effect of the election of the other. “A disaster,” said Mr. Rockefeller of a Goldberg elec tion. “A major disaster,” said Mr. Goldberg of a Rockefeller re‐election for a fourth term. While many voters spent a sunny and mild Sunday out doors or watching televised professional football, the two gubernatorial candidates and their Conservative opponent, Paul L. Adams, spent a good part of the afternoon in televi sion studios for their hour‐long debates on WNBC‐TV and WCBS‐TV. On the abortion issue Mr. Goldberg warned against chang ing the law while Mr. Rocke feller said some amendments would be needed, and Dr. Adams called for repeal of the liberal ized law. Six Million to Vote The eight‐month‐long cam paign will end tomorrow when more than six million New Yorkers are expected to vote between 6 A.M. and 9 P.M. to choose a Governor, United States Senator, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, State Controller, Representa tives, State Senators, Assembly men and local officials and judges. Despite occasional flashers of anger during the two debates, the gubernatorial candidates, in their last scheduled meeting of the campaign, were friendly to ward each other at the end. However, the final debate was spiced by the surprise ap pearance of Democratic State Chairman John J. Burns in the studio immediately after the televised encounter. Confronting the Governor, Mr. Burns said that Mr. Rocke feller had “maligned” him by asserting that Mr. Burns was one of those who had, offered the chairmanship of the Metro politan Transportation Authority to former City Controller Mario A. Procaccino in return for an endorsement of Mr. Gold berg. Quivering with anger, Mr. Burns told Mr. Rockefeller that he was “shocked that you re sorted to something like this.” The Governor, visibly upset, re sponded that Mr. Burns should discuss the matter with Mr. Procaccino. “I just finished de bating Mr. Goldberg and I'm not debating you,” said Mr. Rocke feller before he walked out with a group of aides. On camera, the sharpest dif ferences arose over the abor tion and commuter tax issues and the Nixon‐Agnew tactics. Mr. Goldberg said flatly that it was too early to change the state's new abortion law and that in any event he would “stick by the law unless there ,is proof it is not working.” Mr. Rockefeller said that there ,were unspecified “prob lems” with the law and pre dicted that “there will be amendments as needed to pro tect individuals :and health standards.” Dr. Adams favored a return. to the original law, which permitted abortions only to save the pregnant woman's life. On a possible increase in the income tax that New York City collects from commuters, Mr. Goldberg said he would not favor such a move. The city would need Albany's approval to raise the tax. Mr. Rockefeller did not re spond to the question in the debate and said later in re sponse to a reporter's question that any commuter tax increase could only be “considered as part of a total program.” Reminded that Mr. Goldberg had pledged no commuter tax increase the Govornor naused and said that “the whole ques tion of budget has to be con sidered as a total package, not from a single part.” Mr. Goldberg said that he re gretted the “character” and the “level” of the Nixon‐Agnew emphasis on law and order and permissiveness as campaign is sues. The Governor said that on these two points, the President and Vice President were “ex pressing a feeling shared by many.” Dr. Adams agreed that Nixon‐Agnew statements were “quite in order.” Another bone of contention arose when Mr. Rockefeller pointedly declined to attack James L. Buckley, the Conser vative candidate for Senator, despite the baiting of Mr. Gold berg. The Democratic candidate charged that Mr. Buckley was “a reactionary” who “would take us back to the Hoover days.” He called on the Governor “to repudiate that kind of phi losophy.” Mr. Rockefeller de dined: “I happen to believe in a positive campaign; I'm for Mr. Goodell,” the Governor said referring to Senator Charles E. Goodell, the Republican‐Liberal Senate candidate. Mr. Goldberg, although some what less combative than he had been in, their first televised debate Wednesday evening, fre quently taxed the Governor yes terday with the argument that Mr. Rockefeller has been in of fice 12 years but had not solved many state problems. “Why does the Governor keep talking like he's running for the first time,” said Mr. Goldberg at one point. “Where has he been for the last 12 years?” Mr. Rockefeller ignored the needles until the closing mo ments of the second debate when he said that 90 per cent of the state's newspapers had endorsed him. “We must be do ing something right,” the Gov ernor said. The two candidates also dis agreed on the role of State Controller Arthur Levitt in the budget‐making process. Mr. Goldberg said that the Con troller should participate in the formulation of the budget, while the Governor said that Mr. Levitt was essentially an auditor who reviewed state spending after the budget took effect. Both declined to pledge no tax increases during the next administration. Mr. Goldberg said that he hoped to raise revenue by closing unspecified tax loopholes. Mr. Rockefeller expressed doubt that such move would raise substantial revenue and added that it was too early to tell the state of the budget next year. The gubernatorial candidates limited their appearances yes terday to the debates. Both Mr. Goldberg and the Governor are scheduled to wind up their campaigns today with quick flying trips around the state.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Scurrilous Campaign Tactics,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/02/archives/scurrilous-campaign-tactics.html,"At both the national and state level, this campaign has been disfigured by deceitful advertising and ruthless dis tortion. President Nixon has set a bad example by his effort to link the Democrats with “thugs and hoodlums.” Now Carl L. Shipley, Republican National Committee man for the District of Columbia, has placed vicious advertisements in 61 newspapers around the country attacking five Democratic Senators and one Democratic senatorial candidate. These advertisements are so scur rilous that six newspapers, including The Washington Evening Star, refused to run them. The three‐quarter‐page advertisements assert that these Democrats believe in “excusing crime, undermining national defense, forgiving rioters and looters, and ac cepting the use of marijuana and heroin by our young people.” In support of this fantastic indictment, the advertise ments cite a dozen quotations from leading Democrats. Some of these quotations are fragments torn out of sen tences, and several others have an entirely different import when read in their original context. Two co‐signers of these advertisements have disavowed Mr. Shipley's use of their names. He has denied that his paper organization, “Committee for a Responsible Con gress,” has any connection with the Republican National Committee. But his advertisements are sadly consistent with the theme and tone of the Republican national cam paign as directed by that committee and by the White House. It is up to the voters to rebuke this whole shabby business at the polls tomorrow. In the New York campaign, members of the State Legislature who had the courage and decency to vote for reform of the antiquated abortion law are being sub jected now to scurrilous political attack far exceeding any bounds of fair campaign comment. For example, opponents of Assemblyman Leonard Price Stavisky (Dem.‐Lib.) in the 23d District of Queens, and Eli Wager (Dem.‐Lib.) in Nassau's Fifteenth District, have accused them of being “Hitlerites” and “murderers.” These tactics, too, cry out for repudiation at the polls.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/02/archives/letters-to-the-editor.html,"• To Improve Courts To the Editor: It is encouraging that the court improvement proposals of Governor Rockefeller, Chief Judge Fuld and Mayor Lindsay have all received wide public attention through The Times and other media. The New York State Bar Associa tion has been working intensively along many of the lines suggested. Partly through its efforts and under the legislative leadership of Senator Hughes and Assemblyman Crawford, first passage was obtained in 1969 of a proposed constitutional amend ment to permit transfer out of the criminal courts to administrative bodies of large numbers of offenses such as minor traffic violations, health and building code violations, and sumptuary offenses (prostitution, alcoholism and ??ddiction). The Times and other media should put their shoulders to the wheel to obtain the required second passage at the new session of the Legislature. While the association's proposal for automobile accident insurance cover age (the Hughes‐Crawford bill) in cludes immediate payment up to $1,500 and other very important benefits, it also would be a source of considerable relief to the over taxed civil courts. The “no‐fault” pro posals of Superintendent Richard E. Stewart along these lines would not be fair to those who suffer such seri ous injuries as permanent dismember ment, disfigurement and pain, and, in the judgment of former Chief Judge Desmond, would increase, not de crease, court congestion. The Hughes ‐ Crawford bill is of great public importance. It should at tract statewide support from most of the bar, as well as from others, and deserves the help of the press. More funds and more buildings are definitely needed to cope with con gestion in both civil and criminal courts, particularly in New York. City, but it is also important that the funds and buildings be properly administered. A unified state judicial budget should be adopted so that court funds will be administered on an efficient statewide basis. Courthouses also should be under central administra tion. The State Bar seeks support for a statewide courthouse authority. While the tide is running, let us hope that the Legislature may adopt some of these long‐overdue reforms. To achieve this the continuing support and under standing of the media and the public is required. • Run‐Off in Senate Race To the Editor: The present electoral system will clearly allow for the representation of a militant minority in the U.S. Senate, if present trends continue. Would not New York State be better served if the participants agreed to a run‐off election one week following the general election, so the majority of our citizens could be represented? The new electoral situation of three major parties, if allowed to continue without some structural change, threat ens to undermine the entire basis of a society in which government is re sponsive to the will of the people. • Election Day Holiday To the Editor: Many people will go to the polls on Nov. 3—Election Day—but many oth ers will not exercise their privilege, will not cast a single vote. Why? Apathy is a serious problem; it is often responsible for the election of mediocre candidates. Voting costs nothing and is a right we should take advantage of on Nov. 3. If Election Day were declared a legal holiday, and we didn't have to rush off to work, many more people would go to the polls unhurriedly, and have time to ponder over the candidates and issues. For Goodell's Withdrawal To the Editor: The Senate race in New York State has been sordid and nasty. Along with other sober‐minded citizens I have been sickened by the spectacle of President Nixon's hatchet man, Spiro Agnew, carrying out the decreed political exe cution of Senator Charles Goodell. The episode is uncomfortably reminiscent of a gang lord arranging the execution of a vassal who has slipped from favor. I am deeply in sympathy with those of Senator Goodell's supporters whose resolve has been stiffened by this dis graceful conduct in the nation's highest offices. But I believe they must face the fact that their loyalty can only help to make the Nixon‐Agnew plot succeed. The strategy is to divide and con quer. If enough voters stay with Sen ator Goodell, James Buckley will be elected Senator. And. Mr. Nixon will obtain at the same time the conserv ative he wants in the Senate and the ruination of the man who dared to oppose him. Senator Goodell, despite his last ditch fight, is clearly a casualty. I urge his adherents to vote for Richard L. Ottinger and frustrate one part at least of this two‐pronged plot. I believe that Mr. Ottinger will serve in the Senate not only as an able cus todian of the peoples’ interests, but also as a reminder to the Adminis tration that the executioner's axe may have another edge. • Bella Abzug's Stand To the Editor: Seymour Siegel perpetuated a cal umny of Bella S. Abzug, Democratic Congressional candidate, when he quoted [letter Oct. 30] an article in Commentary magazine which had Mrs. Abzug telling Paul O'Dwyer that she did not favor sanctuary in the U.S. for non‐Communist Vietnamese and that such people deserve the punishment that awaits them. Both Paul O'Dwyer and Mrs. Abzug have informed Commentary that the article is a complete falsehood. Mrs. Abzug has become the target of more lies and distortions of her outstandingly liberal, record than I can recall happening to any other candi date in my experience. In this case?? Mr. Siegel's description of Mrs. Abzug's opponent as a liberal is also deceptive in that he neglects to mention that Barry Farber is running on the Republican ticket. • Rosenfeld in 44th A.D. To the Editor: Your preference for the Democratic candidate in the 44th Assembly Dis trict, Kings County [editorial Oct. 28], appears to be based upon the fact that he should be elected solely because he prevailed in the primary elections. I am the Liberal party candidate for Assembly in the 44th Assembly Dis trict. At no time have I been inter viewed by anyone in any way con nected with The Times. It is hard to believe that a newspa per of your stature and recognition can endorse a candidate when it has no knowledge of those involved. I urge the voters in my district to vote Column D from the bottom up for me. • Carlin in 44th A.D. To the Editor. I feel that it is unfortunate that you did not recommend Fredric M. Carlin, Republican, in Brooklyn's Forty‐fourth Assembly District. Mr. Carlin has worked as director of research and program planning for Commissioner of Consumer Affairs Bess Meyerson Grant. He is currently serving in an advisory capacity on consumer matters to Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz. But, more important, Fredric Carlin is one of a new breed of Republicans— young, aggressive and involved. • For Assemblyman Burrows To the Editor: It is a great disappointment to find The Times endorsing the Democrat Liberal party opponent of Assembly man Gordon W. Burrows (Ninetieth District). Gordon Burrows was the sponsor with Al Blumenthal of the original abortion law and the sponsor of Gov ernor Rockefeller's program bill on the abortion law. He was the only Repub lican Assemblyman in New York State who voted against cutting aid to edu cation. He is ranking Westchester member, and second ranking member of the Education Committee. Gordon Burrows voted against the antibusing bill. He introduced a unit pricing law for New York State, spon sored gun control and conservation legislation. • Senator Gordon Supported To the Editor: The Times has displayed a lack of objectivity and fairness in its insist ence that to vote for State Senator Bernard Gordon is to defeat insurance reform. Senator Gordon pushed through leg islation creating the Fire Pool for those who cannot obtain fire insurance. He has been instrumental in the passing of a new law which strengthens the hand of the State Insurance Depart ment in dealing with companies who use sharp claims practices. The Senator introduced a bill, subsequently en acted, which limits the rights of insur ance companies to cancel or to refuse to renew automobile insurance poli cies. He did the same with fire insur ance and homeowner policies. Since The Times is aware of Sena tor Gordon's accomplishments, I can only assume that criticism of the Sen ator must he based upon, his attitude toward no‐fault automobile insurance. Senator Gordon has assembled a staff of experts to advise him and the other members of the Joint Legislative Com mittee on Insurance Rates and Regu lation on the viability of the plan. This prudent action is deserving of praise, not editorial condemnation. Chemical Warfare as ‘Humane’ Warfare To the Editor: Gen. J. H. Rothschild no doubt caused some dismay among Times readers recently with his modest pro posal, “The Myth of ‘Humane’ Weap ons” [Op. Ed. column Oct. 13]. For he argued that chemical agents are more controllable, that they cause fewer deaths, and hence are more humane. However, researchers like Meselson, Pfeiffer, Orians, Neilands, Mayer and Galston have shown conclusively that the uncontrollable side‐effects of chem ical herbicides in Indochina have caused many deaths of women and children by starvation, have damaged the soil for an indefinite duration and have caused birth defects. Our lack of control is also shown by the fact that we have dumped 13.5 million gallons of chemicals on South Vietnam alone, on 12 per cent of its total acreage. And the inhumanity of our crop‐destruction program becomes quite clear when we discover that the Vietcong themselves survive (the army always eats first), whereas children and lactating women die. Equally repellent is the manner in which we actually use ‘tear gas. We flush out both combatants and civil ians—men, women and children—from their bomb‐shelters, and then subject them to barrages of gunfire, bombings and artillery. The danger inherent in chemical agents of warfare is thus the same as the danger inherent in all techno logical weapons—“the erosion of re straint.” For example, citing the Penta gon's own figures, Edward S. Herman reveals in his recent book, “Atrocities in Vietnam,” that the U.S. has used almost 10 million tons of ordnance, over 450 times more than the enemy. By 1969, we had left 3.5 million B‐52 craters on South Vietnam's terrain. The bombings, the shellings, the de foliation, the napalm, the massacres have produced at least one million casualties, of whom at least 300,000 have died, according to the Senate subcommittee on refugees. Meanwhile, 3.5 million South Vietnamese, victims of our bombings, have become refu gees. This erosion of our restraint in war making has meant extensive violations of The Hague and Geneva Conven tions, to which we are signatories, and of the Nuremberg Principles, which we helped formulate. For in stance, Geneva 3.1 (1949) makes the murder or mistreatment of civilians, by whatever means (e.g., indiscriminate bombings, deliberate starvation), a war crime. Hague N. 23‐e bans weapons (like napalm and fragmentation bombs) that “cause unnecessary suffering.” These attempts to make war more humane have failed in Indochina, but only because one nation—despite its obsession with law and order at home —has misused its unchallengable pow er to flout law and order on the inter national plane. Instead of inviting fur ther erosions and violations, as Gen eral Rothschild does, we should all be working to return our country to course of sanity, civilized conduct and respect for the laws of nations. IN AN ICE AGE Through all‐pervasive snowing may you stay green and growing; but you must take your chances no cold frames, no snow fences. This tamped‐down earth enhances those intimate conjunctions of root with resource under the frost‐line's probing hunger. Now nothing runs or functions; the wires are slick and brittle voice at a breathless standstill as skin fur hide and feather defend from such crisp weather. No chiming, mewling, hooting all silent for your rooting; although what radical sound could penetrate this ground? Now glittering fingers distill our liquids into crystal and crack with no regret a vital thermostat; impale the whale‐white season, stiffen the pulsing lakes . . . a furled leaf your oriflamme, if the ice breaks.

Theater: ‘Sunday Dinner’ Begins Run,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/03/archives/theater-sunday-dinner-begins-run-play-provides-a-view-of-unhappy.html,"When you don't under stand a play, someone has goofed. It may be the play wright; it may be you. Com mon sense argues that it must be the playwright, but a kernel of humility should perhaps admit the tiniest possibility of error. Which brings me, with all puzzle ment, to “Sunday Dinner,” a play by Joyce Carol Oates given last night at the Amer ican Place Theater.  SUNDAY DINNER, a play by Joyce Carol Oates. Directed by Curt Dempster; set ting by Kert Lundell; costumes by Willa Kim; lighting by Roger Morgan; music by Kirk Nurock; production stage manager, Grania Hoskins. Pre sented by the American Place Theater, Wynn Hardman, director. At St. Clement's Church, 423 West 46th Street.  To say I didn't understand a word of it would be totally untrue. I understood every single word. I was just what the words were meaning that skillfully eluded me. Miss Oates has won a number of literary prizes, and I have just been reading some of her short stories, which are both poetic and pungent. Her play is neither. It is a play about a family. It has grown guilt the way old walls grow ivy. Every week it goes to the grave of its mother—the father has deserted years previously— and afterwards it has a fam ily dinner. The graveyard is declining. Even the good old values of guilt and recrim ination are declining. A Tiresias‐like stranger appears. He calls himself a census taker, but he is blind and disconcerting. He asks a few questions, and hears even more answers. He hears of abortion and of cannibalism, of all manner of symbolic crimes. Are they real crimes? The youngest member of the family, doubting whether the census taker is genuinely blind, gouges out his eyes with a spoon. Did he really? As one char acter in the play says, with appropriate knowingness: “I don't believe what happened here. I just cannot absorb it in my mind.” Just so. It is a very brief play—it runs little more than an hour —and Miss Oates clearly in one flashingly symbolic vi gnette wants to expose the violent undercurrents of a quiet‐natured family. Their fears and desires are sudden ly made flesh . . . but the flesh, unfortunately, is obvi ous and flabby. The writing, the symbolism, the obscurantism, are all ter ribly earnest. It is as though Miss Oates imagined that a third‐rate thought—What beasts people are under the surface!—given a second‐rate treatment—dramatic symbol ic realism—might emerge as a first‐rate play. It does not. It seems merely puzzling. Not for what it is, but Why it is. • She at times justifies her self as a good writer. She has the novelist's skill at presenting the meaningful commonplace: A man, having committed a crime, looks at his face and wonders why it hasn't changed. Yes, and I admit, having read and ad mired her before, that there may be more to “Sunday Dinner” than is immediately apparent. But I doubt it. It has that air of self‐satisfied cleverness about it that rare ly surrounds anything more substantial than a reasonably small vacuum. The staging by Curt Demp ster was slow‐paced, almost ponderously ritualistic, but acceptable for its subject matter, and the cast wan dered through the verbal mazes and philosophic cul de sacs with a perky courage. Miss Oates can write. She might be able to write a play. But she has, I fancy, not done so on this occasion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Each Party Registers Gain of Seat in a House,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/04/archives/each-party-registers-gain-of-seat-in-a-house.html,"Republicans fought off a strong Democratic challenge yesterday and, with a big assist from the eight‐year‐old Con servative party, retained con trol of both houses of the State Legislature.  With final results still not tabulated on 15 per cent or more of the races, it appeared the Republicans had won four Assembly races and lost three, for a net gain of one, while the Democrats had picked up one Senate seat. The Democrats had to make a net gain of five seats in each house to take over control. The Republican victory of widest interest came in the 122d Assembly District, taking in Cortland and Cayuga Coun ties, where George M. Michaels, a Democratic‐Liberal, was de nied support of his own Demo cratic party and had to run as a Liberal alone after switching his vote to make possible final passage of the abortion bill. He ran third behind Lloyd S. Riford Jr., a Republican dairy farmer, and John Rossi, the Democratic candidate who placed second. In Queens, Assemblyman Jules D. Sabbatino was upset by John G. Lo Presto Republican Conservative, who won by 522 votes out of 33,000 cast. Mr. Sabbatino had served since 1959. In Erie County, Albert J. Hausbeck, a Republican‐Conser vative after bolting the Demo crats on a sales tax increase, won handily. Democratic gains came in the Manhattan 66th district, where Anthony Oliviere, running with Liberal endorsement, ousted Stephen C. Hansen, a Republi can; in the St. Lawrence 110th where K. D. Haley, a Democrat Liberal, upset Edward J. Kee nan, Republican‐Conservative, and in the Albany‐Rensselaer 102d where T. W. Brown un seated Raymond C. Skuse, a Republican‐Conservative. The Oliviere victory was the first by a Democrat in decades in the 66th, known as the “Silk Stocking district.” Although Senate lines seemed to be holding, the one major turnover came in the defeat of Senator William E. Adams, a Republican, in the 53d District, in Erie and Genesee Counties by John J. LaFalce, 30‐year‐old lawyer who ran on the Demo cratic and Liberal lines. In other Assembly contests Manuel Ramos, the incumbent Democrat in the Bronx 79th district who endorsed Gov ernor Rockefeller for re‐elec tion, was winning his re‐elec tion, won re‐election easily, as did Mrs. Rosemary R. Gunning, the Conservative running also as a Republican in the Queens 34th. Andrew Stein, Democrat Liberal in the Manhattan 62d, ran away from his Republican opponent. Vito P. Battista, Republican running with Conservative sup port in the Brooklyn 38th, also Won easily. As had been anticipated, most of the possible turnovers were expected upstate where the count was slow. In the Syracuse area, however, where Con servative strength is strong, the Republicans, running gen erally with Conservative party endorsement, retained two Senate seats and appeared to be taking all four Assembly seats in Onondaga County. Republicans went into the election controlling the Assem bly by a 79‐to‐71 margin and the Senate 33 to 28. A pivotal figure In the Democratic bid to upset Republican control of the Legislature was Assemblyman Stanley Steingut of Brooklyn, Democratic minority leader of the Assembly, for whom the campaign had poignant im portance. Twenty‐five years earlier, his father, the late Irwin Steingut, who like his son had served as minority leader of the As sembly, was Speaker for a year after the Democrats captured both houses of the Legislature. Seeking to duplicate that sweep, the son took command with Joseph Zaretzki of Man hattan, the Senate minority leader, in planning the cam paign early last year. They sought to build a sound Demo cratic record both in the 1969 and 1970 sessions of the Legislature. They raised $300,000 for the legislative campaign fund at a dinner at the Waldorf‐Astoria Hotel in January, and the money was allocated by a special committee headed by former Gov. W. Averell Harri man. A documentary film, based on the manner in which the Republican majority in the Leg islature and the Republican state administration ran the state for the last two years, was shown extensively on tele vision within the past week by the Democrats. Hard‐Hitting Campaign Like the Republicans, the Democrats did a good deal of newspaper advertising and helped their candidates in pro ducing campaign literature. On the whole, the campaign was one of the most cohesive and hard‐hitting waged by the two major parties in years. The pulling power of the opposing statewide tickets on the legislative election could not be gauged, but unhappiness within Democratic ranks about the Goldberg‐Paterson ticket, high at one point, was largely dissipated as the campaign pro gressed. With Republican administra tions in power in state and na tion, Democrats were hopeful that plant shutdowns and departures from the state, lay offs and joblessness, underem ployment, the rise in the cost of living and other impacts of inflation would produce votes for Democratic legislative can didates. Only three Democrats have been majority leader and presi dent pro tern of the Senate over the last half century, James J. Walker in 1923 and 1924, John J. Dunnigan from 1933 through 1938 and Joseph Zaretzki in 1965. All were from Manhattan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Abortion Is the Issue in Washington State,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/04/archives/abortion-is-the-issue-in-washington-state.html,"SEATTLE, Nov. 3 (UPI) — Emotion‐charged ballot issues, including a referendum on abortion, and unseasonally warm temperatures drew Wash ington voters today in expected record numbers.  The only statewide partisan contest on the ballot was the race for the United States Sen ate, but the overwhelming lead fashioned by Senator Henry M. Jackson, Democrat of Washing ton, in his bid for a fourth term has diminished interest in that contest. The 58‐year‐old Senator was opposed by State Senator Charles W. Elicker, 44, a Re publican. Election officials had pre dicted a 72 per cent turnout of the state's 1,562,267 regis tered voters, which would be a record for an off‐year election. Congressional Contest A contest has developed in only one of the state's seven Congressional districts, and even in that race State Senator Mike McCormack was fighting an uphill battle to unseat Rep resentative Catherine May, a Republican who was Washing ton's first woman in Congress. The abortion referendum is on the question of whether the abortion law in Washington should be liberalized to remove practically all restrictions on abortions performed through the fourth month of pregnancy. The voters were also con sidering a proposed constitu tional amendment that would clear the way for a single rate state income tax, an issue to which Gov. Dan Evans, a Re publican, has attached his prestige. Contest in Oregon PORTLAND, Ore., Nov. 3 (UPI) — Warm weather and hotly contested local races brought out voters in larger than‐usual numbers here and in a few other Oregon cities today. Other areas reported ex tremely light voting after a quiet campaign for the gov ernorship and four seats in Congress. Neither Senate seat was on the ballot. Gov. Torn McCall, a Re publican, was opposed by State Treasurer Robert W. Straub, the man he defeated by 72,000 votes in their 1966 governor ship contest. Mr. McCall, who served as Oregon's Secretary of State before becoming Governor four years ago, said, “This likely will be the last time I'll run for public office.” He is barred by law from serving more than two terms as Governor and said yesterday that the odds were 4 to 1 against his run ning for a Senate seat in 1972. Few issues emerged in the Congressional campaigns as Representative Edith Green sought a ninth term, Repre sentative Al Ullman an eighth term, Representative Wendell Wyatt a fourth term and Repre sentative John R. Dellenback a third term. Mrs. Green and Mr. Ullman are Democrats, and Mr. Wyatt and Mr. Dellenback are Re publicans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/04/archives/letters-to-the-editor.html," To the Editor: Development of a sound population policy is of obvious critical national importance and can occur only if the public has sufficient accurate informa tion to dispel illusions and reject the prejudices that surround population issues. For this reason, I would like to comment on your excellent editorial “Population Outlook.” [Oct. 17.] The baby boom reached a peak, whether expressed in numbers (4.3 million) or rate (122.9 per 1,000 fe males 14–44 years of age), not “almost a decade ago” as stated in your edi torial but thirteen years ago, 1957. These dates are critical to evaluate the impact of the “pill” on birth rates. One can question your use of the terms “undoubtedly” and “major” in claiming a causal relation between falling birth rates and the availability of oral contraceptives, since the rate had fallen for five consecutive years before the pill was generally available in 1962. As the accompanying graph demon strates, the birth rate in 1968 is a continuation of a decline which began in 1957. Many couples who were us ing various forms of contraception chose to change to the pill, but there is little evidence that the declining birth rate could be attributed to pill use alone. Furthermore, now, when the number of pill users is near a peak, the birth rate is showing an increase. The implication that liberalized abortion laws will act as a substantial form of population control in this country is deceptive. There is little objective evidence to back such a statement. When abortion laws are modernized, it is even possible that women who now have legal abortions will tend to be those who, in prior times, submitted to illegal abortions. Abortion laws should and must be modified for humane and public health reasons, but implying that such legislation will have a known predic table and significant impact on population growth in this country is misleading, and invites disappointment and reaction if forecasts fail to mate rialize. Whereas your editorial correctly reported secular changes in birth rate and emphasized the demographic im plications, it failed to focus on a key issue. Dramatic shifts in birth rates have occurred independent of any national population policy and Federal legislation to effect birth rates. Behavioral and economic factors were operational which, in the absence of an ideal contraceptive and in the presence of archaic abortion laws, caused the birth rate to undergo an almost two‐fold change in two major cycles beginning in 1910. By determining the etiology of these alter ations, we can provide the science base for establishing a sound national population policy and be in a position to assist developing countries in generating their own. ‘Democracy’ in Saigon To the Editor: I would like to point out two errors in Jacqueline R. Kasun's letter of Oct. 30, since I believe I am the bishop to whom she referred, having been in Saigon last July. First, at no time have I received word from the Government of South Vietnam nor from our own Govern ment about not coming back to Saigon. Second, I do not think you can say the present Saigon Government per mits demonstrations, since the one I participated in, which was totally non violent, was broken up by gas. It is the considered opinion of al most all the Vietnamese we talked with that the present regime is non representative and could only con tinue in power with the continuance of the war and the support of the United States. Clearly, peace cannot come while a Government whose ex istence depends on war stays in power. The best way to withdraw our in terference in the democratic process in South Vietnam is obviously a com plicated question and depends on many factors. This is no reason it should not be done. We saw firsthand the bruises and wounds which were the result of po lice torture in Saigon, and feel strongly that the United States should not be party to such repression. Comparing the repression in Hanoi to that in Sai gon is irrelevant. We are not support ing North Vietnam. • TV Spending Bill To the Editor: I must emphatically disagree with an Oct. 27 letter by Charles Colson, Special Counsel to the President, con cerning James Reston's column [Oct. 18] on President Nixon's veto of the Political Broadcasting Act of 1970, which limits the amount of money to be spent for television and radio in political campaigns. As a member of the Senate Com merce Committee's subcommittee on communications, which thoroughly considered this bill, and as one of its strongest supporters in the Senate, I applauded Mr. Reston's penetrating analysis of the need for this legisla tion. Mr. Colson does not seem to want to acknowledge the fact that the us of political television advertising has become so out of hand as to affect the very essence of the democratic process. Candidates with limited quali fications but unlimited budgets can now literally buy their way to elective office simply by taking over the air waves with catchy thirty‐second spots. By putting an end to the “campaign blitz,” this bill will force candidates to participate more in substantive debates on issues and thereby give the public a real opportunity to judge the qualifications and views of the can didates. A limit on spending will also encourage more qualified people to run for office, because it lessens the need for a potential candidate to have a personal or family fortune in order to finance his campaign—as is too often the case today. Those of us who worked to get this bill through the Congress are the first to acknowledge that it is only a first step in meeting the need for a com plete overhaul of our laws on cam paign spending. However, this bill will correct the most blatant and inequit able aspect of campaign spending. For these reasons, I will cast my vote in the Senate to override the President's veto when the Congress reconvenes in November. • Causes of Campus Unrest To the Editor: The Op. Ed. page column of Oct. 8 by Joseph Rhodes dealt with the al leged use of campus unrest as a de flecting shield to keep Americans from recognizing the true problems of American society. There are two state ments made by Mr. Rhodes that I would like to challenge. He says “American students have increasingly come to embrace a value system which . . . places human life over all other considerations.”, The assumption is that campus violence which destroys property is of little consequence compared to the alleged evils and violence of American society. Mr. Rhodes does not realize or recog nize that the honoring of law is the only shield we have against an on slaught of unchecked violence which most certainly endangers life. The students who espouse and commit vio lence are abetting its perpetuation. When a law intended to promote order and rationality is violated, we move closer to an unchecked state of nature in which people settle differences of perception and view by the use of force. Mr. Rhodes also states that “almost no one in America is happy.” This seems to me a generalized psycholog ical projection of the worst kind. It may be that our institutions are in need of change and that they do not serve all the people, but I believe that personal happiness is not a function of society's institutions. The great malaise afflicting Americans may be religious, spiritual or moral in nature, and the unrest our young people feel may be an inability to come to terms with this inscrutable malaise. • Nixon's Moral Leadership To the Editor: Obviously, when the name is “Rich ard Nixon,” he is “damned if he does and he's damned if he doesn't.” In the Scranton Report he was taken to task for not exerting more “moral leadership” in the fight against cam pus violence. When he rejects as “mor ally bankrupt” the report of the Na tional Commission on Obscenity” and Pornography, thereby exercising that “moral leadership” which the Scranton Report very strangely found missing (I did not) he is lambasted in your Oct. 26 editorial. Incidentally, I have yet to meet any one who isn't fed up with the obscene and degrading “literature,” movies and the theater. Who isn't delighted that the President spoke out as he did on the subject? The problem of obscenity and the concurrent decline, if not complete ab sence, of all moral standards is as “real” as any of the many other prob lems facing our nation, and, speaking out on one does not necessarily ex clude awareness of others, as the President has evidenced on many occa sions. But alas, “poor Nixon,” The Times simply doesn't like him. BESS N. SHAPIRO Brooklyn, Oct. 26, 1970 • George Kennan's Caution To the Editor: In attacking Charles Reich's two Op. Ed. columns, George Kennan (Op. Ed. Oct. 28) is being just as arbitrary as the author of “The Greening of Amer ica.” Kennan calls it all “romantic utopian moods, illusions and hys terias.” Teaching high school students, how ever, I have in recent years confronted a much harder core of fresh new ideal ism and determination than could ever be moderated by Kennanesque caution. Reich may be rhapsodic, but it's the Kennans who are outdated. Today's young know that it was a basic men tality that has brought civilization to this pass, and that this mentality will not get us out again. They will never, I'm convinced, settle for Conscious ness II‐½. • To Keep China Out of U.N. To the Editor: The letter of Prof. Edwin O. Reischauer and his colleagues (Oct. 28) stating that “world peace and inter national conciliation will be better served by having [Communist] China inside the U.N. than outside” calls for a counter consideration. It seems to us that admission of Red China into the U.N. would bring about unendurable confusion and frustration in an organization which is not even now receiving the support, moral or economic, that it needs from major powers (especially Soviet Russia). It would bring into the U.N. the bitter antagonism that exists between the Peking regime and the Nationalist Government; it would turn the U.N. into an arena of struggle between Peking and Moscow. It would enable Red China to work at its world subversive program on a high level; it would eventually give Red China a seat on the Security Council with a veto on the activities of that most important international body, an international body specifically designed to keep the peace that Peking is constantly breaking. Beyond these effects, admission of Red China would be a betrayal of the Chinese people, for it would strengthen the present tenuous hold an oppres sive government still has on a people who show their dissatisfaction more intensely each year, As a result of this Red China presence, confidence in the U.N. might wane to a disastrous degree in the popular feeling of those countries that are now its firmest supporters, and trust in the U.N. would disappear, since the basic principles of its Charter would be violated.

Rockefeller and Buckley Are Supported in Suffolk,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/04/archives/rockefeller-and-buckley-are-supported-in-suffolk.html,"YAPHANK, L I., Wednesday, Nov. 4—Split‐ticket voting yes terday gave Republican Gover nor Rockefeller and James L. Buckley, the Conservative can didate for the United States Senate, commanding pluralities in Suffolk County.  But Representative Otis G. Pike, the Democratic ineu bent in the first Congressional District, appeared to be buck ing this tide in incomplete re turns last night. Mr. Pike was leading in an extremely close race with Malcolm E. Smith Jr., his Republican‐Conserva tive opponent. In the Second Congressional District, James R. Grover Jr., the Republican‐Conservative in cumbent, easily defeated Har vey W. Sherman, Democrat Liberal. The district covers the town of Huntington and Baby lon in Suffolk County and part of Oyster Bay in Nassau County. With 306 out of 410 election districts reporting, Mr. Pike had 80,138 votes to Mr. Smith's 73,431. The district comprises the eight eastern towns of Suffolk County. In other races, Perry B. Duryea Jr., the Speaker of the State Assembly, was re‐elected in a contest in which his vote in favor of abortion reform was heavily criticized by his op ponents, Democrat Michael Contant and Conservative Dominick J. Santoro. In the Fourth Assembly Dis trict, the Republican candidate, Robert C. Wertz, was leading his Democratic opponent, Paul Creditor, for the seat being va cated by Prescott Huntington, a Republican, who retired this year. All the incumbents were ahead comfortably in the other Assembly and state Senate races. With the exception of Assemblyman Charles A. Jerabek, who is a Conservative, all are Republicans. With 481 of 633 election dis tricts reporting, Mr. Buckley had 128,127 votes; Represent ative Richard. L. Ottinger, 68, 413, and Senator Charles E. Goodell, 52,751. Mr. Buckley had been expected to do very well in Suffolk, where Repub lican party officials made no secret of their admiration for him. Although the Conservative party had only about 3 per cent of the registered voters, it has polled about 20 per cent in recent elections and party officials were confident that this would increase to about 30 per cent for all its candi dates this year. With 499 of the 633 election, districts reporting, Mr. Rocke feller had 149,049 votes to Ar thur J. Goldberg's 75,581. Dr. Paul L. Adams, the Conserva tive party candidate, had 34,727. Mr. Pike, who is considered a moderate if not conservative Democrat, was first elected to Congress in 1960 and has been the most successful Democrat for many years in this tradi tionally Republican area. Mr. Smith ran an extensive cam paign in which he strongly backed the policies of the Nixon Administration. Two referendums to amend the County Charter were ap proved by overwhelming mar gins. One would establish an environmental bill of rights. The other would extend the review power of the Suffolk Planning Commission to include zoning changes within one mile of a nuclear power plant or airport. The voters also lined up against the statewide proposi tion to increase the amount of state funds available to help local housing authorities fi nance new low‐rent housing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LEGISLATURE VOTE PLEASES DURYEA,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/05/archives/legislature-vote-pleases-duryea-gop-hold-over-majority-called-sign.html,"The Legislature came out of the Tuesday election a shade less Republican, but Assembly Speaker Perry B. Duryea Jr., declared yesterday that he viewed the results as “tanta mount to an endorsement”  “It was a vote of confidence in us for the way we conducted the legislative business of the state during the past two years,” he said. Mr. Duryea noted that the Republicans had retained the precise 79‐to‐71 majority in the Assembly that they had going into the election and, while dropping a seat, still controlled the Senate, 32 to 25. And he added that, despite 10 changes in the composition of the Assembly that balanced out five and five for each party, the political philosophy there and in the Senate as well would remain essentially what it was and that cooper ation with Governor Rockefel ler would be assured. The Speaker revealed that he had gone into a $5 pool with legislative colleagues on the number of seats the Republi cans would have in the next Assembly and won it by pick ing the precise number—79. “But I must confess,” he said, “I feel a little lucky with 10 seats changing hands.” The fact that the Democrats, who had been highly optimistic about possible gains in the Assembly, actually made their only net gain in the Senate was something of a surprise. Democratic Senate Gain The gain was in the 53d District, embracing part of Erie County and Genesee Coun ty, where John J. LaFalce, a 30‐year‐old lawyer with. Demo cratic‐Liberal endorsement, up set Senator William E. Adams. On election eve, Governor Rockefeller, flying into Buffalo to rally the voters, coupled an appeal for backing of Senator Charles E. Goodell with one for the re‐election of Mr. Adams as “a standup guy.” Senator Adams stood trial and was acquitted last spring on a series of charges of per jury arising out of testimony he gave in a Federal investi gation of corruption and fraud in the Medicaid program. The changeovers in the As sembly saw the Republicans dropping seats in the 18th dis trict in Nassau, the 66th in Manhattan, the 102d in the Al bany‐Rensselaer area, the 110th in St. Lawrence, and the 139th in Erie, while picking up the 32d in Queens, the 120th in Onondaga, the 122d in Cayuga Cortland, the 138th in Niagara and the 144th in Erie. In the Nassau 18th, which has been a Republican strong hold, the defeat of Assembly man Vincent R. Balletta Jr. was attributed by political analysts largely to his vote for relaxa tion of abortion laws. The winner was I. J. Landes, a Democrat‐Liberal. G.O.P. Loses Stronghold In an energetic campaign in the 17th—part of the so‐called Silk Stocking District —Anthony G. Olivieri, a Democratic‐Liberal, unseated Stephen C. Hansen, a Republican who had won the seat two years ago. The victory was the first by a Democrat in the district in 54 years. Mr. Olivieri's victory was by 495 votes out of nearly 35,000 cast. T. W. Brown captured a normally Democratic seat in the 102d, defeating Raymond C. Skuse, Republican‐Conservative. Another young Democrat, J. D. Haley, running with Liberal support, defeated Edward J. Keenan, Republican‐Conserva tive in the 110th. Lloyd J. Long, Republican, was defeated by M. L. Mc Carthy in the 139th. Since the Democrats needed only five new seats to win the Assembly, control would have changed hands if the Repub licans had not been able to un seat some Democrats. Major G.O.P. Victories This lent importance to the Republican victories of J. G. Lopresto over J. G. Sabbatino, in the 32d, E. M. Kindsella over Mortimer Gallivan in the 120th, and Lloys S. Riford Jr. over George M. Michaels in the 122d. Mr. Michaels, a dairy farmer, was denied renomination by the Democrats after switching his vote on the abortion reform bill to permit its final passage in the Legislature. Running as a Liberal, he ran third behind Mr. Riford and the Democrat. Albert Hausbeck, who had been elected as a Democrat two years ago in the 144th District in Erie County, broke with his party to vote with the Republi cans for an increase in the state sales tax and so was denied re nomination. He won as a Re publican‐Conservative. And in the 138th in Niagara County, R. J. Hogan scored over J. K. Murphy, Democrat Liberal. He was the only Re publican among the winners in turnovers running with Con servative endorsement. Of the 79 Republicans in the new Republican majority in the Assembly, 40 sought and got Conservative endorsement. In the Senate, 15 of the 32 winning Republicans had Conservative backing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Plans to Lower Vote Age Defeated in Most States,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/05/archives/plans-to-lower-vote-age-defeated-in-most-states.html,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 4 (AP) —Proposals to lower the voting age were rejected in most of the 15 states where the ques tion was on the ballot yester day. And while Texans voted to permit saloons to reopen, Kansans voiced a resounding “no.”  There were at least 400 such special measures on the ballots in 45 states, and the other results—without the vote count complete—included these key ones: ¶Massachusetts voters sup ported President Nixon's plan ned withdrawal from Vietnam over alternatives of immediate withdrawal or a drive for a military victory. ¶Virginia, by a close vote, removed a ban on lotteries from the state Constitution, opening up the way for possible horse racing and pari‐mutuel betting. But Arizona voters turned down a lottery proposi tion. ¶Washington state voters approved a measure to legal ize abortions performed by licensed physicians in accred ited hospitals or other medical facilities. ¶Marylanders approved a constitutional amendment to permit voluntary prayers in public schools. In Nebraska, a proposal to permit state aid to private and parochial schools was rejected. Michigan voters were approving a ban on pay ing salaries of parochial school teachers. With the voting count in complete it appeared that Maine and Nebraska approved of lowering the voting age from 21 to 20, Montana and Massa chusetts to lower it to 19 and Alaska to drop it from 19 to 18. But voters in Washington, Colorado, Wyoming, South Da kota, New Jersey and Minne sota apparently voted against lowering it to 19 and Connecticut, Florida, Michigan and Hawaii voted down proposals for on 18‐year‐old vote. The big surprise was Hawaii, which already had the 20 year vote and where all major candi dates backed lowering it to 18. The Supreme Court has agreed to review a Federal law passed this year lowering the voting age to 18. Despite recent voter resist ance to new bond issues, sev eral big ones were accepted, notably those tied to antipollu tion empaigns. The biggest was a $750‐million bond issue over whelmingly approved in Illinois for local sewage disposal systems. Florida voters agreed to increase?? the amount of money available to clean up sewage treatment by allowing the state to pledge its support to bond issues for construction of waste treatment, facilities. Another measure approved in Florida guarantees that state owned lands will be sold only in the public interest. Rhode Island voters approved five bond issues and an en vironmental “bill of rights??” But Washington state voters rejected an antilittering mea sure—an initative to require a 5‐cent deposit on bottles and beer cans. The voters balked at giving pay raises to the legislators. In Rhode Island they rejected an increase from $300 to 3,000 a year. A referendum in Missouri to provide pensions primarily benefitting legislators and other state officials was overwhelm ingly rejected. Arkansas's new proposed Constitution, endorsed by all three candidates for governor, was rejected, as was one in Indiana that had been in prep aration for four years. But Virginians approved their new constitution by an overwhelm ing margin, the first major re vision in 42 years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Recount Due in Assembly Race Won Uptown by 6‐Vote Margin,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/06/archives/recount-due-in-assembly-race-won-uptown-by-6vote-margin.html,"A recount will be made Mon day of the unofficial election night tally showing Edward H. Lehner, the Democratic candi date, winning an Assembly seat in Manhattan's 73d district with a six‐vote plurality in a five‐way race. The request for the recount was made by the incumbent Democratic Assemblyman, John J. Walsh, who lost by 550 votes to Mr. Lehner in the primary and then ran as an independent. Mr. Walsh polled 11,338 votes as the only candidate of the Upper Manhattan Apartment Building party to 11,344 for Mr. Lehner. Thomas Mullany, Conservative, was third with 2,552 votes, H. J. Wallenstein, Republican, fourth with 2,244 votes and Roger P. Quinby, Liberal, last with 848 votes. The 73d district takes in the Washington Heights ‐ Inwood area where the electorate north of Dyckman Street is largely Irish Catholic and largely Jew ish to the south. Mr. Walsh's vote against the abortion bill at the last session was used extensively against him in both the primary and general elec tion. Three other recounts, all of them involving Assembly races, will be given priority in the regular canvass starting Tues day. A recount is no more than an early canvass certifying the official vote. They involve races in the 32d District in Queens and the 63d and 66th Districts in Manhat tan. In the 32d, Jules G. Sab batino, the Democratic incum bent who has been in the As sembly since 1959, lost in the unofficial returns, 16.827 to 16,270 to John G. Lopresto, Republican‐Conservative. The Lib eral candidate, Ivan C. Lafayette, got 2,439 votes. In the 66th, Stephen Hansen, Republican incumbent, was de feated by Anthony G. Olivieri, Democrat‐Liberal, by 495 votes. The unofficial tally here was 17,689 for Mr. Olivieri, 17,194 for Mr. Hansen and 1,519 for Patricia R. Greene, the Con servative.

SOUTHEAST ASIANS DISCUSS GROWTH,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/08/archives/southeast-asians-discuss-growth-aides-of-9-nations-divided-on.html,"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, Nov. 7 (AP) — Representatives of Southeast Asian nations who met here this week to discuss population growth had di vergent feelings on how — or whether — to control it.  Nine countries in the region are estimated to have 280 mil lion people. In the next 15 years, experts say, the popula tion will increase more than 50 per cent, adding 147 million people to be fed, clothed, housed, educated and employed. Singapore, with 9,000 per sons per square mile, has adopted a vigorous family‐plan ning policy, which has cut the growth rate by half — to 2 per cent — in recent years. She is the only country in the region with legal abortion. Malaysia, which opposes abortion, is the only other coun try to fix a specific target in her population program. She wants last year's 3 per cent growth cut to 2 per cent by 1985. Little Urgency Expressed Little urgency for such plan ning was evident among of ficials from Cambodia, Indo nesia, Laos, Nepal, the Philip pines, Thailand and South Viet nam. The Cambodian Social Wel fare Minister, Chau Xeng Aar, said: “In Cambodia, population growth does not pose an acute problem because we still have vast regions in the north and northeast to be developed. The welfare of the Cambodian peo ple is not yet jeopardized by the birth rate, so there is no need to consider limited family size as an ideal.” Indonesia's social welfare minister, Dr. Kijai Hadji Idham, disagreed. “Demographically, economically, socially and po litically, the situation in South east Asia is one of the most critical in the world,” he said. The belief that sparsely populated nations need more people quickly “neglects the fact that large capital expen ditures are necessary for culti vation and settlement in empty land,” he added. Average population growth rates in 1960‐68 ranged from 1.9 per cent for Nepal to Singa pore's 2.3 per cent. The Philip pines’ 3.5 per cent was highest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A Second Chance—In Paperback,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/08/archives/a-second-chancein-paperback-a-second-chance.html,"From time to time during the past several years the Book Review has commented on the progress—or lack of it — in the field of paperback books for children. This year we asked David Dempsey, a veteran ob server of the publishing industry, to take another look. His findings, pre sented in the form of an interview with himself, are given, unexpur gated, herewith. Question: By the way, who is Wil lie? Answer: Willie is your average ju venile — and I don't mean delin quent — ranging in age from 4 to 16, for whom the term “young peo ple's books” was invented. About 10 years ago, hardcover publishers be gan courting him as a market for inexpensive reprints. But somehow the tidal wave of paperbacks that transformed the adult book field only lapped at the shores of juvenilia, leav ing Willie gasping like a fish thrown up on the beach, The only place where he could get most of these books was in school. A few years ago, Beverly Grun wald pointed out in these pages that it was very difficult to buy a chil dren's paperback in New York book stores. The situation is changing as the price of hardcover books goes higher, but not much. There are 100, 000 outlets for adult paperbacks in the United States, but fewer than 10,000 for children's books. The kids ought to add this to their list of complaints. Q: This country can't stand another grievance. A: I withdraw my suggestion. Q: And I don't see why, if this is the case, it's been such a great year for Willie. A: Because the schools have done what the industry hasn't. Right now they're the biggest distributor of pa perbacks in the country. More than 400,000 classrooms take part in the Scholastic Book Club operation — five different clubs, from kindergar ten through high school. Over 65 mil lion books a year—think of it! The Weekly Reader's three clubs—as you know, they're owned by Xerox—sells its selections to 100,000 classrooms. The major houses, both hard and softcover, are all getting “adoptions” for their curriculum‐related reprints. I might add that for many publishers, “curriculum‐related” is almost any ting this side of “Valley of the Dolls.” But I don't think we should get hung up on the distribution problem at the retail level. The publishers are trying very hard to change this situ ation—designing special racks, etc. What interests me is content. For long time the lines that made the pa per covers were usually classics: “Robinson Crusoe,” “Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm,” “Treasure Island”— the old stand‐bys. Now we're adding a lot of gutsy books to the reper toire, giving kids a really sophisti cated mix to choose from. Q: You mean, can “Winnie the Pooh” find happiness on the same shelf with Paul Zindel's “The Pig man”? A: Exactly. Or “Charlotte's Web” with “The Nitty Gritty.” The latter has a ghetto setting. It's mostly black. Morrow is bringing out “Too Bad About the Haines Girl, which is about an unwed mother. “I'll Get There — It Better Be Worth the Trip” includes a homosexual theme. These were all hardcover originals, but the softcover reprints are making the impact. In a way they mirror the adult concern with modern life in a more responsible fashion. Not just exploiting a subject, you know, but dealing with it on a moral— you might say an educational — lev el., That's why I fear for the future of adult paperbacks if this thing ever catches on. Q: But you can go just so far in this direction. A: Well, so far is quite a way. Two of my favorite “now” books are “Self‐Defense for Boys and Men” and “Self‐Defense for Girls.” Bantam de veloped these for use in the schools. Q: Defense against whom? The teachers? A: Oh, no. The teachers demon strate the techniques. Let me quote from a lesson plan: “Session 2—Heel of‐the‐palm blow and uses; side‐of fist blow; thumb press into throat; repeat explanation of value of kick.” Session 3 reviews “finger stab and finger pulling.” Gang, that's what I call being with it. Q: They didn't write ’em like that when I was growing up. A: They didn't have to. Young peo ple today are living in a completely new world. And they're not going to find the answers they're looking for or the understandings they need, as far as books are concerned, at $4.95 a copy. They want a piece of the ac tion, not a seat in the library. Paper backs do that beautifully. Marijuana smoking, abortion, the poverty bag — these are some of the Young Adult themes that are tak ing the kids’ minds off their pimples. But as George Nicholson, of Holt Rine hart & Winston, points out, it's the “scale” of these books and the man ner of approach that make them young rather than adult. The books are bridges to a kind of maturity that will come in its own good time. You've got to know how to handle not only the problems but the adult books about the problems. Q: Let's go back to something I said a moment ago, the matter of children's classics and how they fit into the new sophistication. Do kids still read “Robinson Crusoe”? A: Oh, yes. And “Huckleberry Finn” and “Gulliver's Travels,” which, you know, was a pretty sophis ticated book in its day. The easiest way for a publisher to get a paper back line started is to reach into this bottomless barrel called public domains In the meantime, a new gen eration of classics has come along. Among teen‐agers, “The Catcher in the Rye” has supplanted books like “Penrod” — they're really about the same kind of guy, you know; but what a world of difference! The kids are “trading up” these days, while their parents are “trading down.” Is “The Hobbit” an advanced children's book or a regressed ad ult's? Frankly, rve never been able to read the Tolkien series; but ob viously there's no generation gap here. They're listed “for ages 7 to 14” but enjoyed as well by the over 30's. Q: You look as though you wanted to coin another phrase. A: Yes. All power to the little peo ple. Q: Right on! A: But the thing to remember is that until Ballantine Books put the Hobbits into paper covers, they were virtually unknown in this country. It's a case where the reprint made the books classics, whereas it used to be the other way round — a book was reprinted because it was a classic. Children's paperbacks are doing this for dozens and dozens of books. And they're doing something else. They're breaking the price barrier. You know, it's a funny thing about the book business but with adult best sellers the publisher wants very much to see the book reprinted. Not right away, of course, but within a year or two. But kids’ best‐sellers tend to stay in hard covers. It's only in the last few years that publishers have discovered they make as much, if not more, by licensing these books for reprint. The big breakthrough came in 1967 when Harper & Row sold Dell the rights to E. B. White. “Char lotte's Web” is now approaching million copies in paperback. A more recent example is A. A. Milne, whose books Dutton finally licensed this fall. You can't pooh‐pooh that. Q: Ouch! A: I think we're going to see more of this sort of thing. These books are written for an age group that has n't started to scrape the bubble gum off the wall yet, and they're not ready for Salinger or Nat Hent off. But they'll sit Still for Paula Fox and John Tunis and Virginia Hamilton. This 6‐to‐12 crowd has always been a spec ial problem for publishers; and the hardcover houses that started their own reprint lines —I'm thinking of Viking's Sea farer imprint and Harcourt's Voyager books—have focused chiefly on this market. This fall Collier Books is launching a new softcover line that will include C. S. Lewis's “Narnia” series. Holt, Rinehart & Win ston and Harper & Row are planning similar ventures for next year. All of their reprints will be taken from the firms backlists, which means that these titles won't be licensed to the big reprint houses. Q: That ought to shake up the industry. A: And a good thing, be cause the industry has priced its hardbound originals right out of the market. Production costs have gotten to the point where a 32‐page picture book can cost $4.95 at retail. It's no secret that the children's book business is very slow right now. Federal money is drying up; and what a friend of mine calls the “lavish devotion” that teachers and librarians have for expensive, hardcover books is becoming a luxury. But high prices have made the business less duplicative; and that's a good thing, too. There's no room for two books on the North Pole every year, so we're getting just one. A juvenile book editor I know is predicting that, except for library editions, his firm may drop hardcover children's books entirely. This could be come a trend. And the implica tions are enormous. The fact that you have to publish five or six times as many copies of a given book in paper as you do in boards to make it pay means that you're going to have just that many more cop ies of a boolc in circulation. What we're seeing is not only a revolt against price but against the library as an arbiter of taste. This is entirely a paperback phenomenon. Q: And about time. A: Well, yes, although I don't want to imply that li brarians don't have the kids’ interests at heart. But they are notorious for buying books that adults—prize committees, and so forth—think the children ought to like, instead of buying books that kids shouldn't like but do. To this day, there are libraries that won't stock “Dr. Dolittle.” The paperback revolt makes it possible to enjoy both the bad and the good. This power is now passing to the teacher. Young people's paperbacks today are edited with school adoption in mind, and for most reprinters of chil dren's bookt this represents more than half of their total business. The next step is to let the kids choose; and, in the case of book clubs like Scho lastic's, this is what is happen ing. The weak link in the dis tribution chain is at the retail level. In England, you know, these paperbacks are a com monplace in stores. Puffin Books—one of the Penguin lines—distributes well over 500 titles. They are sold in railway stations, on newsstands, at the airports. The British are way ahead of us on this score. But there's some hope that the situation here is improving. Publisher's Weekly sent a ques tionnaire on this subject to bookstores. What they found was that the average store now sports a separate children's paperback section with about 100 titles—I say average be cause some stores don't handle these books at all, whereas others carry 400 or 500 titles. With new lines coming on the market, the pressure to expand these departnients will in crease. And with more com petition, quality should im prove, too. Q: Our time is about over. Can you sum up? A: Yes. Next year should be even better for Willie. In read ing, thanks to paperbacks, we're on the threshold of a Kids Liberation Movement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HELPERN UPHOLDS CURB ON ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/08/archives/helpern-upholds-curb-on-abortion-7-of-10-deaths-took-place-outside.html,"New York City's Chief Medi cal Examiner yesterday cited cases of abortion deaths in the city to “show the wisdom” of the new regulation that essen tially prohibits abortions in doc tors’ offices or in ill‐equipped clinics.  Dr, Milton Helpern, the ex aminer, reported that there had been 10 known abortion deaths in the city since the liberalized state law went into effect in July. Seven of the deaths followed abortions outside accredited hospitals. One was known to have been a result of an abor tion performed in a doctor's office. The circumstances sur rounding the six others were described as undetermined and, in some cases; suspicious. Many of the victims were sent to hos pitals too late to be saved. Investigating Deaths Dr. Helpern discussed these statistics at a symposium for medical examiners and coroners held at his office, 520 First Ave nue. The three‐day meeting, which ends today, deals with official investigation of medi cally unattended, unexpected, sudden, suspicious and violent deaths. In a separate speech at the symposium, Dr. Valentino Maz zia, chairman of the Depart ment of Anesthesiology of New York University School of Med ??cine, warned that halothane, ??he nation's most popular an esthetic, could kill a patient allergic to it. Dr. Mazzia reported that he had found halothane to be responsible for more than 20 deaths during operations in Manhattan since 1961. At the same time, he cautioned that all general and spinal anes thetics were dangerous. Before abortions became legal on request in the state, there were 30 to 60 deaths in the city a year, Dr. Helpern said. He added that the percentage of deaths to abortions—there were more than 16,000 abortions since July — was undoubtedly much lower now than when abortions were being performed ??llegally. Critics of the ban on abor tions in offices maintain that there is still no evidence that in normal circumstances they are any more dangerous than hos pital abortions. They point out that only one of the abortion deaths thus far resulted from an office abortion by an accredited physician. There were apparently ex tenuating circumstances in all three of the deaths from hos pital abortions. A 42‐year‐old victim suffered a cardiac arrest shortly after the abortion, pre sumably a reaction to the an esthesia. A 23‐year‐old woman's death was attributed primarily to sickle‐cell anemia, a condi tion that complicated her re covery. The third victim, a 31‐year old woman, was not in good physical condition to begin with. She was said to have had a history of rheumatic heart disease and of drug addiction. She died when the salt solution, injected to kill the fetus and in duce labor, got into the circ ulatory system. Dies of Bleeding The one case of death from an office abortion was reported earlier. The victim was a 23 year‐old factory worker from Boston who came, with her common‐law husband, to New York for the abortion. The pro cedure, according to the Medi cal Examiner's records, took only 10 minutes (at a cost of $400), and the woman was sent away in a taxi. A few hours later, the woman died of internal bleeding. Her ??terus had been perforated by ??he abortion procedure. “This is a real example of the need for the new regulations on office abortions,” Dr. Helpern said. In the other cases, Dr. Hel pern said, the abortions were apparently performed by un authorized people. The facts are sketchy, the examiner said, be cause the police are not in vestigating these cases as dili gently as they did when all abortions were considered crim inal acts. The victims died of a variety of problems, including uterus perforation, widespread infec tion, shock and the presence of air bubbles and other foreign particles in the bloodstream.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All Pregnant Girls Have Boy Babies,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/08/archives/all-pregnant-girls-have-boy-babies-pregnant-girls.html,"Teen‐age pregnancy has now been admitted to the narrow circle of sub jects deemed fit for the teen‐age reader. I suppose that these novels will appeal to girls who like the general run of teen‐age fiction: they can be certain that here they will find a strong story line (both author and reader know at every step ex actly what's got to come next) fleshed out with realistic details (though one would never gather from these books that not every pregnant woman suf fers from morning sickness). They can enjoy the comfort of reading about a troublesome event in the ambience of a cosy status quo. One suspects that the books serve a further purpose: to convince the juvenile publisher that by providing a category called “teen‐age preg nancy” he's facing up to life today and being more honest and infor mative than he used to be. If he be lieves that, he's kidding himself. The times have changed, and the publish ers have moved along; but on the evidence of these books they're still bringing up the rear, as distant from the vanguard as they ever were. I've read six of these novels, three from a year or more back and three just coming out this fall; the six were so alike that I found the chief dif ficulty in reviewing them to be re membering which was which. Let's take the three new ones. They are called PHOEBE by Patricia Dizenzo (McGraw‐Hill, $4.95), also available in paperback (Bantam, 75 cents); YESTERDAY'S CHILD by Ann Victor (Lippincott, $3.95) and THE LONGEST WEEKEND by Honor Arundel (Nel son, $3.95). They have an awful lot in common. To wit: they are each ex plicit about the symptoms of preg nancy, the panic of the girl, her loneliness upon finding herself preg nant. Each girl is her parent's only child and has trouble communicating. Each is a “good” girl, and each book makes the point that it's the “good” girls who get caught. Ob viously we are meant to believe that here we have the story of your daugh ter and mine. Why is it then that the heart sinks at the contemplation of these explicit and not ill‐written books? The reason is that the girls who are at the heart of the books, like slaves, like once‐loved animals pa thetic in their suffering, are acted upon. There is not one of them with the smallest sense of destiny, of herself as a specially valuable human being rather than as a host of fe male organs, not one of them who could imagine herself as an autono mous being. If we are going to continue telling young readers that women are not much more than throbbing wombs, then we will con tinue to have trouble unless we lock them up until they marry. If, how ever, we wish to have a world oc cupied by female youngsters who are also human beings, then we must give them a sense that they have destiny and that their sexual life should be seen as part of that destiny. In each of these books the girl dreams her way through school bored. In each, her status derives from the attentions of boys. In each, while the boy considers what he might become and looks on fatherhood as one aspect of these plans, the girl thinks of nothing but shame, what the neighbors will think, when her clothes will fit again and how she will return to her previous life. What life? is a question not asked. “The Longest Weekend,” a British book, is the slickest and best written of the lot and not really a teen‐age pregnancy story at all. The father is soon to graduate from medical school, is witty and attractive; in love with the girl, thinks she is using the pill and ends up marrying her and claim ing their three‐year‐old child. It's a pleasant story with a good deal of truth about the difficulties of spend ing whole days in the exclusive company of a three‐year‐old, and plenty of romance. Since it all ends happily, it hasn't very much to do with the problems of pregnancy, but rather of a girl who decides to let the nice man love her. Probably just the thing to read after a hard day studying American history. Of the other two, “Phoebe” is re grettably the better, “regrettably” be cause its excellence so clearly de rives from the sex education film that was its previous incarnation. One can see the film as one reads, and it is certainly to be recommended to anyone who wonders what it's like to discover yourself pregnant, what follows the discovery if you can have an abortion (they are illegal in this book) and what are the difficul ties of talking to one's parents about the matter. “Yesterday's Child” complicates it self with argumentative parents, drinking father who manages to un derstand and one of those impossible mothers who never understands any thing. The story carries the heroine though the institution where she has the baby (a boy, of course; teen‐age heroines who enter these homes al ways have boys); and if any girl ever wondered about these homes, she need wonder no longer. Well, what did I want? Assuming that the authors and publishers are really trying to explore a very dif ficult and complex problem and not just titillate their readers while de livering a terrible warning, what could these books present that would touch with some profundity upon the problems of teen‐age sexuality? We have achieved—and it has been the struggle of centuries—some de gree of enlightenment and tolerance about sexual relations unsanctified by matrimony. Victorian authors took their lives in their hands writing about such a subject. George Eliot had to hang her unmarried mother Mrs. Gaskell suffered for not trying to send hers to coventry; and even in our own century, when H.G. Wells allowed his heroine to have a baby with her lover and then marry some one else, he raised such a storm that we have to shoot down college students to match it today. We don't think that because a girl has had an illegitimate baby she ought to be treated like a criminal; but neither do we come right out and tell girls the facts of life, the chief of which is that if a girl has sexual intercourse without contraceptives she may get pregnant (and life being what it is, she probably will). Only “The Longest Weekend” makes this point explicitly, though the others re fer vaguely to contraceptive prob lems that the girls never really face up to. We have now provided places where unmarried girls can go to have their babies and adoption agencies that will find homes for them. Is this what the problem is all about? Things were certainly easier for Sam uel Johnson who, when Boswell tried to defend an adulterous woman, said: “My dear Sir, never accustom your mind to mingle virtue and vice. The woman's a whore, and there's an end on't.” At least the poor woman knew where she stood. Today, the girl is told that looks are all, that popu larity with boys is central, that not to be cute enough to be picked out by an adolescent boy is death. But she is never told about her own sex ual development or her own identity. What of the teen‐ager who has lifted “Phoebe” from the fiction shelves of the library? She will never learn from this or any other teen age fiction that with the population problems today she must not look to pregnancy as the major event in her life, but as one among several major events, just as a boy looks to father hood. She must learn that her life, like the boy's, can be ordered to wards work she finds absorbing, re warding or simply necessary, that her sexuality must fallow a pattern that is hers and not only a response to a boy's sexuality. The sexuality of boys is continuous. As they grow to sexuality and reach, very soon, the most sexually de manding period of their lives, sex with a woman will be similar to the sexual experience they have already had. Not so with a girl. For her, according to all studies, sex begins with intercourse, not before it. For her, sex is an initiation, be cause only then does she dis cover her sexual self. Girls grow to full sexuality after ex perience with a boy for whom they feel affection at the least, at best love and a sense of com munion. Therefore the tension between a boy who will de mand sex in the rear of a car with a girl whose name he does not know, and a girl who wishes to awaken to true sexu ality is a real tension and must, be faced. The double standard, the “virginity mystique,” is still with us and must be discussed and appraised in the light of a new world and new knowledge. Having read these books, honest in their way but so achingly hollow at the center where a human being is sup posed to be, I would like to suggest that the next teen‐age book be a discussion, by sev eral post‐teen‐age boys and girls, of the problems I have named. Take it down on tape and edit it. Talk about every thing from what Masters and Johnson have discovered about female sexuality to male adoles cent needs, from women's lib and whether boys ought to pay on dates to the whole question of femininity. It won't be a novel, it might not even be a book of lasting interest; but we would all learn some thing, especially teen‐agers. If we're not, with S. Johnson, go ing to call the teen‐age mother a whore, let's give her a chance to think of herself as something other than a teen age mother.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Recanvass Names Walsh Victor By 99 Votes in Assembly Race,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/10/archives/recanvass-names-walsh-victor-by-99-votes-in-assembly-race.html,"Assemblyman John J. Walsh of Manhattan, the unofficial loser in the initial Election Day tally last week, turned out to be the winner by 99 votes yes terday in the official recan vass. After the tally was an nounced by Maurice J. O'Rourke, president of the Board of Elections, Mr. Walsh, a Democrat who has been in the Legislature for 12 years, immediately hurried to his sound truck to thank the Wash ington Heights‐Inwood voters. Edward H. Lehner, an insur gent Democrat who defeated Mr. Walsh in the primary by 550 votes and registered a 6 vote victory margin in the un official count last week, be came the loser in the 73d As sembly District. He speculated that an eleventh‐hour “smear” —a handbill depicting him as “Lehner the Landlord's Lawyer” —had been a crucial factor. “There was no way to coun ter it,” Mr. Lehner said of the small blue handbill, which he said had been widely circulated on the day before election. He contended the handbill was the work of the Walsh campaign, but Mr. Walsh denied any con nection with it. Mr. Walsh polled 11,463 votes in the official count, running as an independent of the Upper Manhattan Apartment Build ing party. Mr. Lehner, the Democrat, received 11,364 votes, while Herbert J. Wal lenstein, Republican, received 2,195 votes. Thomas C. Mul laney, Conservative, was third with 3,242, and Roger P. Quin by, Liberal, was last with 818 votes. Mr. Walsh contended that his votes in this year's session against abortion reform and for extra aid for parochial schools had been used by the opposi tion in “very touchy and emo tional” terms. This was strong ly denied by Mr. Lehner, who said that his initial motive in entering politics was as an antiwar activist who considered Mr. Walsh's record weak on the issue. Mr. O'Rourke, who directed the recanvass, said that the turnabout might have been at tributable to incomplete totals initially in the, military and ab sentee ballots, or to misread ings of the machine figures last Tuesday night. Mr. Lehner said that con trary to the charge of his being beholden to landlords, he of fered aid as a lawyer to tenant groups. “After all that work, to be hit in the final hour by a smear,” he said sadly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Swedish Schools Stress Equality of Sexual Roles,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/10/archives/swedish-schools-stress-equality-of-sexual-roles.html,"STOCKHOLM, Nov. 1—Chil dren in Sweden's rapidly chang ing school system start sex‐edu cation courses at the age of 7. Boys and girls are jointly taught ??ewing and woodwork. Textbooks depict mothers and fathers interchangeably work ing and caring for children. “In our new curriculum this year we have sought to show that men and women have the same possibilities,” said Stig Fred, an adviser to the national board of education who deals with sex and biological pro grams. “We should not try to influence a child's picture of life with books that show men and women in traditional roles.” “Swedish schools have al ways aimed to prepare children as fully as possible for life,” Mr. Fred, a spare, earnest for mer biology teacher, said in his office. “The essential point to our sex program is that we all have responsibility for each other, that parents must respect one another and every baby born must be welcome.” The Task Is Easier “We are able to deal with sex education here because of the smallness of the country— there are fewer people in Swe den than in New York—and be cause our school system is cen trally directed,” he continued. “This cohesive system, with children taking the same pro gram all over Sweden, makes programs such as sex education easier to implement.” The educational system is en gulfed in a series of major sub stantive changes designed to “democratize the schools, send more young men and women to college and provide a broader basic education for the more than 950,000 students. Starting next year, each 16 year‐old will enter a new “gym nasial” school that will combine the programs formerly offered. “We want to do away with the past situation, where the upper class generally went to schools that led to the univer sity while the lower class entered vocational ‐ training schools,” said Anne‐Marie Lind gren, a school specialist at the Ministry of Education and Cul tural Affairs. “That is not democracy,” she added emphatically. “In a de mocracy, as in school, people of all types must work together and one can‘t be regarded as better than a neighbor simply because of intelligence. Chil dren should not be separated. They should learn to live to gether and respect one an other.” University Gain Foreseen The opening of the new two to‐four‐year schools — which will offer everything from train ing for construction work to linguistics, history and general academic subjects — makes a big influx into the universities possible. Education officials predict that by 1975 about 95 per cent of students will get some form of higher education. Nearly 80 per cent of the 16‐to‐18‐year olds do so now. “The question of democracy must be dealt with not only at the higher age levels but also at grade‐school age,” said Ingrid Fredrikkson, a vocational spe cialist at the Education Minis try. “Children now are being taught to respect all occupa tions, manual as well as brain jobs. Children now are being taught together, whether they are weak or strong. “The weaker ones get stim ulated by the good ones. The good ones learn too—they learn that not everyone is the same, that one should have re spect for those with problems and those who may be less intelligent.” In the nine‐year grade‐school system, which is compulsory for those from 7 to 16, the Government has made English obligatory for 10‐year‐olds. Starting this year, more time will be allotted for discussions of “international questions,” drugs, alcohol and sex educa tion as well as sexual roles. Evolving Responsibilities The over‐all question of sex ual roles—and the school sys tem's attempt to eliminate the traditional view that men work while women remain at home —was underscored this year in teacher‐training courses. For the first time discusion focused on the evolving responsibilities of men and women—and how to deal with those responsibili ties—in courses ranging from history and religion to science. “As far as the young gen eration is concerned, one can hope to soften the tradition that some feelings, character istics, interests, behaviors and working assignments are only suitable for men and others only for women,” said Premier Olof Palme, who strongly em phasized equality of the sexes when he was Minister of Edu cation. Swedish children are taught “equality of the sexes” in the family as well as on the labor market. “Our schools will direct girls to have the same expec tations as boys,” Mrs. Fredrikk son said. “Girls will not simply be directed onto the usual paths —the paths of being a typist or secretary or nurse. They can be scientists and engineers too.” Sex education remains a key element of the system. Officials report that in the last few years birth, puberty and sexual relations have been discussed, with an increasing use of films, demonstration sets of contra ceptives and instructive models. Compulsory Since 1955 Mr. Fred said that sex educa tion, which has been compul sory since 1955, starts with 7 year‐olds learning how the sex es differ, how children develop before birth, how they are born and in what ways they are de pendent on their families. At all levels, he added, the subject is treated with “tact, judgment and discretion.” As students grow older, instruc tion concerns structure and function of the sexual organs, menstruation, masturbation and conception. In recent years, medical doc tors, psychologists and mid wives have spoken with stu dents aged 14 to 16 on such subjects as venereal disease, il legitimacy and abortion. “That certain matters con nected with the subject are either shocking or self‐evident has not been a criterion for de ciding whether they should be excluded or included,” Mr. Fred said. “Sex life will probably al ways form an emotion‐filled part of existence. We must never forget our major role, however: to insure that sex ed ucation is objective and to aid a young person in his or her development.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Buckley Mystique,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/12/archives/the-buckley-mystique.html,"Father was a man of almost painful, personal modesty. Respecting his chil dren, alas, he abandoned modesty for a pride that, fore all of us, could be even more painful. He fretted over our moral and intellectual backwardness. At dinner parties, on the other hand, he was certain that his poor guests were hugely entertained by hearing us howl through Mexican ballads, or by listening to me, age 7, Charge Through the tight Brigade. We like to died. At the age of 8, I finally put a stop to calls for my recitation by whipping out a toy but lethal–looking metal sword and, with wild histrionic thrusts, brandishing it at Cossack to the‐right‐of‐me and Cossack to‐the left‐of‐me, nearly slicing the choker chain off one venerable lady and all but decapitating her husband. Checked, but never daunted, father persisted in embarrassing us right down to the toenails, even when we were adolescents, grasping our upper arms in his freckled rancher's grip, and propelling us into the breast or bosom of startled visitors, proclaiming our most recent accomplishments, say a B in Math. He would beam on us those round, pale–blue eyes, magnified by his pince–nez into exophthalmic infractions of a delight perfect in its assumption that we were wonderful. We revered him; and reciprocated his with our love; and were painfully conscious that our accomplishments did not approximat?? our father's boundless fantasies. I think we have all been moderately possessed by the compulsion to make good on our father's (and mother's) enormous (and undeserved) pride. This has stung us into working harder than some people, if not as hard as a good many others. And it has caused us to shrink—with the same childhood embarrassment—from the limelight, something frequently observed about Jim during the campaign, less often about Bill, except by those who know him well Priscilla, who is managing editor of National Review, once trav eled especially to France in order to avoid an (otherwise unavoidable) speaking engagement. Aloise (the most talented) could not bring herself to stand up and ask a question at public meeting. Patricia, managing edi tor of Triumph, had to dress in a red beret before brandishing the courage to demonstrate against the abortion laws. I doubt any, of us enjoys it, which may be why so many of us have hid den behind the metal arras of the typewriter. Professionally, Bill has been soaked in klieg light. There ??ur vives in him, nevertheless, the self deprecatory spirit that, often by sleight of wit, objectifies the public personality—he doesn't allow himself to be confused with those who sell themselves into believing in their own myth. The status of celebrity, as dis tinguished from the obligations there of, Bill treats as frolic, hoping you won't be so undiscriminating as to take it too solemnly either. And so with Jim, different as he is: tempera. mental humility that made campaign ing an agony, until the cause began to carry him. We find it difficult to blow our own trumpet, to pose as charismatic lead ers, to feel that self–assurance that permits others to believe in their indis pensability to the world at large. We are, therefore, happier as advocates of someone else (a sibling will do); of, particularly, an intellectual or mor al idea. It required the flush of triumph, the euphoria of election night, for Jim to pronounce that “there is a new Con servative politics, and I am the voice of that politics.” (Bill quipped the next morning: “Who in the hell does Jim think he is? La politique nouvelle, c'est goddam well moi!”) I am confi dent that Jim was flushing with mortal embarrassment the next morning; even though the proposition may, in a way, be true. Jim's instant rapport with the peo ple he met during the campaign is different in mode, but cognate never theless. Here was another paladin of conservative thought, a brother of William; and in his stammering, whol ly unpretentious manner, as bard to pinstripe: His simplicity is evident. Compared to Bill, Jim can seem stodgy. Bill having cut a path through the jungle with his machete, Jim didn't need to conceal his sweetness of na ture. There's charm when he invokes even the “eternal verities” and in those words without a stylistic shud der—plainly because he believes in them. Bill and Jim are as different as two peas in a pod; as different as brothers can be in their expression of a shared philosophical context, and in whom that essential is evident. If there is a “Buckley mystique,” it is imbedded there in the abiding rec ognition of our moral and intellectual deficiencies measured against the goal of perfection. We learned from our parents to prefer the good man to the brilliant man. It is a sacred humanity in people we respect. Our compassion is earned in the equality of the human condition. People are surprised to real ize that we, princelings of Dame For tune as they may feel us to be, tread the same hard interior landscape. And it may be this that comes through, that fascinates, because we do not presume, “Come, let us lead you,” but, instead, petition, “Come, our philosophy is your way, the hu man way, and it is you who will and must lead yourselves.” We are not, God help us, Saviors. We remind people that this is their sweet burden, the dread price of their status as human beings endowed with a free will. And we are forever letting them know that we believe in their God–given capacity for shouldering that burden. We therefore reflect the higher estimation for the self that every man may aspire to: his ??ulfill ment as a moral being. And that is an ennobling philosophy, to which everyone can be attracted: that we are all aristocrats in the pri vete domains of the soul, Asked to describe “the Buckley mystique,” the family assigned the task to F.

Amalrik Says Soviet Fears Ideas,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/15/archives/amalrik-says-soviet-fears-ideas-regimes-cowardice-reflected-by.html,"MOSCOW, Nov. 14 — Andrei Amalrik, the dissident Soviet author, was reported today to have told a court that his trial on charges of defaming the So viet state reflected “the cow ardice of a regime that regards as a danger the spreading of any thought, any idea alien to its top bureaucrats.”  The Sverdlovsk court, in a two‐day trial that ended on Thursday, sentenced Mr. Amal rik, 32‐year‐old author of sever al books and essays published abroad, to three years' confine ment in a labor camp. A co‐de fendant, Lev. G. Ubozhko, a Sverdlovsk student, also re ceived three years but in a less strict camp. Mr. Amalrik's friends related his remarks to Western news men. They said the verdict would be appealed. In his final words before being sentenced, Mr. Amalrik said his trial was meant to frighten others into silence, but “I think that the process of ideological emancipation that has begun is irreversible.” Mr. Amalrik, a slightly built, bespectacled historian, made it a point to know many for eigners before his arrest last May at his summer cottage in Ryazan Province, southeast of Moscow. His wife, Guyzel, a painter, attended the trial as a witness. According to his friends, Mr. Amalrik looked in good health despite the six months' confine ment, and he seemed as out spokenly critical of the Soviet leadership as in his works. His book “Will the U.S.S.R. Survive Until 1984” predicts the down fall of the Soviet regime be cause of internal disorders and a war with China. Mr. Amalrik compared the trials of dissidents to witch trials of the Middle Ages. “But if one could at least partly explain the struggle against heretic ideas in the Mid dle Ages as religious fanati cism,” he told the three‐man tribunal, “everything taking on Taiwan have had abortions, place now can be explained Appears in Good Health only as the cowardice of a re gime that regards as a danger the spreading of any thought, any idea alien to its top bu reaucrats.” Although the Soviet authori ties talk about an ideological struggle, he said, they can op pose alien ideas only with “the threat of criminal prosecution.” “Recognizing their ideological hopelessness, they cling in fear to criminal codes, prisons, camps and psychiatric hospi tals,” he said. “In particular, the fear of my thoughts, of the facts expressed in my books, forces these peo ple to put me in the dock as a criminal. This fear led them also to be afraid of trying me in Moscow. They brought me here, thinking that here the trial would attract less attention.” The Amalriks are legally reg istered as living in Moscow, where they share a communal apartment. Sverdlovsk, in the Urals, is off limits to foreigners. Mr. Amalrik was notified that he was being tried in Sverd lovsk on the ground that copies of his works were found in that Urals city. Mr. Amalrik and Mr. Ubozhko were tried under Article 190 (1) of the Russian Republic's Crim inal Code, which makes it a Code Amended in 1966 crime to spread “deliberate fab rications defaming the Soviet state and public order.” The article was added in 1966 and is used against dissidents. In addition to his books, pub lished only abroad, Mr. Amal rik was also cited for inter views he gave to William Cole, a correspondent of the Colum bia Broadcasting System who was subsequently expelled from Moscow. Mr. Amalrik refused to enter a plea of guilty or not guilty, insisting that the court had no right to try him for his views. He repeated his refusal to discuss his views in his final statement, but said he did wish to answer the allegations that his statements “were directed against my people and my country.” “It seems to me that now the main task for my country is to unburden itself of the heavy weight of the past, and for this criticism is necessary above all and not glorification,” he said. “I think that I am a better patriot than those who, loudly declaring their love for the motherland, by love for the motherland mean love for their own privileges. “Neither the witch‐hunt carried out by the regime, nor this particular example—this trial—arouses in me the slight est respect nor any fear. I un derstand, however, that such trials are counted on to fright en many, and many will be frightened. But all the same, I think, the development of ideo logical emancipation, having begun, is irreversible.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Minnesota Gynecologist, a Mother, Risks Her Career to Test State's Abortion Law",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/15/archives/minnesota-gynecologist-a-mother-risks-her-career-to-test-states.html,"ST. PAUL, Nov. 14—“I was beginning to feel like a criminal anyway,” Dr. Jane Hodgson said.  “I've always had a proper respect for the law, and I've performed very few of even the so‐called ‘legal’ abortions—not over a dozen in 23 years of practice. But they aren't the ones that bother me. It's the ones I've refused to perform that haunt me.” Dr. Hodgson is a prominent and highly respected St. Paul gynecologist and obstetrician, a University of Minnesota pro fessor, the mother of two daughters and the wife of a successful cardiac surgeon. She went on trial this week in the first direct test of Minnesota's 84‐year‐old abortion law. It is a trial in which the defense is more eager for a conviction than the prosecution. “No one really wants to con vict me or send me to jail,” Dr. Hodgson said in an inter view. “But I want a convic tion. Because if we don't get one, they will let all this drop again, and every day that drags on means that much more un happiness for a lot of women who shouldn't be forced to have babies they don't want.” Dr. Hodgson, a striking blonde whose figure and color ing belie her age (55 years), has been guaranteed a trial recess on demand. District Judge J. Jerome Plunkett agreed that with at least a dozen of her patients nearing labor, Dr. Hodgson should be allowed to leave the trial whenever the bleeper radio she carries in her purse indicated she was needed at the hospital. A member of the abortion committee of the Minnesota State Medical Society and chairman of Planned Parenthood's medical advisory com mittee in Minnesota, Dr. Hodg son tried earlier this year to make a constitutional challenge of the state's abortion law in Federal court. But a three‐judge panel de clined to rule on her appeal that the statute, which permits abortions only when a mother's life is in danger, was unconsti tutional because it denied a woman's right to privacy. The Federal judges decided that they did not have jurisdiction because there was no “jus tifiable controversy.” So, on April 29, Dr. Hodgson performed an abortion on Mrs. Nancy Kay Widmyer, the 24‐ year‐old wife of a construction worker. Mrs. Widmyer, a mother of three small children, suffered rubella (German measles) dur ing the first weeks of her pregnancy. “There was a 60 per cent chance that Nancy's child would be born deformed, and neither she nor I wanted to take that risk,” Dr. Hodgson said. “I could have sent her to New York or Mexico or Montreal. She had the funds to go. Or I could have quietly performed the abortion here and nobody would have said anything.” Instead, Dr. Hodgson notified the St. Paul police that she had performed an illegal operation and invited them to arrest her, setting up a direct test of the criminal law. According to Roy Lucas, who was sent here by the James Madison Constitutional Law In stitute to serve as chief counsel for the doctor, there are at least 70 other challenges of state abortion laws pending. Dr. Hodgson said that last year, the medical society's abortion committee recom Performs an Abortion Other Challenges mended repeal of the Minnesota abortion law. But when a re peal bill was finally reported out of committee last winter, the state legislature did not even vote on it. “This is something that has been growing on me and grow ing on me,” the doctor said. “Hardly a day goes by that I don't see a case of unwanted pregnancy. I've seen the teen agers come in to beg for help and I know most of the ones who can't afford to go away are going to go to a criminal abortionist here. Then they often come back to me with infections or damage and we are helpless again. “I was really in a unique and ideal position to be the one to make the challenge,” she went on. “First, being a woman, I think I understand better the real meaning of an unwanted pregnancy. Then too, I could afford to quit practicing medi cine if I have to. My husband can support me and my chil dren quite well if I lose my license. And I've had a lovely, fortunate life up until now, and I'm better prepared emo tionally for the criticism that has already come from some of the people I know.” Neither Dr. Hodgson nor her attorneys believe there is much chance she will go to jail, even though the lawyers are certain she will be found guilty. But it was not clear whether she would automatically lose her license on conviction or whether the medical governing board would waive revocation while the conviction was appealed. “My biggest worry right now is that because of the rubella exposure the court may decide that the abortion was justified,” she said. “If that happens, we couldn't appeal to the United Jail Term Unlikely States Supreme Court and get the law declared unconstitu tional.” Dr. Hodgson, the daughter of a small‐town physician in northwest Minnesota, said she be lieved it was time the medical profession made a fight for abortion reform in Minnesota. “The doctors here have failed and ducked on a question they know involves good medical practice,” she said. “It's always been the laymen who won the reforms.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HOUSE VOTES AID TO BIRTH CONTROL,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/17/archives/house-votes-aid-to-birth-control-provides-service-to-poor-nixon-may.html,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 16—The House voted today to provide birth control services for all American women who cannot afford them.  The far‐reaching bill, once viewed as politically taboo, cleared the House with surpris ingly little dissent by a vote of 298 to 32. Similar legislation, carrying a larger price tag, was passed by the Senate last summer. Once the Senate and House differ ences are settled in conference as expected, the measure will go to the White House, pos sibly within a few weeks. Under both versions, family planning services would be made available to all American women who want them, but are unable to afford them. These would include birth control pills and other means of con traception, as well as consul tations, examinations and in struction. It has been estimated that about five million American wo men of child‐bearing age need family planning services. Both the Senate and House bills would also provide Fed eral aid for birth control re search and would establish an Office of Population Affairs within the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. For more than 20 years, Dem ocratic and Republican Presi dents have suggested the need for Federal involvement in fam ily planning. However, largely because of strong Roman Cath olic opposition within Congress, the subject was largely skirted. Earlier Breakthrough Two years ago a limited breakthrough came when Con gress voted to provide funds for family planning services as part of a pending antipoverty bill. This was done quietly, with even many members of Con gress unaware of the import of that amendment, sponsored by Representative James H. Scheuer, Democrat of the Bronx. The far broader bill that has now been passed by both hous es was vigorously supported by the Nixon Administration. The President viewed the leg islation as one of his top goals. The Senate version would authorize $991.2‐million over the next five years.The House scaled this down to a three‐ year program costing $267‐ million. The House bill would ban use of Federal funds for any program involving abortion as a method of family planning.

BISHOPS HAIL TIES WITH JEWS IN U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/19/archives/bishops-hail-ties-with-jews-in-us-collaboration-described-as.html,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 18 — Relations between Roman Ca tholics and Jews in the United States in the last five years have reached a point of under standing and collaboration “the equal of which has never been witnessed before in Christian history.”  This was the judgment of the Secretariat for Catholic‐ Jewish Relations of the Com mittee for Ecumenical and In terreligious Affairs of the Na tional Conference of Catholic Bishops. The conference is meeting here at the Washington Hilton Hotel. The secretariat report noted that returned questionnaires had shown that about 35 dio ceses had some official arrange ment to deal with Catholic‐ Jewish relations, and some others do so on an informal basis. It cited as particularly ac tive the dioceses of Brooklyn, Albany, Atlanta, Baltimore, Bos ton, Rockville Centre, L.I., Philadelphia, Detroit and Gal veston‐Houston. “For the first time in our history relations between Jews and Christians, the church and synagogue, approach the nor mal, with Christians and Jews approaching each other in full respect and brotherly love and in dialogue,” the report said. “It is with gratification that we note that in this first flow ering, the church in the United States has performed with dis tinction.” The report also noted that extensive guidelines on such re lations published jointly by the Brooklyn and Rockville Centre Dioceses had attracted atten tion in Europe as well as in America. Yet, the report warned, “se rious obstacles still lie in our path.” It cited the following: ¶A “low‐toned and uncon scious,” but still widespread, anti‐Semitism. ¶The failure of Catholic schol ars to explore sufficiently the place of Judaism in Christian theology, although the Second Vatican Council “illumined the way” with its rejection of Jew ish guilt in the death of Jesus. ¶The state of Israel as a seri ous stumbling block in Jewish Christian relations. The report said that many Jews who identify with Israel as a refuge from anti‐Semitism, a new source of identity and survival, or as a messianic ful fillment, had deemed Christian silence during the six‐day war in 1967 as indifference to the possibility of another genocide, and had expressed their disap pointment. Dr. Joseph Lichten, national director of intercultural affairs of the Anti‐Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, called the re port “impressive” and a major step toward increasingly im proved relations. Dr. Lichten an accredited ob server at the meeting, said, “The particular importance Of the report is in the recogni tion of the fact that anti‐ Semitism, though ‘low‐toned,’ is still widespread and that zion ism should receive ‘an ecumeni cal and religious consideration in the Catholic‐Jewish dia logue.” This morning the Bishops overwhelmingly approved a “declaration” reaffirming the church's opposition to abortion. In another action, the bishops recognized the validity of the marriage of a Catholic and a enon‐Catholic when performed by a clergyman of another faith, or in some instances, by a civil authority.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

325 Frenchwomen Convene at Versailles to Improve Their Status in Society,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/21/archives/325-frenchwomen-convene-at-versailles-to-improve-their-status-in.html,"VERSAILLES, France, Nov. 20 — Some 325 delegates, a cross section of French Wom anhood, are meeting here to see what they can do to im prove their status in society. The session, called the States General of Womanhood — re calling the congress in 1789 that led to the French Revolu tion — is in a convention hall next to the great royal palace that a revolutionary mob in vaded 181 years ago. But none of the delegates today ap peared to be in a revolution ary mood. There is a small women's lib eration movement, allied with extremist New Left groups, and some of its militants had been threatening to upset the pro ceedings. One of their objec tions was that men were par ticipating. Man In the Chair The first speaker today, in fact, was Premier Jacques cha ban‐Delmas, who said he liked to work with women and was applauded for it. He told the delegates that the Government was striving for women's equality with men but added that trying to make them identical was “stupid and disastrous.” He said women constituted a third of French workers but could not carry on exactly the same professional life as men because they had a responsibility for children. In the chair there also was a man, Jean Mauduit, head of the group that publishes Elle, the most widely read French woman's magazine and the sponsor of the states‐general. Mr. Mauduit was helped in keeping things running by his two assistants, Agnes Constan tin and Martine Sussfeld, who did most of the organizational work beforehand. A nationwide poll of women's opinion that helped prepare the states‐general indicated that most women thought there had been progress in their daily existence and in their relations with men but that there was room for improvement. Most of those who spoke today talked of reform rather than revolu tionary change. Love and sexual relations captured most of the interest, although the delegates also had under consideration the prob lems of culture, education, hous ing, politics, information and work. The commission on love, the couple and marriage also pro duced the most heated debates. There was general agreement that premarital relations were increasing in France, but older women took a dim view of the situation. One, a mother of five, said that “a lover is only for physi cal pleasure” and others said that he should be reserved only for women aged 30 and up. At 20, they asserted, a girl does not have sufficient ma turity, still others disagreed, saying she should not be de prived of the right. The poll had indicated that 55 per cent of Frenchwomen thought it was all right for a girl to have premarital rela tions; 91 per cent were in favor of such relations for, men. A majority favored less strict abortion laws; a third wanted abortion to be allowed when woman desired it and a third only in gravae circumstances while a third were against abortion altogether. Family planning also re ceived general favor despite Govertunent campaign to in crease the birth rate. Ali the women said they were in favor of sex education in the ele mentary schools. The other major subject to day was access to culture, and the consensus was that it wes a general problem, with women suffering a little more than men. Statistics were cited to the effect that 57 per cent of the population had never read a book and 78 per cent had never been in a concert hall. Jean‐Francios Khan, a jour nalist and radio commentataor, got cheers when he described the predicament of a woman who rises at 5:30 A.M., rushes to get her child to a care cen ter, takes an hour and half to get to work and does the same in the reverse in the evening. “You can't expect her to read or listen to classical music after that,” he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LAW ON ABORTION IS UPHELD IN TEST,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/21/archives/law-on-abortion-is-upheld-in-test-woman-doctor-in-minnesota-gets.html,"ST. PAUL, Minn., Nov. 20—A St. Paul judge upheld today as constitutional the Minnesota abortion law, then gave a woman gynecologist a suspend ed sentence for violating it. Judge J. Jerome Plunkett of Ramsey County District Court praised the defendant, Dr. Jane Hodgson, for her “forthright ness and courage” in testing the 87‐year‐old statute, which permits abortion only to save the life of the mother. Dr. Hodgson admitted per forming an abortion last April on a woman who had contract ed German measles (rubella) early in her pregnancy. The illness increases the risk that a baby will be born deformed. Judge Plunkett also refused to certify the case to the State Supreme Court as “important and doubtful,” as he had been asked to do by Roy Lucas, a New York lawyer who repre sented Dr. Hodgson. The judge said an appeal of Dr. Hodgson's conviction would raise the same issues as certification. The defense has said it intended to appeal. Dr. Hodgson, 55 years old, was convicted Thursday of vio lating the law and today, after ruling on the constitutional question, Judge Plunkett sen tenced her to 30 days in jail but suspended the sentence pending the outcome of the appeal. “It has not been an easy po sition for you to take on this matter,” Judge Plunkett told Dr. Hodgson. “But you can take solace from the esteem your colleagues have held you in. You know as a professional person that the court has had to make a difficult decision. Yours was more difficult.” Another defense attorney, Stewart Perry of St. Paul, said any action on possible revoca tion of Dr. Hodgson's license would have to be taken by the State Board of Medical Ex aminers. Should the board try to revoke the license, he would go to court for relief, he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pro: He's a nice guy. Con: Nice guys don't necessarily make good Presidents.,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/22/archives/prohes-a-nice-guy-connice-guys-dont-necessarily-make-good.html,"CAST a cold eye an the life of any politician and with luck you'll come across an Exemp lary Anecdote. An Exemplary Anec dote is one that concisely and dra matically reveals an important aspect of the politician's nature and, journal ism being a form of shorthand as well as a form of entertainment, a re porter rejoices to find it. In the case of Senator Edmund Sixtus Muskie, who as Hubert Humphrey's running mate in 1968 won the most favorable press coverage of any Vice‐Presiden tial candidate in our history, the Exemplary Anecdote goes like this: On Jan. 7, 1959, tne opening day of Congress, a friend took Mus kie, the newly elected Senator from Maine, to meet Lyndon Baines John son, the majority leader of the Sen ate. L.B.J. was cordial and delivered a homily on the difficulties that freshmen Senators had to face. There were so many issues with so many political implications and so many roll‐call votes coming up on the floor, Johnson told Muskie, that “there will be times when you won't know how you're going to vote un til the clerk gets to the M's.” A few minutes later, the avuncular L.B.J. gave way to the manipulative L.B.J. The first piece of business before the Senate was Rule XXII, the so‐called filibuster rule, which at that time permitted unlimited debate un less two‐thirds of all the Senators voted for closure. It was Johnson's proposal to change Rule XXII in a token way; according to his plan, two‐thirds of the Senators present and voting would be able to shut off debate. A number of liberal Senators, led by Paul Douglas of Illinois, were supporting a proposal to permit closure by a simple majority vote. L.B.J. talked to Muskie half an hour about Rule XXII in general and the merits of his proposal in partic ular. Muskie believed that the change Johnson supported was inadequate and had already decided to vote for the Douglas proposal. The discretion is‐the‐better‐part‐of‐valor silence he maintained proved unacceptable to the majority leader, who finally com mented, “Well, Ed, you haven't had much to say.” Muskie realized that L.B.J. was challenging him to take a stand, so he answered in what he thought was the gentlest way of tell ing Johnson he couldn't go along with his proposal by saying, “Well, Lyndon, they haven't gotten to the M's yet.” L.B.J. had purposely delayed hand ing out committee assignments to the freshman Democratic Senators until after the vote on Rule XXII; he rewarded Muskie's impertinence with dismal committee assignments. Freshmen Senators, who are assigned to two or three committees, are asked to submit a list of the six committees they would prefer to serve on. The junior Senator from Maine got his fourth choice (Banking and Currency) and two even drearier committees that weren't on his list at all, Public Works and Government Operations. Senator Muskie's admirers tell the Exemplary Anecdote reverent ly, reciting the “They haven't got ten to the M's” line in much the same tone schoolteachers have long used for the “I did it with my little hatchet” line in the George Wash ington legend. They claim it is Pro: He's Mr. Clean. Con: But he's not Mr. Civil Rights. Pro: He is moderate, cool and educable. Con: He lacks pizzazz, savvy and chutzpa. Pro: He's a Horatio Alger hero. Con: Horatio Alger heroes are from Dullsville. Muskie's good character that came across to the public during his quest for the Vice Presidency in 1968 and turned him from an obscure Senator into the Cinderella of the campaign. Senator Muskie's nonadmirers, who include a segment of the Noisy Minority — the intellectual elite, the Eastern Liberal Media Estab lishment, the left wing of the Democratic party—make short shrift of Muskie's '68 success. They believe it was a success based on compari son: Muskie looked so good because the other candidates were so bad. “In the kingdom of the blind, the one eyed man is king,” a Harvard pro fessor put it. (In the kingdom of the Harvard professor, exaggeration al ways puts the point across.) Muskie, who quietly preached a message of compassion and tolerance, was more appealing than the mechanistic Nixon, the blundering (“If you've seen one city slum, you've seen them all”) Ag new, the racist Wallace, and the panglossian Humphrey, but the liber als had serious doubts about him. At the top of the tree of doubts was the fact that he had led the speakers for Lyndon Johnson's plank —also known as the hawks’ plank or the majority plank on Vietnam—at the Democratic convention in Chi cago. The majority plank made the cessation of the bombing of North Vietnam contingent upon a recipro cal military response from Hanoi, the position L.B.J. had taken at the time. The minority (or doves) called for an unconditional halt to the bombing of North Vietnam. Senator Muskie's position became particularly puzzling when it was revealed dur ing the course of the campaign that in January, 1968, seven months be fore the convention, he had written a private letter to President Johnson advising him to halt the bombing of North Vietnam unconditionally. There was also the matter of his unsexy Senatorial career. Most Sen ators move onto the more glamorous committees as they acquire the seni ority to do so; Muskie still serves on the three committees to which L.B.J. banished him in 1959. In 1965, when he was offered a spot on the Foreign Relations Committee, his first choice back in 1959, he turned it down be cause he was involved in projects on his other committees. Muskie's voting record was liberal enough to please the liberals—his A.D.A. record over the last 12 years averages 87 per cent—but they felt he had displayed real leadership only on such relatively uncontroversial issues as pollution. As the sponsor of most of the Federal antipollution bills passed since 1963, Muskie was “Mr. Clean,” his critics agreed, but he wasn't “Mr. Civil Rights” or “Mr. Curb the Military.” “Why is it that some people are always so much more concerned with what you're not than with what you are?” Senator Muskie mused recently. MUSICIE'S critics become exas perated when his friends tell them, as they so often do, what a Nice Guy he is. Some of them think that character and issues are inseparable and that a Nice Guy doesn't oppose the bombing of North Vietnam pri vately and then support it publicly seven months later. The others don't regard niceness as essential to win ning the Presidency. “Are Lyndon Johnson or Richard Nixon Nice Guys?” they ask rhetorically. Nor do they think that Nice Guys necessarily make good Presidents. Muskie's crit ics are convinced that Dwight D. Ei senhower was a Nice Guy and a mediocre President and that Franklin D. Roosevelt was a so‐and‐so and an outstanding President. Then, too Muskie's niceness and the other old fashioned virtues attributed to him like moderation and thrift, are not the qualities that attract his critics, who prefer the chic virtues that Muskie lacks: pizzazz, savvy and chutzpa To them, Muskie is a Horatio Alge hero and Horatio Alger heroes are from Dullsville. UPWARDLY MOBILE MUSKIE. If there ever is an “official” campaign portrait of Edmund Sixtus Muskie, it might look a lot like the recent photo at left, in which he manages to look both statesmanlike and just plain Maine as he chews on his eyeglasses. His ability to project well made Muskie one of the outstanding Vice‐Presidential candidates in U. S. history in his '68 campaign with H.H.H., above. But he went into eclipse with Humphrey after '68, and virtually conceded ‘72 to Senator Ted Kennedy, fop—until Chappaquid dick. Since then Muskies hopes have been soaring with his poll ratings; and he has (1) organized a team of ex perts “for the education of Ed Muskie” in the higher things, and (2) become more of a strider on the national scene; e.g., above right, he leads a group including Senator Charles Percy of Illinois and Averell Harriman to Jackson State College, Miss., after the fatal shootings in May. Youths are, center, student Adrian Peterson and, left, student president Warner Buxton. When Muskie's supporters and de tractors evaluate his political record and style, their statements serve as a reminder that the same bottle can always be perceived as half full or half empty. Pro‐Muskie people see his political career as a string of superlatives and escalating percentages. In 1954, in Yankee rock ‐ribbed Republican Maine, Muskie became the first Cath olic Governor ever elected in the state, the first Polish‐American Gov ernor ever elected in the country, and the first Democrat elected Governor of Maine in 20 years. Muskie was re elected Governor in 1956, increasing his winning percentage from 1954's 54.5 per cent to 59.1 per cent. In 1958, Muskie became Maine's first popularly elected Democratic Sena tor, with 60.6 per cent of the vote; he was re‐elected in 1964 with 66.6 per cent. He has just won re‐election to a third term with 62 cent. The anti‐Muskie group (and I am dwelling on them for the reason Spiro Agnew does — their opinion‐making power is formidable) think of Maine as a hick state that is justly cele brated for lobsters, potatoes, and summer holidays, but not for pro ducing Presidential candidates. Suc cess in Maine politics, they claim, is to success in California or New York politics what minor‐league baseball is to major‐league baseball. When pro‐Muskie people boast that Muskie has made no enemies, anti Muskie people reply that great lead ers make powerful enemies and that a man is known by the shadow he casts. The day after the '68 election, Muskie partisans were already sug gesting that Muskie ought to head the ticket in '72. His critics adopted a wait‐and‐see attitude. He was the political Cinderella of '68 but that didn't mean he would get the glass slipper in '72. Four years in politics is a lifetime, sometimes two. NO matter how Muskie's '68 per formance is regarded, one fact is indisputable: it was meteoric. On Sept. 8, 1968, shortly after Muskie got the Democratic Vice‐Presidential nomination, a Baltimore Sun reporter wrote, “He brings so little glitter to the ticket that it is easy to believe Vice President Humphrey's claim that Senator Muskie was chosen because he is the best qualified of all the available men to take over the office of the Presidency ‘in the event'....” By the end of the month, the coun try's political columnists were smitten by Humphrey's running mate and their columns read like mash The headline on the one James Reston wrote on Sept. 28 was, “When in doubt, vote for Muskie!” According to his friends, Muskie was “overwhelmed” by the unex pected transmogrification from Pine Tree State Senator to national celeb rity and finished the campaign with his spirits “as high as a kite.” Per haps that is why the events of the next six months — from December, 1968, to June, 1969—were such a cruel comedown. That December, Muskie decided against challenging Senator Russell Long, the incumbent majority whip, for his post, a stepping stone to the majority leadership, which had been deemed Muskie's ultimate political destiny until '68. (In August, 1967, a competent political reporter wrote in The Atlantic, “Edmund Muskie will never be President.”) As a result of the national campaign, Muskie for the first time felt “the faint stirrings of Presidential ambition.” In his opin ion, the majority whip job would tie him down to the Senate floor and he wanted to be free to travel around the country to court a national con stituency. A few weeks later, Sen ator Edward M. Kennedy ran for ma jority whip and beat Senator Long. In late January, 1969, Senator Muskie flew off to Texas to give a pair of speeches and to attend two political dinners. Over the next five months, he flitted around the coun try giving dozens of speeches in dozens of states. The travels were discouraging. Before 1968, Muskie's main complaint was that no one ever paid any attention to him, which he attributed to his quiet style. Dur ing the campaign, he thrived on the automatic visibility a Vice‐Presiden tial candidate receives. As he has said a thousand times, “I felt un leashed! liberated! during that cam paign. I could say what I really thought and felt without straining or shouting, and still be listened to. That felt damned good.” After the campaign, he was being ignored again by the national press and he resented it mightily. In the spring of 1969, when a reporter in Maine asked him a question, he shouted at him, “For God's sake, don't you realize I just answered that The polls were even more dis heartening than the fickle national press. Muskie was in constant mo tion but Teddy was by far the favor ite choice of those queried to lead the Democratic party in '72. Muskie dis played the Kennedy complex that has afflicted almost all the men who have run against—or thought they would have to run against—the Kennedy brothers in the last decade. When Teddy became majority whip and Muskie set off to seek the national exposure he acknowledged Teddy “didn't need,” Teddy's face graced the covers of Time and Newsweek “If I had won the whip's job, I wouldn't have gotten the attention Kennedy did,” Muskie remarked. “I can't recall a man ever getting on the cover of two national magazines by being elected whip.” He also observed that he was “glad to discover that a poor boy can become President of this country if he can pick up twenty million dollars for expenses on the way.” On June 30, 1969, Muskie an nounced that “unless there is some pretty substantial change in the po litical climate,” he believed Teddy would win the 1972 Democratic Pres idential nomination. “I can get along without being President,” he added, and one couldn't help thinking of the fox announcing his conclusion that the grapes beyond his reach were sour. The “pretty substantial change” occurred on Chappaquiddick Island the night of July 18, 1969. Thirteen days later, Teddy declared himself out of the running for the 1972 Pres idential sweepstakes. By fall, the polls showed that Muskie was the front runner for the Democratic nomina tion in '72 and he has been the front runner ever since. To those who thought Muskie was a hero by com parison in '68 he seemed a front‐run ner by default in '69. IN August, 1969, Senator Muskie conceded that an obstacle to his can didacy was that he hadn't demon strated forceful leadership in the major controversies of the day. He was going to do something about this, however. He was cutting back his “frenetic” speaking schedule of recent months and assembling a team of experts to “educate him on foreign and domestic issues for a possible candidacy.” The experts who have been contributing to what the Sen ator likes to call “the education of Ed Muskie” include such alumni of recent Democratic Administrations as Averell Harriman, Walter Heller, Sol Linowitz, Arthur Okun, Jack Valenti and Cyrus Vance. The four men considered Muskie's most im portant advisers are Clark Clifford,, the former Secretary of Defense; Paul Warnke, a former Assistant Sec retary of Defense; Harry McPherson, a speechwriter for L.B.J. and Beri Bernhard, staff director of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission during the One result of Muskie's leave‐the driving‐to‐them Senatorial perform ance was that the bright, ambitious young men who go to work for Sen ators who look as if they have a chance to reach the White House did not seek jobs on Muskie's staff. The academicians, the lawyers and the writers who can provide candidates with speeches, research and advice didn't find Muskie worth bothering with before 1968, either. Muskie's staff has been described by one stu dent of Congressional staffs as “a nice, courteous group of Mainers, just like their boss. But also like the boss in being a little lazy, a little too cau tious and conventional, a little too easily overwhelmed by difficulty. They're not go‐getters and they share Muskie's poor‐boy mentality.” The staff was deemed adequate for the junior Senator from Maine, but its deficiencies became apparent in early '69 when Muskie set out on his public‐exposure tour to test the political winds for '72. The newly ac quired experts, especially the foreign policy experts, might serve a useful purpose to a man who admits that he knew very little about foreign policy until recently. CHANGE is a favorite theme in political writing. When Candidate X has been examined by the press and the public and found wanting, his aides are inclined to offer a new model of Candidate X. The “old” Nixon came a cropper, so a “new” Nixon was introduced. The press usu ally makes this regenerative process a joint venture because a politician who stays the same for any length of time becomes dull copy; what better peg for a story than one who changes? In the spring of 1970, Muskie aides let it be known that a bolder Muskie had replaced the cautious, ignored by‐the‐press Muskie. Their three fa vorite examples of the new Muskie were a speech he gave on Oct. 22, 1969, in which he proposed that the United States slow down the nuclear arms race by declaring a unilateral six‐month moratorium on the testing of MIRV's; a speech on March 5, 1970, at Washington's National Press Club, in which he charged that the Nixon Administration's Vietnam pol icies could not bring peace and ac cused the Administration of intimidat ing the news media that were critical of the war's conduct; and his trip to Jackson, Miss., last May 22, when he chartered a plane and led a bi partisan group of Congressmen, civil rights leaders, students and others to the funeral of one of the two young blacks who had been killed by white policemen on the Jackson State Col‐ lege campus. SINCE his aides’ favorite example of the new Muskie is the National Press Club speech, it is worth exam ining in detail. The first point of in terest is that the speech was written by one of Senator Muskie's new ad visers. It is better written and strong  “According to friends, Mashie was ‘overwhelmed’ by the unexpected transmogrification from Pine State Senator to national celebrity.” er than Muskie's staff‐written speeches. The press club speech con tains lines like, “What the President keeps referring to as Iris ‘silent ma jority’ may well be the product of too silent a press.” The staff‐written speeches still contain clichés like “the ?? and minds of the people of America.” When the new adviser turned in the speech, Muskie and his staff looked at his schedule and decided he could give it at a small Mid western college. The new adviser was appalled. Giving it there would help assure the speech's being ignored, he said, and suggested that the prop er place to attack the press and White House press policy was the National Press Club. Muskie and his staff said that they doubted they could get the National Press Club on short notice. The new adviser was re‐appalled. He informed the staff that Muskie was, after all, the Dem ocratic front‐runner and certainly they could get the press club. They did. The speech received extensive na tional newspaper coverage and one syndicated columnist saw it as proof of Muskie's “determination to get out front and lead the It would seem that the National Press Club speech shows the differ ence one good adviser can make, rather than the existence of a new Muskie. It would also seem that when Muskie's recent record is stud ied, the three examples his aides cite belong in the exceptions‐that‐prove the‐rule category. For every anti‐MIRV speech Muskie has given, he has given quite a few that read more like civics lessons or Sunday sermons—speeches about the need for America to build an “open society,” etc. The Jackson trip was a one‐of‐a‐kind occurrence. And. al though Muskie did use the National Press Club to attack the press, he does not seem to have any particular zest for confrontation. When an ad viser suggested that he speak to an American Legion audience about Vietnam, the suggestion was rejected. And although Muskie attributes the fact that he doesn't get into the newspapers as much as some other politicians to his lack of flamboy ance, this doesn't seem to make him any readier to make flamboyant statements. This September, Muskie flew to California to speak on behalf of John Tunney in his Senate contest “In the spring of 1969. Muskie was in temporary eclipse, and he resented it. When a reporter is Maine asked him a question. Muskie shouted at him: ‘For God's sake, don't you know I answered that yesterday in Chicago?’” with George Murphy. Muskie could have made headlines by attacking Murphy, but when reporters asked him if he was against Murphy he said no, he was for Tunney. There were no headlines in that. This summer I saw the original draft of a magazine article on Viet nam that had just been published under Senator Muskie's byline. In the draft there was a line which read, “Me ultimate logic of the President's policies makes perpetual war the pre condition for peace.” In the published version, the line had been softened to read, “No matter what its aims, the net effect of the President's pol icy is to perpetuate the war.” When I asked Muskie why he had changed the statement, he first went into a tirade about how he wished his staff would be discreet enough not to show drafts of his articles to report ers, because “I'll be damned if I'm the slave of ghost writers and speech writers.” He then said he felt the rhetoric of the original sentence was too strong for the thought. “I would have been impugning motives and I don't like to do that,” Muskie said. “And it would have looked as if were writing a polemic and not a reasoned article.” Harry McPherson says, “I'd like it if he'd occasionally open his mouth like the dragon in the medieval mystery play and let fire come out, but Senator Muskie equates flaming rhetoric with demagoguery. I remember a film dip I saw on TV one night of Bobby Kennedy going through a section of the Washington ghetto during the '68 primaries. Bobby was on a car top surrounded by an excited crowd of blacks. When ever their cheers subsided, he'd shout, There aren't enough decent places to live in this town for the people here.’ After an enthusiastic chorus of ‘Amen’ from the old and ‘Right on’ from the young, Bobby would continue with, ‘I think we can do better.’ Everyone would scream and grab for his shoes and cufflinks. Bobby sure gave that audience the feeling that he was angry about the lack of housing and the fact that the powers‐that‐be weren't doing more about it, and the scene looked great on the network news shows that “There's no doubt in my mind that Ed Muskie feels just as strongly about the plight of the blacks, but he could no more make that two‐sentence statement in that purely emotional rhythm than Bertrand Russell. His intellect would rebel. First, he'd try to understand the entire low‐income housing situation and then he'd make a statement encompassing the num ber of substandard houses, the rea son the banks and the savings‐and loan institutions had failed to produce standard housing, and the types of programs that would be re quired to produce decent houses. It would be a rational progression —what the problem was, why it con tinued to be a problem, and what we could do to solve it. All the facts would be there, down to the last interest‐rate percentage. Bobby's emotional way has its merits and so does Muskie's logical way.” McPherson seems to accept the fact that the merits of Muskie's logical way don't include losing as many cufflinks or winning as many min utes on the Walter Cronkite Show as Kennedy's emotional way — “If Muskie came out for universal pub lic nudity he'd do it so calmly that no one would get excited,” he says—but that is probably because Mc Pherson, unlike some of Muskie's critics, accepts the fact that Edmund Sixtus Muskie is not Robert Francis Kennedy. A number of Muskie's crit ics are captivated by the retrospec tive mystique of Robert Kennedy. The mystique is selective. The Bobby to whom they compare Muskie is not the “bad” Bobby of the Joseph Mc Carthy era or the careful Bobby who didn't enter the New Hampshire primary in early '68, but the “good” Cesar Chavez / Bedford ‐Stuyvesant Bobby. THE point of McPherson's com ments appears to be that there is no new Ed Muskie. And Muskie himself resents, his aides notwithstanding, being asked if there is one. “I don't see how anyone can say that the Jackson State trip showed there was a new Ed Muskie,” the old Ed Muskie said recently. “I went to Jackson because a great deal of pub lic sympathy had been shown to the four white students who had been killed at Kent State 11 days earlier and it came to my attention that the black community felt there ought to be a comparable expression of sympathy for the black students. “The trip was a symbolic gesture. When I’ was Governor of Maine and a hurricane hit the state, I flew to the scene of the disaster, another symbolic gesture. The two trips are different in degree but not in kind. When Martin Luther King died, I went to his funeral on a Senate plane. You don't go around chartering planes when you're just a Senator from Maine. It's inappropriate. When you are considered a Presidential candi date, you feel the obligation to show leadership and you respond to that obligation. I should be more alert in responding to opportunities to show leadership than I am. I get to the office in the morning and I'd like to think about the important things and instead I find I have to talk to Mr. A, B, and C about legislative prob lems and before I know it the day has been consumed with minor de tails. I sink into the quicksand feel ing very frustrated.” Whenever anyone tells Muskie that he needs to change to meet the widespread criticism that his style is lackluster or that he isn't far enough out front on the burning issues of the day, he thunders, “I'm not going to twist and bend myself out of shape.” He doesn't think that a man of his age can change sincerely and he says that even if he could change without sacrificing his self‐respect he wouldn't, because it would be a political miscalculation. “I used to worry about my low profile,’” Muskie says. “Now I'm coming to the con clusion that the public is tired of all the strident, hot politicians and is receptive to a cool politician, one who doesn't flare his nostrils or shoot from the hip.” As for those who urge him to take stands on such current high‐risk po ?? issues as abortion, Muskie says, “The American people don't like extremists or extreme positions. If I'm pushed to try to please the left, I lose some Democratic votes and the independent and Republican votes I've always needed and gotten in Maine. I'm one of the few politi cians who can still talk to the hard hats and the blacks.” Muskie is hostile and defensive to those who urge him to change. One evening last April, he addressed a group of college professors and journalists in Cambridge. They had liked his National Press Club speech ‐and had asked him why he didn't speak out more often about Vietnam. He had replied, “That speech didn't start anything, so why should I? I don't think people care much about Vietnam. Elections are decided on personalities, not issues.” He had bemoaned the fact that President Nixon had preempted the one good issue he had—the environment—and he had said he couldn't find any other issues. “He sounded like a small kid complaining that another kid had stolen his ball,” one listener recalled. “When some of us sug gested some other issues—gun con trol, the drug problem, and so on—Muskie shrugged lackadaisically.” Muskie had spoken to his Cambridge audience of the need to build an “open society” and the need for Americans to trust each other. Sev eral of the professors and journalists, none of whom favored a closed so ciety or distrust, had tried to get Muskie to be more specific about what he thought was wrong with America and how he would seek to change it, but he “sought refuge in generalizations,” a Boston reporter When I asked Muskie why he thought the evening in Cambridge had gone badly, he said, “Usually that sort of reaction drifts down to me but this time it didn't,” and asked me to relay the complaints. When I did, he revved up and said, “Those prima donnas! What the hell good were they in '68? They sat on their hands in New York and Cam bridge and didn't do anything for the Democratic ticket. Listen to their advice and you'll lose whatever ra tional approath you have. No two of them even agree with each other.” ONE piece of advice Muskie re cently rejected in the old, cautious Ed Muskie fashion was that he ignore the Maine Senatorial election. The time he would spend campaigning in Maine for re‐election could be more profitably spent gadding about the country and collecting po litical I.O.U.'s for '72, some said. It was true that there was some criti cism in Maine of Muskie the Presi dential pretender. After his trip to Jackson, for example, one of Muskie's sisters heard him described as a “nig ger lover,” and some of the Maine newspapers managed to link Muskie's national ambitions with the loss by the Bath, Me., Ironworks of a destroy er contract to Litton Industries in Pascagoula, Miss. Still, Muskie was considered unbeatable. His conserva tive Republican opponent, Neil Bishop, a 66‐year‐old schoolteacher and ex‐dairy farmer, acknowledged that his aim was merely to keep Muskie's down. The old Muskie spent the better part of the last two months in Maine campaigning diligently, shaking hands at factory gates and on street cor ners, putting in appearances in V.F.W. and Rotary meetings. When he was asked some time ago why he had decided to campaign hard in Maine, Muskie said, “You still have to do the first things first. My relationship with the people of Maine is a very personal one. If a personal relationship is undermined, the whole thing goes at once. When you lose a friend, there's no way of regaining him. I have to show my people that I haven't gone big‐city, that I'm the same Ed Musick they've always known. And if I get 65 per cent in November, all the commenta tors—you can run right through the litany beginning with Reston if he's at the top—will say, by God, he got 66.6 per cent in '64 so he's slipped in Maine, and if you're a Senator from a small state who has no god dam right to entertain national am bitions anyway...” THE Senator from Maine who does indeed entertain national ambitions was born on March 28, 1914, in Rum ford, a malodorous papennill town that is conducive to fostering an in terest in pollution. His father, Ste phen Marcdszewski, a Pole by birth, a tailor by trade, fled Russian‐oc cupied Poland to escape conscription in the Czar's army. After he came to the U.S., he married Josephine Czar necki in her hometown of Buffalo, N.Y., took her to Rumford on their honeymoon, and stayed there to open a tailor shop. The Muskies (the or iginal family name was eventually Anglicized) had six children. Muskie's mother and his four sisters still live in the Rumford area; his younger brother, Eugene, is a steel worker in California; his father died in 1956. Acquaintances of the Muskies in Rumford insist that the family was poor, but Muskie resents the adjec tive. In recent years, magazine pieces have apparently not been allowed to go to press unless they contain the adjective “Lincolnesque” to describe Muskie, who is 6 feet, 4 inches and has craggy features; possibly he thinks that to imply that he was born in a log cabin is going a little too far. Muskie spoke only Polish until he was 4, but there were just three Pol ish families in Rumford and he soon forgot the language. He remembers the flicker of the crosses burned by the anti ‐Catholic Ku Klux Klan on the outskirts of town and he was called “Polack” by many of his class mates, but he recalls his childhood as a very happy one, despite the local prejudice. There were many small town pleasures: skiing on the hills in back of the house before breakfast and skiing by moonlight, picking strawberries, building treehouses, and going on fishing trips with his father, who always spoke to him of the haa‐dships in the old country and the opportunities of the new. Muskie's mother, now 79 years old, still lives in‐the frame house the family bought in 1922. She is a lively, no‐nonsense lady, ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ho does her neighbors’ laundry and makes aprons, which she sells for $1.35 apiece, because she likes to keep busy. Mrs. Muskie takes her son's success in stride. “I told him, ‘Don't run for President,” she said recently. “Somebody has to do it but they can always find somebody.” Her older son was a quiet boy, who came right home after school and buried himself in his books, to her remembered regret. “I liked Eugene better,” she says. “Eugene was so happy‐go‐lucky. I always had much more fun with him. Ed was too seri ous.” When his mother's comment was repeated to him, Muskie, ever defensive, commented, “Eugene's happy‐go‐lucky, yes. On the other hand, he's had a heart attack and I haven't.” Muskie's sisters remember that their older brother was a stubborn young man with a nasty temper, who could tease them but could not take any teasing in return, and who hated to lose at anything. (A friend says that when he was in his 30's, he kicked over a Monopoly board after another player made a lucrative move.) His sisters claim he inherited his father's reserve. “Ed doesn't show affection, even to us,” one of them says, and his aides attribute his slow ness to praise and to display grati tude to this reserve. Muskie was valedictorian of his high ‐school graduating class and president of the high‐school student council. He went to Bates College in Lewiston with the help of scholar ships, summer jobs (washing dishes and bellhopping at a coastal resort) and school ‐year jobs (waiting on tables). At Bates he was Phi Beta Kappa, a member of the debating team, and class president for two years. He went on to Cornell Law School with the aid of more scholar ships and summer jobs. (Aside to Muskie's critics: It isn't just that Muskie is out of Horatio Alger, he makes the Horatio Alger hero look like a wastrel.) Upon his graduation from Cornell “The Mashie camp still frets over the aspirations of the Lancelot‐like john Lindsay” in 1939, Muskie came to New York City to be interviewed by a presti gious Wall Street law firm. “I had an interview with one of the partners,” Muskie recalls. “After we'd talked for quite a while the partner told me, ‘We'd love to have you, you're just what we want.’ I've always had a hunch that what really impressed them was that I looked like Leverett Saltonstall. Then the partner spent the rest of the day persuading me not to take the job. He described the horrors of commuting, assured me that there was more to life than making a living, and said, If I were you, I'd go right back to that beauti ful state of yours and practice law there.’ I took his advice and I've never regretted it.” Over 30 years later, Muskie still carries a chip on his shoulder as a result of having been dismissed for so many years as a man who would never go very far because of the political insignificance of his state. At the same time, he takes great pride in being Ed Muskie of Maine. Once during the Vice‐Presidential cam paign he returned to Maine after a month on the road; reporters noted that he was so overcome with senti ment that “his voice broke, his eyes misted over, and he filled the gap in his speech with a drink of water.” Muskie delights in telling Down East jokes in which the Mainer, with his Yankee horse sense, is more than a match for the city slicker. One of his current favorites concerns the out‐of‐stater who comes to Maine and sees two signs at a crossroads, one saying “Portland — 45 miles north” and the other “Portland—45 miles south.” “Does it matter which way I go to Portland?” the tourist inquired of a man who appeared to be a resident. “Not to me it don't,” the native replied. In 1940, Muskie opened a small law office in Waterville, served in the wartime Navy, and returned to his Waterville practice in 1945. In 1946, while waiting for clients to ap pear, he ran for the State Legislature and won. He had planned to serve one term but was elected to three, becoming minority leader during his second term. In 1946, he also met a local girl, Jane Gray, 13 years his junior, who worked in a Waterville dress shop. He took her out for lunch every day for 18 months. When he finally presented her with an en gagement ring and proposed, he told her he had been carrying the ring around in his pocket for quite a few months but hadn't wanted to give it to her until it was paid for. “That was just about the most honest state ment I'd ever heard and I said yes immediately,” Jane Muskie recalls. The Muskies were married in 1948. In 1952, the Maine Democratic party, such as it was, was weakened by Eisenhower's victory. The subse quent loss of patronage caused many of the older Democrats to neglect politics and in 1954 the leadership of the party fell to Muskie and a handful of other young men. The most vulnerable Republican was the incumbent Congressman from Mus kie's district, and Muskie, who was considered the party's most viable candidate, had agreed to run against him. When a few other men who had been asked to run for Gover nor declined to serve as sacrificial lambs, Muskie consented to run for Governor instead of for Congress. He didn't set out to win an elec tion—he had no idea there was an election to be won—but ran in the interest of building up a two‐party system. He covered 20,000 miles in his search for votes and proved ex tremely effective both at mano a mano campaigning and on TV, as he is today. He credits his surprising victory to Republican complacency and to his campaign themes, which dealt with Maine's economic under development, and the flight of its industry and of its young people. During his two terms, over 75 per cent of Muskie's legislative program passed and he is remembered as a popular and progressive Governor. IN 1958, Muskie ran for the Senate against the incumbent Republican, Frederick Payne. Senator Payne had accepted gifts from Bernard Goldfine, the Boston industrialist whose generosity to Sherman Adams had brought Adams's career in the Eisenhower Administration to an un timely end. Muskie says he didn't mention Payne's connection with Goldfine during the campaign, be cause “the story was already in the public domain and there was nothing I could add to what everyone already knew about Fred's difficulties. Also, I prefer to run on what I am, for positive rather than negative rea sons.” (In Muskie's biography, every other flashback is a flashforward; 12 years later he preferred to be for Tunney rather than against Murphy.) The Maine Democratic party Muskie and his friends founded is a strong one; Senator Margaret Chase Smith is the only Republican who now holds a major state office. Muskie found the transition from Governor of Maine (large fish in small pond) to Senator from Maine (small fish in large pond) difficult, but the stories he now tells of his Senate experience indicate how well his middle‐of‐the‐road pragmatism was suited to the Senatorial proposi tion that compromise is the stuff of life. The other day, reflecting on his 1959 run ‐in with L.R.J., Senator Muslcie said, “I always felt after ward that Paul Douglas made a mis take. At the time Douglas was push ing a majority vote for closure, there was also a compromise proposal afloat to permit closure by three fifths of the members present and voting If Douglas hadn't insisted on the majority vote, which didn't have a snowball's chance in hell of win ning, but had sought to compromise with Johnson, say, by supporting the three‐fifths position, Johnson might have been willing to accept that and see it through to victory. Instead, the Douglas proposal was defeated. Then the three‐fifths proposal came up for a vote, but its chances had been hurt by the loss on the Douglas proposal and it was defeated, too. Then L.B.J.'s proposal came up It won easily.” MUSKIE inevitably opts for the nourishment to be found in half a loaf rather than for the noble hunger in no loaf at all,” a friend from Portland says. In the last two years, Muskie hasn't had time for much of any thing except politicking. “I used to read The Times Book Review. Now I don't even know what's on the best‐seller list,” he laments. Before ‘68, he says, his life “flowed through orderly channels.” The Muskies have two comfortable homes, a tan‐painted brick colonial house across the District of Colum bia line in Bethesda, Md., and a sum mer cottage overlooking the golf course in Maine's Kennebunk Beach. In Washington, Muskie drives his own Chrysler to the office, has been seen in the supermarket with his wife, and, until the income from his writings and speeches increased two years ago, he worried about the ex pense of putting his five children through college. “Ed hasn't been in sulated from ordinary life the way some of New York's limousine liber als have been,” an old friend says. “He's still a bit of a country boy.” He likes golf, photography, puns, Chinese food, an occasional Old Fashioned, Time‐Life art books, and the tourist‐trappy paintings he pur chased in Paris and Rangoon on his Senatorial trips. When a dinner guest recently appeared at his Bethesda home with a bottle of red wine, he put it in the freezer and said he hoped it would be cold enough by dinner. Senator Muskie is very atten tive to detail_ His wife recalls that even during the '68 campaign he found time to paste her supermarket stamps in her stampbooks, and his secretaries say that he dictates let ters and speeches with every punctu ation mark in place. He gets his hair cut in Maine when he can, at a barbershop called The Razor's Edge, because “the barbers in Washington butcher it.” Recently one seat in the small plane Muskie charters reg ularly in Maine was broken; he kept after the pilot about it as relentlessly as he keeps after himself when he misses a golf‐shot until the seat was repaired. Muskie's aides say he enjoys com plaining. “He complained a lot dur ing '68 when we overscheduled him,” an aide recalls. “He also bitched when we underscheduled him. One day, we set aside an hour for him to have lunch alone with Mrs. Mus kie, and he inquired sarcastically, ‘What are we supposed to do, sit there and stare at each other?’” Politicians let reporters into their lives because they bear the gift of publicity. The politician knows the gift can prove to be a Trojan horse so he usually takes care to behave circumspectly in a reporter's pres ence_ Thus the genial man the re porter is permitted to see often bears little resemblance to the grump his Mends and staff know. Unlike most politicians, Muskie lets the reporter see him as he is. When he feels like squabbling with his wife because the lawn hasn't been mowed or lunch is late, or chewing out an aide for some misdemeanor, he does so unself‐con sciously in the reporter's presence. When he says he still does a little bird‐shooting but no longer shoots deer because “I can't stare down the gunbarrel at those soft brown eyes,” he lets it go at that. Most politi cians would promptly realize that the deer don't vote but the deer hunters do and would quickly add, “That's off the record.” Muskie also stands out in the po litical demimonde as a man who is not in love with the sound of his own voice, as an introvert, and as a man with a penchant for aloneness. He hates to give the same speech twice: it bores him. He is a very good listener and he is a reflective man who lets nothing get by him even in a casual conversation Not long ago, a friend commented to him that a recent vote in the Senate must have been an easy one for him. He could have nodded; instead he said skeptically, “The vote on the Tonkin Gulf resolution seemed easy in 1964. All but two of us voted for it We failed to project its implications into the future and now that easy vote is regarded by many people as an im‐ moral act.” THIS May 16, Senator Muskie gave an impromptu speech at the Maine Democratic convention in Portland. He acknowledged that he had voted wrong several times on Vietnam and urged the adoption of the platform committee's Vietnam plank, which condemned American intervention in Cambodia and called for an early withdrawal of all U.S. forces from Indochina. I asked Senator Muskie if he would be willing to go over his record on Vietnam with me and he agreed to do so one recent evening. Muskie says that, like most Amer icans, he went along with our orig inal involvement in Vietnam and with President Johnson's steady escaia tion of U.S. military intervention dur ing 1965 and 1966 because his vision of Southeast Asia was beclouded by the accumulated biases of World War H, Korea and the cold war. In September,1967, he went to Vietnam at L.B.J.'s behest to observe the election that was held to legiti mize President Nguyen Van Thieu's regime in Saigon. The presence of Senator Muskie and a delegation of other American public figures was part of the legitimization process, for they supposedly witnessed the fair ness of the elections. Since the elec tions, it is now generally agreed, were not honest and were arranged to keep an anti‐Communist govern ment in Saigon, I asked Senator Muskie why he had lent the prestige of his name to them, instead of declining L.B.J.'s invitation to go. “I wouldn't undertake to go to South Denmark, Maine, three days before an election and attempt to wheth  “A man who claimed in June that Muskie was too cautious has decided now that caution is a good quality in a nuclear‐age President and has mailed him a job‐seeking letter.” er the election was honest, and that's no reflection on South Denmark,” he replied. By January,1968, however, the bloodshed had begun to worry Muskie to the point Where he pri vately wrote to the President and asked him to stop the bombing of North Vietnam as an effort to open peace negotiations. The Communist offensive at Tet in late January fin ished many people on the war in Vietnam. Senator Muskie saw it as a “devastating setback” and says he felt “more definitely than before that the military adventure must some how be brought to an end.” Why didn't he say so publicly that spring? “I wasn't in the [Eugene] McCarthy camp, and I wasn't in the Humphrey camp,” Muskie answered. “I wasn't in the center of things. I was very much on the outside of the whole business. I just kept dwelling in my own mind on that letter I'd written to the President in january.” Muskie says that he went to the Chicago convention as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial campaign committee and delegate from Maine, “not as a part of any candidate's or ganization,” and that he became in volved in the struggle over the Viet nam plank when one of Humphrey's men came to him and “asked me for my help in trying to accommodate the hawks and the doves. So I went to see Mayor [Richard] Daley about using his influence with President Johnson on the plank. Daley said that was an area in which he had no influence with the President and he wasn't disposed to try to interfere, so I can't say that my influence was very meaningful but it was in that direction.” By the time of the convention in Chicago, the bombing issue had be come a symbol, a kind of moral watershed, of where a man stood on Vietnam. Why didn't Muskie break openly with the party establishment over the bombing issue, as Eugene McCarthy and Robert Kennedy had already done and as the minority fac tion did at the convention, instead of accepting Humphrey's invitation to organize the speakers for the ma jority plank? “When Humphrey asked me to or ganize the speakers for the majority plank, I took the lead speech,” Muskie says. “I thought that al though we hadn't been able to change the words of the plank to the ex tent some of us would have liked, I could give the words an interpreta tion that would accommodate both groups so that we could have a Viet nam policy everyone could live with. Words became symbols to people, but as I saw it the difference in the planks was a matter of semantics.” During the campaign, Muskie's let ter to Johnson of the previous Janu ary was inadvertently disclosed to the press by a friend of his from Maine. Why didn't he then seize the occasion to speak out loudly against the bombing? “The Vice‐Presidential candidate is not in the position to take the lead,” Muskie says. “To do what you're suggesting was not my role. You don't go on a national ticket and then repudiate cit. If you're interested in working toward an ob jective, then you decide whether or not a good way to do it is to be on the ticket. The alternative was Rich ard Nixon in the White House. There were those who said, ‘Humphrey or Nixon, what's the difference?’ The difference is becoming clearer every day.” DID he feel that the war was an issue on Which he could compromise for the purpose of the campaign, in stead of taking a no ‐compromise position as McCarthy did? “The ob jective was to end the war and to disengage from Vietnam,” Muskie says. “You could say, ‘If you don't take a clear‐cut stand against the war then I won't go on your ticket.’ I felt there was a better choice—to go on the ticket and to mute the dif ferences and try to help Humphrey move in the direction of a sound policy. My feeling about Humphrey was that his instincts would be the same as mine were it not for the fact that he was the Vice President under Johnson. Once he was Presi dent in his own right, he'd move in the same direction I would—to end the bombing, to move into meaning ful negotiations, to do whatever was necessary to end the war.” Ever since 1968, Muskie's instincts have led him to move gradually on the war. It took President Nixon's expedition into Cambodia last April to get Muskie to call publicly for the withdrawal of all American troops from Vietnam by the end of 1971—“because it seemed the only way finally for me to indicate my doubts that our present policy will end our involvement in Southeast Asia with in a time frame that reflects our real necessities and our real security as a nation.” MUSKCE is as reluctant to talk about the United States’ future role in Southeast Asia as he is now willing to talk about his past record on Viet nam. He knows where he wants to go but he doesn't really want to talk about it. Questions provoke shouts and the old debaters’ trick of trying to turn the question on the questioner, both tactics calculated to intimidate the interviewer and evade an answer. “You say you want to get out of Vietnam by the end of 1971, but are you willing to pay the price this might entail?” the interviewer, play ing devil's advocate, asks. “Suppose the old domino theory has some va lidity and that our withdrawal from Vietnam causes the present Cambo dian Government to collapse and we get an unfriendly government there. And suppose an unfriendly govern ment comes to power in Laos and Thailand because we leave Vietnam and most of our influence on the Southeast Asian mainland goes by the board. Is this price acceptable to your Senator Muskie scowls. “What the hell are you talking about?’ he asks, leaning forward in his easy chair in the pine‐paneled den in his home in Bethesda. “What the hell are you talking about?” he repeats, in a louder voice. He gets up and starts to pace back and forth across the room. “Do we have Southeast Asia to loser he shouts, whirling toward the interviewer. “Did we lose Red China?. “No,” the interviewer answers. “Chiang Kai‐shek did.” “That's right,” Muskie shouts, jab bing the air with his finger for em phasis. “So that's the answer.” “But it's not, Senator,” the inter viewer says. “My question is, are you willing to pay the ‘price for with drawing from Vietnam? Are you will ing to give up American influence on the Southeast Asian mainland?” “Jesus,” Muskie shouts, “you sound like John Foster Dulles with his pacts and all that nonsense. What influence are you talking about?” “Fm talking about the Govern ments in Vietnam and Cambodia and Laos and Thailand that are now friendly to the United States. I'm also talking about the air bases we have there. I'm talking about our physical presence. Are you willing to give all of this up?” the interviewer asks. “We haven't got it to lose,” Muskie says, in a parade‐ground voice. “We influence those Governments, but we don't control those countries. Am ready to give up air bases, the good will of those Governments with what ever consequences may follow? Hell, yes, I'm willing to give those up. We have influence of a sort imposed by an enormous expenditure of Ameri can treasure and lives out of all proportion to their impact. And prob ably what influence we're exerting is running counter to the will of the people in that area.” “No American Government since the end of World War II has been willing to say the power game there wasn't worth the candle,” the inter viewer observes. “There are unfriendly governments coming to power all over this planet,” Muskie says, smiling with amuse ment, his anger dissipated now that an answer has been pried out of him. “As a matter of fact, there's a Government in power in this coun try right now that's unfriendly to me and there's not much I can do about it.” He sits back down and begins to speak quietly and thoughtfully. “We'd like beneficently to influence the af fairs of people living in adverse cir cumstances all over the world, but unfortunately our power to do so is goddam limited. We're beginning to understand that whatever influence we're going to exert in Southeast Asia is going to have to be of a different kind from what we have now. It's going to have to be a lot wiser and more sophisticated than it has been. And, goddam it, I'm afraid that in Southeast Asia we're not going to have any influence at al) for many years to come because we've banged up those countries so badly.” Some of Muskie's new foreign policy advisers say that he may have been late in learning the lessons of Vietnam but that he has finally, learned them. “His pragmatism got in his way in '68,” one of the Muskie advisers says. “Now It leads him to accept the bounds of reality that have been defined by time and tur moil. He realizes that our Southeast Asian foreign policy has been founded on the mistaken assumption that we have a proprietary interest there. He is no ideologue like Riohard Nixon, torn between gut anti‐Communism and the restrictions imposed on the exercise of American power in the seventies, a man who plunges into Cambodia to protect a vision of America the awesome, an America whose pride will brook no obstacle, an America that will have its self righteous way.” MUSKIE says he doesn't care what his critics say about his record on Vietnam. If they find his reasons for maintaining his long public silence on what they deemed an issue of moral imperative unconvincing; if they are persuaded that he took the lead speech on the majority plank in Chicago because to have done other wise would have cost him the Vice Presidential nomination; if they say that Muskie's pragmatism, often a great strength, becomes a weakness when he is confronted with a situa tion where the conventional, go‐see Mayor Daley way will not work and where radical break ‐with ‐Johnson measures are called for and would have won the election; if they say that Muskie is antiwar now only because it is politically expedient for him to be antiwar, so be it. “People will have to accept my shortcomings,” Muskie says. “I'm for no more Vietnams but what the hell does that mean and what does it prove? What good would any reas surance from me be? I'm not a very good witness to reassure them. Anything I say would be self‐serving. People have got to take me and my views as they are and as they de veloped, whether or not they repre sent what people now feel safe with. I can't put that in people's minds and I'll be damned if I'll calor it with a lot of rhetoric in the form of soothing syrup.” IMPRESSION‐MAKER. The Muskies at the polls in Waterville this month. He has a knack for impressing people favorably—and, as he himself muses, “Truman beat Dewey because people found his human qualities more reassuring...” NOVEMBER, 1970. Two years down and two years to go. At the midpoint, Muskie is so far ahead of other would‐be candidates like Sena tor George McGovern, in the prepara tions for a Presidential candidacy as well as in the polls, that he appears not so much the Democrats’ front runner as the Democrats’ only run ner at the moment. He has already set up a Washington office from Which to mount a national campaign, begun fund‐raising activities, and made useful contacts with party leaders and power brokers in a num ber of high‐vote states like California. This election eve, Muskie appeared on national television to answer The Nixon‐Agnew campaign of fear on the law‐and‐order issue. His speech, which accused the Republican leader ship of slander, lying, and trying to arouse the darker instincts of the electorate, was a tough one but its tone was restrained. In the hurly burly of '68, Muskie's style won over many prospective Wallace voters; he was able to tell them things they didn't really want to hear because they found him credible. The turbu lence of the 1970 elections again played to Muskie's strong suit—the calm sell. In the midst of trouble he con veyed an aura of steadiness, a belief that the country's problems could be solved if only we faced them with the best that was in us. Sitting in the living room of a friend's home and talking to the election audience about the crisp Maine weather, Muskie conveyed the “sense of place” he referred to in his speech. His authenticity is part of his appeal and that night on TV he offered a sharp contrast to Nixon, the name‐calling, rootless Southern Californian. Muskie seized the opportunity of election eve to take on the President and the Vice President in a forthright manner and to appear as the spokesman of the party. His supporters hope that he will continue to dominate the party lead ership in the future. The future may or may not be as easy as election eve. As Teddy Kennedy said on election night, “Muskie was an excellent spokesman but we have many other fine spokesmen as well.” Muskie's friends and critics con cur that his first priority, now that the Maine election is safely behind him, is to replace a good part of his staff. “One of Humphrey's greatest failings was that his staff never im proved as he rose in the hierarchy,” a prominent Washington lawyer says. “With a few, very few exceptions, the guys now working for Muskie deserve no more than 70 on a scale of 1 to 100, and that includes most of the people he's hired since '68 as well as those who have been with him for years. It's painful to say that, because they're such nice guys, but they're yes‐men and timid amateurs. They seem to be hired because they're conciliatory and nonabrasive rather than because they're the most talented people available. “They have no idea of Muskie's requirements in the way of a sched ule, in the way of solid position papers on topics like open housing and open schools to implement his open society theme, and in the way of an instant‐response capability on current issues like the arms race or crime. He's still a provincial states man who doesn't know enough to be President, but he's enormously intel ligent and he can learn. It will hurt Muskie's chances tremendously if he doesn't upgrade the staff so that can help him as much as the unpaid advisers like Warnke have been doing.” I ASKED the Washington lawyer, as I had asked the judge in Portland, the college professor in Waterville, and the countless others who told me Muskie's staff was more of a threat to him than his Democratic rivals, if they had given Muskie the benefit of their convictions. No, they had replied, and then asked me to pass along their comments—anonymously, please. It is a famous fact that Presi dents are insulated from uncongenial truths by their friends and advisers. Obviouly, the emperor's new clothes syndrome can set in long before a man reaches the White House and it does tell us something about the emperor. For many months after losing the pre‐Chappaquiddick race against Teddy, Muskie seemed to see himself as a worthy King Arthur who was doomed to lose Guinevere to a more dashing Lancelot. The Muskie camp still frets about the political aspira tions of the Lancelot‐like John Lind say, and as for Teddy, Muskie is the first to say that “it is a mistake ever to underestimate the resilience of the Kennedys or the hold they have upon this country,” but Muskie's self confidence is rising as the polls rise. The latest Harris poll shows Muskie tied with Nixon in the public favor, each getting 43 per cent of the vote. One suspects that as a man's belief that he is going all the way increases, his chances of going all the way increase accordingly. Barring the unforeseeable, no one doubts that Muskie will make a for mal announcement of his candidacy sometime in 1971 and that he will enter the various primaries, starting with New Hampshire, in 1972. To many of Muskie's critics in the Democratic party, Washington under Richard Nixon is like Paris under German occupation. They would prefer to win in '72 with Kennedy or McGovern, but they would rather win with Muskie than see the party divided as it was in '68 and lose. A number of liberals seem to feel the way John Kenneth Galbraith does. Gal braith recently said that Muskie would present more of a problem for the liberal wing of the party than some of the other potential candi dates such as McGovern and Kennedy, but “not an insu perable one.” Muskie's pragmatism is easily matched by the prag matism of those of his critics who would like to participate in a Democratic restoration. As his attitude changes from I969's sour grapes and early 1970's self‐pity to something approaching optimism, theirs is changing from wait‐and‐see to jump‐on‐the‐band‐wagon. Take another look at the half empty bottle and, lo and be hold, it appears half full. A man who claimed in June that Muskie was too cautious has decided in October that cau tion is a good quality in a nuclear‐age President and has mailed off a job‐seeking letter. Another man who said in July, “Muskie doesn't turn me on,” now says, “If he can convince me he can win with out being exciting, that's O.K., too.” THE folly of writing about Presidential races in the future tense has been well estab lished in the last decade. In November,1962, John F. Ken nedy seemed certain to be re nominated in 1964. In Novem ber,1966, Lyndon B. Johnson was going to be the man to beat in 1968. In November,1970, the going assumption, for whatever it's worth, is that Richard Nixon will be the Republican Presidential candidate two years from now and that Edmund Muskie will be his opponent. “In 1948, Truman beat Dewey because the public found his fundamental human qualities more reassuring,” Muskie said recently. “Dewey reminded everyone of the little man on the wedding cake. Richard Nixon is not a reassuring man and no matter what the polls say, Cambodia weakened his political fabric. So did this month's elections?’ If a Muskie‐Nixon race is in the cards for '72," Muskle hopes they will fall along '48 lines."""
TV Mailbag,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/22/archives/tv-mailbag-the-brouhaha-over-schoolhouse.html,"To THE EDITOR: IT is a rare and flattering experience to see one's programing philosophy debated by Jack Gould and Nat Hen toff at such length in the pages of The Times. I must admit, however, that I did not entirely recognize some of the description of that philosophy. I would like to add a few words of my own. First, I am confused by some of the things said by Gould. In his first “Free Time” review, a few weeks back, he felt we at Channel 13 had an obligation im mediately to counter a song on mari juana with a discussion of “the serious social issue it is” (despite our presenta tion moments earlier of an anti‐drug song by the Afro‐American Studio group). But in his subsequent Sunday piece he agreed that “equal time need not invariably he observed within the confines of a single program.” In other words, the boundaries and limits of tele vision are not set and finite; indeed can he changed within a short space of a few weeks. He also said in the Sunday piece that what we are doing is “both so im portant and so long overdue” that we bear an especially heavy obligation “not to make avoidable mistakes.” I am bothered by this because I think that what we're trying to do requires re examination not only of concepts like “equal time” and “balance” but also of traditional definitions of what is an “ob ligation” or a “mistake.” We are pres ently seeking to broaden the television audience for programs dealing with se rious issues; we arc also trying to find formats that attract a younger spectrum of viewers. In this—and in an effort to find ways of portraying reality—we are exploring what is or is not mandatory; what does or does not work. For instance, is it axiomatic that “il luminating information presented with mature responsibility” is better than un varnished expressions of authentic, an guished emotions? In the attempt to put those emotions in perspective, must we always resort to traditional forms of television dialogue? We think not. In “Free Time,” we are suggesting that truth may come out on top if we allow the viewer to use his own mind to react to statements (and even expletives). We use hosts from outside the usual roster of television middlemen because they are freer to question whether truth al ways sits equidistant between two dis parate points of view. Through this pushing of boundaries may come new ideas of what is or is not necessary on television. Meanwhile, our show “Another Look” provides us with an opportunity both for rebuttals of ideas expressed on “Free Time” and “Here and Now,” and a more traditional kind of television truth‐seeking. I find that both Gould and Hentoff have a different understanding of the term “minority programing” than we do. We mean neither Gould's “Blacks, Puer to Ricans, and Mexicans” nor Hentoff's “Those for whom the status quo is in supportable,” although we agree that those groups do get insufficient time to expound their ideas on television. We are all members of one minority group or another. We find ourselves repres ented on television by so‐called spokes men, pundits, or Hollywood stereotypes, seldom by our real selves. On Channel 13, we are trying to find room for larger proportion of this city's unseen “real selves.” This is the “minority programing” we are talking about. I'm not suggesting that we're not in terested in providing air time for the disaffected, the radical and the tradi tional minorities—we are. But Channel 13 does not intend, as has been implied, to give air time only to the objects of Mr. Agnew's ire. As proof of that, the first five weeks of programing have of fered policemen, longshoremen, garment workers and students air time on “Here and Now.” Poets, policemen's wives, politicians (of all faiths), handball ex perts, jazz ensembles, New Feminists, blues guitarists, pianists, painters, an astrologer, ar. ex‐bookie‐raconteur, an ex‐addict (who spoke out against mari juana), a labor dispute, an ecology lec ture on Central Park, a discussion about abortion reform, and representatives of more traditional minorities have been seen on “Free Time.” A cautionary note: one show does not make a season; viewers will need to let their reactions to our ideas and our new programing come from more than one evening's viewing. A word concerning the fact that we have no nightly news show. It has been repeatedly suggested to New Yorkers that no matter what other programing we might he doing—whatever experi ments, whatever services—we are not meeting our obligations as Public Broad casters unless we have such a news program. The fact is that this is a finan cial matter: to have a news program this season would have required that we sac rifice almost all other local programing. No “Free Time,” no “Another Look,” no “Here and Now.” Since there were al ready 14 other news programs in New York, but no “Free Times” or “Here and Nows,” such a sacrifice did not seem judicious programing. We do believe in news programing, and we are looking for opportunities that would provide us with funds for both a probing local news program and other important local pro graming. Finally, I return to the admonition that because we're breaking new ground, we bear a “heavier‐than‐usual responsibility not to make avoidable mistakes.” I disagree. I don't think it's always possible to be both experimental and cautious. Even if it were, I'm not sure it would be wise: today's “mis take” may become a new way of finding the truth, tomorrow. P.S.: Hentoff suggests Channel 13 should be repeating “Schoolhouse or Jailhouse.” We're doing better than that; we're doing a sequel on Tuesday night (and perhaps others). It's our feeling that sequels are usually more useful than mere repetition. CHRISTOPHER W. LUKAS Director of Programing, Channel 13 WNET New York City “OUTRAGEOUS BIAS” To THE EDITOR: I support Jack Gould's views com pletely; it is time someone pointed out the biased nature of Channel 13's “Free Time” and “Here and Now.” Nat Hen toff's outrageous bias against the New York City public school system and The New York Times are too well known to need further emphasis. GERTRUDE ABERBACK New York City “WHY NOT SHOW IT AGAIN?” To THE EDITOR: In his response to my article, Jack Gould was understandably flustered be cause he not only had not seen “School house or Jailhouse” — on which he commented at length on the same page, bastinadoing me in the process—but he had apparently not heard it all on his sound recording. Gould: “Only long after the program started—not at the beginning—did he [Hentoff] proclaim his advocacy role.” The transcript of that program af firms that some fifteen minutes after the two‐hour program had begun, stated: “Anybody who knows anything about education knows where I stand.” (Presumptuous, but not reticent.) Louis Shuker, principal of Jamaica High School, instantly concurred, emphasiz ing that I “arranged myself” on the side of Edgar Friedenberg, among others. Furthermore, at the very beginning of the program, in my introduction, I also so stated, listing myself with John Holt, Paul Goodman and other critics of the public schools. That may well have been an act of hubris on my part, as Shuker charged fifteen minutes later. But I could not have been clearer in stating that I was not a referee. Gould also charges that when Shuker —who spoke at length on the program —was interrupted by members of the audience, I “often was strangely silent or argumentative.” In fact, as the tran script will bear out, I kept insisting—and successfully—that he be heard. Yes, I was sometimes “argumentative” with Shuker. As I've already noted, I had made clear that I was not an above‐the battle moderator. But I did make sure he was heard. With regard to my hav ing been responsible for Blanche Lewis of the United Parents Association re ceiving “distressingly short shrift” (an other Gould accusation), the fact is that I refused to let the program continue until she had a chance to clarify re marks which members of the audience had misunderstood. As for the program having been stacked, I was not responsible ‘for the selection of the participants—either the panelists or the audience—but I do not disavow the composition of either. The range of views among those present was, to say the least, diversified, and recognized people in turn (all but few of whom I had never seen before) as they came to the microphones on the floor. This debate, in any case, would be best settled for the individual reader who did not see the program (and expect most readers did not) if Channel 13 were to repeat it. There are those after all, who disagree with Gould's estimation of its (Continued on Page 24) value. Dr. Henry Lahey of the Bank Street College of Education has characterized “Schoolhouse or Jailhouse” as “a landmark in bringing to the public's attention the powerlessness of students in the public schools as well as the despair of many par ents and others who are aware of the situation.” Dr. Lahey, of course, is not a television critic; but he knows something about edu cation, and he did see the whole program. Along with number of other educators, Dr. Lahey has asked for tape of “Schoolhouse or Jail house” for instructional use. But why not show it again for interested? That is, if all this contro versy has not intimidated the management of Channel 13. Gould expresses surprise that I did not name the Channel 13 official who told me a re run could not presently be scheduled because of the con troversial impact of the pro gram. As a reporter, has Gould no idea of the working conditions in much of public broadcasting? My source asked not to be named, cit ing the danger of getting into trouble with higher manage ment if said source were to engage in public controversy with so powerful a personage as the television critic of The New York Times. (There are more officials—people hold ing positions of authority—at Channel 13 than those cited by Gould.) I am free of institutional anxieties—an attitude which may never get me invited back to Channel 13 but which helped make the difference between “Schoolhouse or Jailhouse” having been yet another polite glossing of desperate problem and the very real evocation of the crisis in the public schools that the program actually was. NAT HENTOFF New York City ‘REAL DYNAMITE’ To THE EDITOR: Along with Nat Hentoff, I regret that Jack Gould did not actually see “School house or Jailhouse.” To get its full impact without see ing it would be impossible. Here, however, Hentoff and I part company. What I saw on the faces of the obviously very carefully stacked audi ence participants was not scorn turning to delight, but hatred, arrogance, imma turity, and contempt! A more inflammatory, vicious, and distorted program.I have nev er seen on TV and I so wrote the FCC. I wonder if Louis Shuker and Mrs. Blanche Lewis would have accepted the in vitation to be on the program if they had known what to expect, and whether that knowledge might not have been what kept others from accepting. Shuker sensed very early what company he was in. His exemplary beha vior and intelligence (no, had never heard of him be fore) served as a very real contrast to that of his adver saries. A lesser man would have walked opt early in the program. One of the most intelligent questions asked that night by a gentleman who was prob ably a teacher, and to whom Hentoff gave short shrift and no answer, was, “What do you think you have accom plished by this program?” would venture to reply, the rioting in the subway by George Washington High School students, some of whom were in the audience, that followed close on the heels of “Schoolhouse or Jail house.” There is real dynamite in this type of program and the damage it can do is incalcul able. Just how it can be avoided, short of censorship, is a very real challenge, but a challenge that must be met if our civilization is to survive. Giving “equal time” a few weeks later is no answer. The damage has already been done. ADELAIDE RODSTROM ROSENFELD The Bronx, N. Y. ‘FREE OF BIAS?’ To THE EDITOR: Does Jack Gould really be lieve that over the past 10 years of “talk shows” moder ators have been free of “bias”? I look back and see and hear program after pro gram of loaded panels relying on their strongest ally—the middle‐class moderator — to keep our world neat, clean and patronizing. And they did, to the visible angry frus tration of “minority” panel guests who seemed, so of ten, unable to articulate their points of view politely in the time allotted. I was frightened, frustrat ed, excited and thoroughly alive as I looked and listened to “Schoolhouse or Jail house” on Channel 13. Shu ker turned up, and for that give him “A” for effort. It's not an easy situation to find oneself in, and he presented such a closed, strongly armored front that I felt sorry for him. The students, parents, teachers presented themselves openly for all to experience their hurts, angers, frustrations and hopes. No, it wasn't perfect. Con tinued hours of confrontation would have been more pro ductive, but within the time given it produced a whole lot of reaction. Hopefully it also produced some action. And most hopefully Channel 13 will not be frightened by let ters or professional critics into pulling back into our col lective middle‐class, badly cracking shells. Our world is scary and I am often scared. Surely it is best to step forth and share openly our com mon fears. Fear is expressed differently but felt collective ly. Fear explored fully, clears our heads, hearts and guts for joy — expressed differently and shared collectively. I look forward to more Channel 13, Nat Hentoff moderated, and other “Here and Now” and “Free Time” programs. Peace. MADELEINE SHERWOOD New York City ‘A DECENT WAY’ To THE EDITOR: How fortunate is the print ed word — so safe, in these confrontation days, from in terruption by abusive heck ling, so invulnerable to sud den seizure by what Nat Hen toff calls “rude reality.” The subject: Channel 13's “Here and Now” program, “School house or Jailhouse,” and Hen toff's strange performance as moderator. Eleven hundred printed words by Hentoff de fending his conduct in The Times—provocatively debat able words—yet flowing in unbroken continuity, not a single one of them drowned out by a shouted expletive. Approximately the same number of words by Jack Gould in reply, all similarly protected. Some million read ers pondered Hentoff's words and Gould's words and formed judgments, free of the jarring distraction of shouted vituperation and harassing outbursts. Now isn't that a decent way to conduct a discussion, and shouldn't Hentoff be grateful to The Times for be ing so efficient and open minded a moderator, and shouldn't Hentoff consider that any discussion program, whether in print or on the air, can best serve its purpose when it is conducted in an orderly manner? Under the conditions which prevailed and which Hentoff helped promote on the “Schoolhouse or Jailhouse” program, here, very roughly, is how Hentoff's article in The Times might have fared: HENTOFF (as quoted from his Times piece): Jack Gould's reactions in recent weeks... raise the question of whether Gould is himself fully ready for what happens when real ity, rude reality— VOICE: Rude is right, Hen toff! And you're the one that's rude, not reality! You have one helluva nerve, Hen toff— HENTOFF: Now, if you will just let me complete my thought. What I am trying to say— GOULD: What do you mean I'm not fully ready for what happens, Hentoff? Who are you to tell me when I'm ready or not? VOICES: Right on, Jack! Give it to him, Jack! HENTOFF: Now, Mr. Gould, your paper invited me to ex press my views here. I have a 1,100‐word statement that will take me only about six or seven minutes to read and I— VOICE: Give him five! VOICE: Give him three! GOULD: All right, folks! Now listen, folks! Mr. Hen toff has a point here. Now I know you don't agree with him any more than I do, but I say let's hear him out. Let's cool it, shall we?

NATE FEIN New York City ‘BREAKTHROUGH’ To THE EDITOR: As a viewer who found the first installment of “Free Time” a refreshing and ar resting breakthrough in the use of TV as social documen tary, I want to take issue with Jack Gould on all counts. It seems to me that Gould's basic tenet must be vigorous ly refuted if TV is to move into its most potent and pro ductive area. The medium is most effective when it's used as an artery of direct depic tion and drama. The Good Guys and the Bad Guys don't need equal time. We need to be shown. If people of what ever persuasion and lifestyle are given exposure, the more untrammeled the better, they will make themselves and their attitudes known. The only requirement, as I see it, is that the program be sensi tive and that its intention not be manipulative. Trust the viewer. Concen trate not on equal time and balanced discussion, but on pertinence, imagination, hon esty, and excellence. Ob viously, if in the course of ensuing weeks, “Free Time” shows itself to be an unbal anced and distorted lens, it will dig its own grave. But as of now, Channel 13 is push ing for something appropriate and timely. One hates to see cold water thrown on its ef forts by pious and misguided pussyfooting. A word about panel pro grams. “Schoolhouse or Jail house,” the Nat Hentoff open forum on schools, could not have been “refereed” by any body. It was a frightening and jolting experience; it showed that the frustrated and outraged minority adher ents of community control and similar drastic reforms of the school system are not about to enter into moderat ed dialogue with anybody. Reasoned and polite parley is not the language of today's out‐groups; have you no ticed? If a situation is chaotic let there be chaos on our TV screens. Issues in the abstract can be moderated on all the balanced programs you like, but if any mountains within us are to be moved, it will be because we've seen it and heard it like it is. JANET R.

In Brief,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/22/archives/in-brief-sisterhood-is-powerful.html,"If anyone anywhere has a grandparent or maiden uncle still uninformed about Wom en's Liberation, this fiery col lection would make the perfect gift for Christmas 1970. In keeping with the egalitarian philosophy of sisterhood, both well known and entirely un known contributors, learned doctors and schoolgirls, are given full rein to protest, weep, mock, rant, swear or examine in‐depth. The book was not only written but produced and type set entirely by women—a tech nological breakthrough in itself —and it will not surprise any one that its tone is stridently, bitterly, sometimes amusingly anti‐men. It is also seriously, almost desperately, revolution ary: “More and more, I begin to think of a worldwide Wo men's Revolution as the only hope for life on the planet.” An Anthology of Writings From the Women's Liberation Movement. Edited by Robin Morgan. 602 pp. New York: Random House. $8.95. Among the personal state ments, poems and statistics there are position papers on every facet of the Women's Rad ‐Lib Movement: econom ics, marriage, physiology, poli tics, psychology and religion. Dr. Mary Sherfey's “A Theory on Female Sexuality,” “The Grand Coolie Damn” (an ex posé of the treatment of “chicks” in the New Left) by Marge Piercy, and “Women of China” by Charlotte Bonny Cohen are particularly inter esting. Lesbianism, karate and prostitution are of course not omitted. Editor Robin Morgan lays to rest a typical sexist misrepresentation of the media in a footnote stating flatly that “bras were never burned.” (They were, though, thrown into a Freedom Trash Can at the Miss America Pageant at Atlantic City in 1968, along with the curlers, false eye lashes and wigs.) An appendix lists conscious ness‐raising books, pamphlets and films to be studied (or boy cotted), abortion counseling in formation, and the names and addresses of new feminist wave “contacts,” from the Black Women's Liberation Committee to WITCH, whose initials can be infinitely varied to fit the crime. On Mother's Day, for instance, the sisters chose “Women Interested in Toppling Consumption Holidays” and is sued their own Hellmark card: “Every year we set aside a very special day/To remind you, Martyr Dear, that home is where you stay.” JEAN GARDNER ‘Busy Times’ Human Documents of the Age of the Forsytes. By E. Royston Pike. 320 pp. New York: Praeger Publishers. $10. Galsworthy's Forsyte chroni cles, especially as dramatized on radio and TV in the last two or three years, are a point of departure for this survey of documents out of the 1880's and 1890's. That may bring in more readers, which is fair enough; but E. Royston Pike needs no topical peg to warrant our attention. He knows how to pick and prune and supply continuity to create a lively book. In this one, third in his series of social histories, he has ransacked another mountain of source material — the “Hand Book of House Sanitation” (1882); “The Art of House keeping” (1889); “The Life and Labor of the People of London (17 vols., 1902‐03); early writ ings of Mrs. Sidney Webb and Annie Besant; the first report of the Royal Commission on the Housing of the Working Class es (1884‐85) and a dozen other books and magazine and news paper articles. The result is not just a pic ture of the privileged Forsyte world, with its devotion to comfort and the niceties of status, but a panorama of Eng land at the peak of its imperial prestige. We learn that “a vir tuous woman has a repugnance to excessive luxury in her underclothing” and that “to wear the garter below the knee is against all rules of taste.” We also get a vivid picture of the overcrowding in London's slum tenements, with conse quences in crime and dissipa tion, that bears a startling re semblance to America's city slums today, as do the atti tudes of the well‐to‐do toward the poor. In spite of the quaint ness of sober, Victorian prose; the course of empire seems fa miliar. PAUL SHOWERS Myselves When Young By Frank Budgen. 212 pp. New York: Oxford University Press. $7. In the 1930's Frank Budgen published his reminiscences of James Joyce. Now, in his eigh ties, he has produced another book of recollections, the story of his growing up in and around London and his subse quent migration to Paris and Switzerland. In the first five chapters he writes in third per son of the five selves—small boy, Marine Society trainee, merchant seaman, postal clerk and artist's model—that pre ceded his emergence as a painter who found a place for himself in the world of the arts in the years preceding and dur ing World War I. It is a useful device for avoiding some of the limita tions of first‐person narrative and the difficulties of auto biography recaptured at a dis tance. But there is also the temptation to present the past subjectively, sidestepping the tedium of dates and complete identifications. This is no haz ard in the highly personal experiences of childhood and youth, which Budgen records with rich imagery and sensitiv ity; but when he moves into his young manhood, switching to first person and taking note of historic events and person ages, the increasingly subjec tive approach can lose the reader in yesterday's uncharted byways. The book is mercilessly lack ing in footnotes. In addition, Budgen frequently lapses into that cryptic, abrupt style of allusive utterance which among educated Britons seems to be a substitute for slang. The thought, darting out in unfin ished fits and starts, can, in some instances, reduce fear some British understatement to incomprehensibility. In compen sation for the murky passages, however, there are impressive pictures of Europe's thought ful younger generation haunted by the growing foreshadow of World War I (ominously like the mood besetting today's younger generation), as well as further glimpses of Joyce in Zurich and, later on, Ezra Pound and Wyndham Lewis in London P. S. Mark Twain And John Bull The British Connection. By Howard G. Baetzhold. 394 pp: Bloomington: Indiana University Press. $15. In 1872 Samuel L. Clemens went to England for the first time. There began an on‐again, off‐again love affair with that country and its people that was to last until Clemens's death in 1910. At the start, Clemens found everything English to his liking—except the toast and potatoes and the clothes. For all his fostering of the image of himself as a simple, unlet tered backwoodsman, he rev eled in invitations to the homes of lords and ladies and to the select gentlemen's clubs. When the English liked Cle mens as a speaker and writer, he liked them. When they didn't, he became their cross critic, attacking chivalry and monarchy and aristocracy, as in “A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.” Howard G. Baetzhold of But ler University has written an exhaustive study of the Eng lish influences on Twain. He points out the parallels between “Pepy's Diary” and “The Ad ventures of Huckleberry Finn,” between “Enoch Arden” and “The Adventures of Tom Saw yer,” Charlotte M. Yonge's ju venile writing and “The Prince and the Pauper.” He tells of Clemens's distaste for Sir Wal ter Scott, whom he blamed for the American South's excessive romanticism. The difficulty with Mr. Baetzhold's book is that it tells the casual Mark Twain enthusiast more than he wants to know, while offering schol ars much that they are already aware of.

ROCKEFELLER SEEKS LOCAL‐LEVEL HELP TO OBTAIN U.S. AID,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/22/archives/rockefeller-seeks-locallevel-help-to-obtain-us-aid-separate.html,"Governor Rockefeller sched uled meetings with the state's mayors, county executives and school boards yesterday to seek their support in his drive to ease the state's fiscal crisis by obtaining more funds from Washington. Mr. Rockefeller will meet with the county executives on Nov. 30, with the mayors on Dec. 7 and with representatives of school boards Dec. 8 and 9. Since his re‐election to a fourth term, the Governor has all but confined his public com ments to dire utterances about “destruction” of the state's economic stability if it is forced next year to raise taxes again because it cannot get more Federal funds. To Meet Representatives Tomorrow night he will meet in Washington with the New York Congressional delegation in an attempt to convince the members of the need for goad ing Congress into sharing more Federal funds with the state. Mr. Rockefeller says the state sends $23.5‐billion in taxes to Washington while re ceiving only $2.5‐billion in re turn. He has added that $500 million to $1‐billion more was needed from the Government just “to hold the line at present’ levels of activity.” The state's fiscal crisis will dominate the Republican‐con trolled Legislature when it con venes in Albany on Jan. 6 in a session that is expected to be enlivened by attempts to modi fy the newly liberalized abor tion law. to increase aid to pa rochial schools and to curb the power of the Liberal and Con servative parties. Thousands of Bills Due Thousands of bills will come across the desks of New York's 150 Assemblymen and 57 Sena tors during the 194th annual ‘legislative session. But the flood of bills will be ‘,overshadowed by the issue of money and where to get it to balance a record state budget that, according to some legisla tive sources, is expected to rise from its present $7.2‐billion to about $8‐billion if the state is, lat least partially, to respond to the ever‐increasing demands of localities for funds, particular ly for the cost of health, edu cation and welfare. The Federal Government ap pears to carry the state's hopes for relief at the present time. But it is considered unlikely that Congress, faced with a Federal budget imbalance, will do much to help the state. Most likely, legislative sources say, there will be state tax in creases. Mr. Rockefeller has said that such a move is likely, “if you add up the negatives,” but that it is “premature to come to any conclusion.” High on the list of such “negatives” is a possible drop in anticipated tax collections. The Rockefeller administration had predicted an increase of $545‐million in revenues for the fiscal year ending March 31. But State Controller Arthur Levitt recently reported that state tax collections for the first seven months of this fis cal year were only $25‐million ahead of the comparable pe riod last year. One high official of the State Division of the Budget said the state still had time to realize most of its predicted revenue increases since late December traditionally was a time when many corporate profit returns were filed and that so far such key industries as General Elec tric, Eastman Kodak and Xerox Corporation were doing well. This official declined to spec ulate on a dollar amount for the budget for the 1971‐72 fis cal year, saying that it was “much too early for us to jump on any type of figure.” The budget division is winding up nearly a month of closed hear ings with heads of state depart ments on their projected needs and all of them have been told by the Governor to “trim the fat” from these projections. Statewide Plan Pressed One of the big items will be a request from state social serv ice authorities for a $115‐mil lion cost‐of‐living increase in payments next year to the state's 1.7‐million welfare re cipients. Interrelated proposals by the State Board of Social Welfare and the State Social Services Department ask that a single, statewide level of assistance be established, in place of the cur rent regional system. The state and local governments would contribute an additional $34.5 million each and the Federal Government $46‐million to pro vide the cost‐of‐living increase. In an interview in his un pretentious law office in Nia gara Falls the other day, Senate Majority Leader Earl W. Brydges, a Republican who is the most powerful man in the Legislature, was asked about, possible state tax increases. “I still don't think it's nec essary,” Mr. Brydges said, wielding his cigarette like a pointer. “We still have some bonding capacity that could relieve the operating budget.” If new taxes are warranted, the Senator said, it would most likely be an increase in the state income tax “as against, general increases in the sales tax.” Commenting on next year's budget, Mr. Brydges said: “It's got to go up. I hope it doesn't go to $8‐billion, but just by the very nature of things it's got to go up.” An adamant and long‐time foe of reform of the state's 19th century abortion law, Mr. Brydges chose during the 1970 legislative session, which ended in April, not to stymie the issue in committee but to let it have an airing on the Senate floor. The Senate gave final ap proval to the state's new abor tion law—the most permissive in the country—which makes abortions a matter between a woman and her doctor up to the 24th week of pregnancy. Changes in Law Expected Mr. Brydges, who wept when the new law passed, said there would most likely be modifica tions made in the law in the 1971 session and that there was “pretty general agreement that there should be.” Assemblyman Stanley Stein gut, the Democratic Minority Leader from Brooklyn, said in an interview in New York City that “I think there would be, some amendments” in the abor tion law. Bills have already been pre filed in Albany to repeal the new law, but Mr. Brydges said that “more realistically I think there'll be a tightening up of the new law.” Mr. Brydges also said legis lation would be introduced that would restrict a candidate for office to one line on a ballot, a move that is certain to pro voke cries of alarm and a polit ical donnybrook from the Lib eral and Conservative parties against whom it is aimed. Both these minority parties have in the past supported major party candidates, giving them a sec ond line on the ballot. “You know what the effect is of splinter parties,” Mr. Brydges said.“They've got bar gaining power way eyond their numbers.” Would the Democrats go along with such a bill?, he was asked. “I would certainly think so,” the Senator replied. “The Dem ocrats are disenchanted with the Liberals and the Republi cans are disenchanted with the Conservatives.” Steingut Declines Comment Mr. Steingut declined com ment on the proposal, saying only that “we should talk about comprehensive electoral re form.” Mr. Brydges, who easily con trols the Senate, where there are 32 Republicans and 25 Democrats, said that Assembly Speaker Perry B. Duryea, Re publican of Montauk, might not have the same feeling. Mr. Duryea was on vacation land not available for comment, but what Mr. Brydges was al luding to was the fact that Mr. Duryea, who needs 76 votes to get a bill through the Assembly, must sometimes depend on the votes of Republicans who won election with Conservative sup port. The Republicans control the Assembly, 79 to 71, so Mr. Duryea can suffer no more than three defections in party‐line votes. In January there will he at ‘least seven Assemblymen sit ting on the Republican side of the house who owe their elec tion to the fact that they also were the nominees of the Con servative party. 13th Year for Governor Other matters that are ex pected to attract attention when the Legislature convenes in January, also a time when Mr. Rockefeller begins his 13th year in office, include the fol lowing: ¶Aid to parochial schools. Last session the Legislature ap proved $28‐million in aid to parochial schools in addition to the more than $40‐million an nually spent on sectarian schools through programs that skirt the strict language of the State Constitution prohibiting state funds for such schools. Mr. Brydges and Mr. Steingut both indicated that attempts to get more funds for parochial schools would be made during the session. The Legislature will also vote again on a bill repealing the strict language in the con stitution and replacing it with the less restrictive language of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. The bill to abolish the so‐called Blaine Amendment was passed in the 1970 session. Since it is a proposed constitutional amendment, it must be passed by two separately elected Leg islatures and then approved by the voters in a referendum. ¶Reapportionment based on the 1970 Federal Census, the Legislature is required to re apportion both legislative and Congressional districts in time for the 1972 elections. Mr. Brydges said this would not be done at the regular session but in a special session convened for the purpose in the fall of 1971. ¶The Executive Department. Governor Rockefeller is reliably reported to be planning to re place some officials who are nearing retirement age. Al though the Governor's office declines to comment on these reports, such state figures as Health Commissioner Dr. Hollis S. Ingraham, Industrial Com missioner Martin P. Cather wood, and Agriculture Commis sioner Don J. Wickham, are said to be about to be replaced litical primaries in September instead of June and thus shorten campaign periods is expected to have a good chance in 1971. ¶Pollution. Mr. Brydges said the Legislature might ask the voters for permission to float another pure waters bond issue. Five years ago the voters ap proved a $1‐billion bond issue for the construction of sewage disposal facilities in communi ties throughout the state. The funds are nearly exhausted. During the recent political cam paign, Mr. Rockefeller said it would cost $4.2‐billion to rid the state's waterways of muni cipal and industrial waste. ¶New York City. Mr. Brydges said there was a possibility that legislation to reform the New York City charter in effect, curbing the broad powers of the Mayor's office, might come up.’ Mr. Steingut said he opposed curtailing mayoral powers, but “I do think very strongly that Borough Presidents should be strengthened.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Crime is up, convictions down—why?; The Self‐Inflicted Wound",https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/22/archives/crime-is-up-convictions-downwhy-the-selfinflicted-wound.html,"On June 13, 1966, the Supreme Court by a bare 5‐4 vote handed down its famous decision in Miranda v. Arizona. According to the majority opinion, the prosecution, in order to introduce a confession made by a defendant in police custody, must show that before being questioned the accused was “warned that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement that he does make may be used as evidence against him and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or ap pointed.” Fred Graham, the Supreme Court correspondent of The New York Times, has built around this land mark decision, its predecessors and its successors, an absorbing, timely and well‐written book. One can com mend it safely to anyone, lawyer or layman, interested in the Supreme Court and its influence on our crimin al justice system. If there is a com plaint one can register, it concerns the title. Throughout most of the book one is under the impression that Mr. Gra ham believes the Miranda decision to have been a great and unnecessary blow to the Court's prestige and pow er—a self‐inflicted wound compar able to the Dred Scott decision, the legal tender cases and the income tax decision. In fact, it turns out that the author believes no such thing, and that in large part the “wound” amounted to the considerable amount of bad publicity which was heaped upon the Court, in part as a result of its own unnecessary lack of clarity. Graham makes it quite clear that the Supreme Court was moving far more gingerly in the most sensitive areas of the criminal law long before the two Nixon appointees had taken their seats. And as he points out, the “wound,” aggravated by a contem poraneous and almost certainly coin cidental rise in the crime rate, provides only one of the possible explanations for this phenomenon. Another explanation is that the Court's confident assumption of omnipotence, and indeed the whole ethic of redemption through central ized decision‐making in Washington, was beginning to fade. And finally, the Court began rather suddenly to realize that its success, both philo sophically and administratively, in purifying our judicial procedures was not so easily repeated in the far more difficult and complicated task of policing the police. As Graham demonstrates, the Court's decisions on the rights of sus pects have in fact had very little effect in handcuffing the police. There may, indeed, have been a small num ber of criminals — including some quite dangerous ones — who were released because of Supreme Court rulings. But as far as we can tell, the major impact of its decisions has been to permit our society to main tain a higher level — at least on the books — of adherence to consti tutional rights while at the same time suffering relatively little practical in convenience. Indeed, one of the amazing things about our criminal‐law system was that it could have endured so long in a state of tension where the law on the books — not only the Consti tution but the statutes as well—gave the citizenry the protections against government which the most refined and idealistic society would wish to extend to its members, and yet at the same time the law, as actually enforced on the streets, was so tough that these protections usually van ished whenever they were really needed. Sooner Or later an open so ciety must confront such glaring in consistencies; and it is quite remark able that when the Supreme Court did face up to the issues (and Gra ham's discussion of the cases them selves are models of informativeness), it did so little damage either to our pretentions or to our practices. There is no doubt that the influ ence of the Supreme Court on our criminal law has been a healthy one —especially since it has cost us so little. In great part this influence has been educational and hortatory, far beyond any particular rules enunci ated, and it has encouraged the grad ual humanizing of the whole criminal process. So far as we can tell, physi cal brutality in the station house to day does not approach the levels found in the massive report of the Wickersham Commission (National Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement) in 1931, and even our most law‐and‐order oriented public officials these days would not dare to engage publicly in the sort of di alogue which took place in 1945 be tween the liberal Mayor of New York, Fiorello LaGuardia, and his police commissioner: Commissioner Valentine (referring to a prisoner in the police lineup): “He's the best‐dressed man in this roam....Don't be afraid to muss ‘em up. Blood should be smeared all over that velvet collar.” LaGuardia: “That's the way I like to hear you talk, Lew. Muss ‘em up if necessary.” (Time, Sept. 15, 1945) But if police crime is less frequent than it once was, as Mr. Graham makes very clear, over‐all crime of the types we should be most worried about — violent assaults upon the person and serious property offenses —have increased enormously in the last few years. Some of the reasons for this—better reporting, increased urbanization, and the disproportion ately greater number of people in the age groups most prone to violence—are well known—and Graham shows considerable sophistication in recog nizing the many pitfalls in the area of crime statistics. A major reason generally not discussed in liberal so ciety, but which Graham does point out, is that the past four years have seen an enormous increase in crimes —especially armed robbery—com mitted by the young, black residents of our urban ghettos. Along with most of those knowl edgeable about the determinants of crime, Graham does not believe that any significant increase in our se rious crime rate can be traced to the direct impact of any—or indeed all—of the Supreme Court's rulings which allegedly “handcuff” the police. Nonetheless, the coincidence in time between the rise in our crime rates and the Supreme Court adventures in improving the administration of the criminal law has been damaging to the Court — for, by any standard, the prevalence of crime in American society is one of our most serious problems. However, Graham does show one way in which the Supreme Court may have subtly and indirectly hampered the control of crime. The fact is that the sum of all of the protections that the Supreme Court has erected around the citizen has thrown an enormous load not only upon our judicial pro cesses but upon the police and pros ecutorial agencies which must spend time, energy and manpower litigating whether in fact these protections have been observed. And even where the protections themselves cause rel atively little inconvenience, litigation over them may be a serious drain. The importance of this, Graham suggests, is that much unsolved crime is due simply to the overburdening of our crime‐fighting institutions. Al though about the same number of criminals are convicted each year, the percentage of convictions has fall en as crime increases. A great deal can be done about this. Improvements in the efficiency of the police are long overdue, and the bureaucratic impediments erected by civil‐service regulations and po licemen's unions cannot much longer delay these. Tinkering will not, however, be nearly enough. We simply need vast ly more resources applied to our criminal processes. This applies to our police, whose pay and status reveal quite clearly that we do not appreciate the demands — for re straint as well at action — which we place upon them; to our criminal courts where the delays in our justice have become a national scandal; and perhaps most glaringly to our insti tutions of corrections such as our jails, prisons, probation and parole agencies. Here penny‐pinching has most demonstrably increased the crime rate and, of course, the eventu al cost to all. Indeed, one of the few consolations one can have over the low rate of conviction for most crimes is the fact that to a great ex tent criminals leave our correctional institutions considerably more crimin alistic than when in. If resources were without end, the problem might be controlled simply with “enough money.” However, in these times of scarcity of resources it is vital to put first things first. The crimes most worrying to most people are those against persons and prop erty, and until these are brought under far better control we must be extremely skeptical about the use of the criminal law in enforcing the majority's ideas of morality upon large minorities. Some of the most eminent scholars or the criminal law—most notably Herbert Pack er in “The Limits of the Crim inal Sanction” — have shown that such victimless crimes place an enormous strain upon our legal resources. And the price we pay for our morals is even higher than the dilution of resources needed for more threatening offenses. Laws against gambling are the most important single con tributor to police corruption—at least since the original nur turer of organized crime, Pro hibition, was repealed. The death rate of pregnant women from abortion has dropped dra matically in those jurisdictions that have legalized abortion. And probably the most serious instance is that of the mari juana laws, which have turned almost half of our younger gen eration into criminals, facili tated the entry of many young people into the drug culture, made a joke of our drug‐educa tion programs, and imposed a host of other social costs on our society. Marijuana, too, provides the clearest example of the effect of morals legislation in distracting effort and attention from more serious crimes. In California, for instance, this past year there were 50,000 ar rests for possession of small amounts of the drug. The enormous drain on law enforcement time and energy caused by this number of cases —which amount to one‐fourth of the felony prosecutions in the state — is easy to see. One might well ask how many muggings, larcenies or burglar ies were perpetrated while po lice officers were busy with marijuana cases — and how many otherwise noncriminal marijuana users were intro duced in our jails to a culture which prizes far more heavy criminal involvement, and where heroin and LSD are almost freely available. What Fred Graham has done in “The Self‐Inflicted Wound” is to demonstrate for all who might be unconvinced of it that crime is an increasingly serious social problem; that blaming the Supreme Court is neither helpful nor accurate; and that our criminal law institutions are dangerously overloaded —in part, but only in part, be cause of a series of Supreme Court decisions. From there the conclusion is inescapable that, along with putting more re sources and intelligence into the criminal law, we must tailor our aspirations to our abilities both in how we enforce the laws and in what those laws forbid.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Women Assail French Births Policy,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/23/archives/women-assail-french-births-policy.html,"VERSAILLES, France, Nov. 22 — Defense Minister Michel Debit was hooted today when he told a convention of women that they had a duty to increase the birth rate.  The 325 women meeting here have been putting the emphasis on their rights to sexual free dom and equality. The conven tion, the States‐General of Women, which opened Friday, is sponsored by Elle, the most popular women's magazine in France. It was called to seek ways to improve the status of women in French society. Mr. Debre, who spoke on the closing day of the convention, is a leading Gaullist proponent of a population increase to maintain France as a major power. The reaction when he said that women had obliga tions as well as rights indicated at the least a lack of interest in Government efforts to fight against a declining birth rate. The Defense Minister said that the falling birth rate was “crucial to the future of the nation.” He pointed to the large number of Algerian and other foreign workers that France had been obliged to import and said that if the French birth rate re mained the same, the proportion of Algerians would increase. He Cites Soviet Policy He said that the Soviet Union had encouraged bigger families in fear that the disproportion between Chinese and Russians would become insoluble in 25 years. This did not appear to be a major concern of the women. They had just approved a re port calling for recognition of the right of all to sex education, for “total freedom of contracep tion, without discrimination, against minors, who need it most” and the right to abortion at least if there is a risk of an abnormal infant. A report read by Mrs. Michele, Grandjean of Arles noted that only 400,000 women used the contraceptive pill and that the more liberal legislation on con traceptives voted two years ago had not diminished the number of abortions. She said official figures indicated that 800,000 abortions were performed in. France every year but that the real figure was closer to 1.5 million or double the number of French births. A law passed in 1968 made contraception legal but forbade publicity for it and required a doctor's prescription. Mrs. Grandjean said the law had contributed to “a veritable lib eration.” But, she said, this liberation was limited by the attitude of the Roman Catholic Church and “by the attitude of the Government, which is pursuing a policy of population growth.” The French birth rate, which was low before for World War II, was increased just after the war by Government financial grants and by an upsurge in marriages. The birth rate is now beginning to slip again. In 1964 it was 18.1 for each 1,000 popu lation and is now estimated at 16.7, compared with a United States birth rate of 17.4 in 1968, the lowest ever recorded in the United States. The 1936 French birth rate was 14.6. The French Government has recently increased family grants as well as grants to pregnant mothers. But a poll taken in preparation of the convention here indicated the statistical average of 2.7 children as the number desirable by French women. This is not much dif ferent from the actual current average of 2.4. Frenchwomen who wished to work complained that they did not have the proper facilities. to carry on a double career as wage‐earners and mothers. The Government has tried to in crease the number of day‐care centers but these are still con sidered inadequate. The convention sessions have been rather sedate with the emphasis placed on reform rather than on revolution. Yes terday, however, a small group of young leftists representing a woman's liberation move ment invaded the convention hall and demanded the floor. A 20‐year‐old girl, who de clined to identify herself, declared that women now had the choice of working for smaller wages than those of men doing the same job or staying at home and “depend ing on your husband.” House work is not paid for, she pointed out and this appeared to arouse sympathy from her more conservative audience. The girl declared that women could count only on themselves to obtain justice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lincoln Hospital:,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/29/archives/lincoln-hospital-behind-the-conflict-over-the-pediatric-post.html,"Einstein Medical College, one of the nation's most prestigious medical schools, was created and is heavily supported by Jewish philanthropists. Yet this month it was widely accused of anti‐Semitism and last week its Dean's office was the scene of a protest sit‐in by members of the Jewish Defense League. And at the same time other Bronx groups were accusing the col lege of being racist and of dis criminating against blacks and Puerto Ricans.  The medical school's current troubles stem from its effort to help the 350,000 Puerto Ricans and blacks in the South Bronx ghetto by administering that area's chief source of medical care, Lincoln Hospital. The dif ficulties have arisen since mid‐ year because of the appearance at Lincoln of a group of radical young physicians who want ma jor changes there and elsewhere American society. Political Traps These developments are being watched closely by medical schools throughout the country which are under pressure to get similarly involved with medical care for the poor. The political booby traps that Einstein Medi cal College has encountered in the ghetto may cause others to hesitate about entering that arena. Moreover, the spread of social consciousness and radi calism among the nation's medi cal students and junior physi cians suggests that develop ments at Lincoln presage anala gous conflicts elsewhere in the medical system during the 1970's. Dr. Arnold Einhorn, a 46‐year‐ old physician, former under ground fighter against the Nazis and chief of pediatrics at Lin coln for the past three years, has been the focus of the dispute that has raged for two weeks. Reports that he was being re placed by a Puerto Rican physi cian, Dr. Helen Rodriguez, be cause of “political” and “ethnic” reasons set off a storm whose end is not yet in sight. Lincoln Hospital, an aged and shabby fortress‐like structure, is called a “dump” by many of its employes and patients. The community's resentment at the hospital's inadequacies have been expressed by repeated sit ins, protest demonstrations, and the creation of local organiza tions aimed at creating pressure for improvement. Einstein Medi cal College administers the hos pital for the city of New York under a contract aimed at using Einstein's superior physicians, residents and interns as a means of bringing competent doctors to Lincoln. Campaign Mounted In the last academic year some “socially conscious” or “radical” physicians—depend ing on one's point of view—at Einstein decided to use Lincoln to work for revolutionary changes in medical care. A national cam paign was mounted to recruit pediatric interns and residents “who are concerned with prac ticing medicine in such a way as to effect social change.” The aim was to concentrate a “criti cal mass” of such people in one hospital so they could have a massive impact there. Thus it was that Dr. Einhorn found himself early last July with a “pediatrics collective” on his hands, a group of bright, radical interns and residents, all of them white and many of them Jewish. Defying convention, they sported the abundant hair, bell bottom trousers, love beads and other symbols of the disaffected young, and began making plain they intended to practice a new kind of medicine. Even before July, their first month of work, was over, the collective had generated extreme tension. Veteran Filipino resi dents resigned after they were told they were “foreign mer cenaries” who had abandoned the pressing medical needs at home to learn how to take care of the children of rich Filipinos. Dr. Einhorn found his wishes and ideas disregarded by sub ordinates who seemed to think of him as a capitalist stooge and who sometimes made rounds without him. The pediatrics collective called for community control of Lincoln Hospital, for provision of regular, systematic pediatric care ‘for every child in the com munity. It also worked closely with the Young Lords and helped that organization start the furor last August about an alleged “murder” of an abortion patient, a charge that provoked a strike by the Lincoln obstet rical staff. With Dr. Einhorn plainly out of control of the pediatrics de partment, and the Medical Board—composed of chiefs of services at Lincoln—clamoring for the break up or ouster of the collective, Einstein's of ficials looked for a way out of the situation. They were spurred by Dr. Einhorn who told them he wanted to be transferred to an assignment outside Lincoln. He said he could not work with the collective and feared for his personal safety. In this atmosphere, Einstein's officials—headed by Dean Labe C. Scheinberg—were delighted to have a job application from 41‐year‐old Dr. Rodriguez, pediatrician with impeccable professional credentials and personality that indicated she could get along with the pedia trics collective. Einstein's officials saw the solution to their problem: The transfer of Dr. Einhorn, as he had requested, and his replace ment with Dr. Rodriguez. But Dr. Einhorn vacillated and com plained at times he was being forced out. Finally, however, Dean Scheinberg negotiated an agreement with Dr. Einhorn which, he thought, would se cure the desired results. But that agreement, at Dr. Einhorn's insistence, contained a reference to his being re placed for “political” and “eth nic” reasons. When that became public, it produced a storm of protest, especially from New York City's large Jewish popu lation which was already angry about what it viewed as the unjust removal of Jewish school principals to provide jobs for blacks and Puerto Ricans. Now, many Jews reasoned, the same process was beginning in medi cine. The explosion of anger af fected many of Einstein's finan cial supporters as well. Dean Hospitalized As the crisis intensified, Dean Scheinberg was hospital ized with bleeding ulcers, Jew ish organizations passed resolu tions of protest and the Jewish Defense League made its ap pearance at the medical school. For the officials concerned, the prime consideration was to end the furor before it produced a major confrontation between New York's Jews and its blacks and Puerto Ricans. In effect, top officials begged Dr. Einhorn to state his terms for a settlement that would end the general indignation. The outcome was an Einstein Col lege announcement that the pe diatrician was being reinstated. But before the announcement could exert a healing influence, it was learned that he was re turning only for two weeks, i.e. that no more than a face‐saving maneuver was involved. As the second week of crisis ended, Dr. Einhorn was in France on a brief vacation and it was uncertain whether he would return to Lincoln even for two weeks. And the hospi tal, its internal divisions still unresolved, remained a battle ground for contending forces, each striving for power and each conscious that the outcome may well set a model for ghetto medicine all over this country. —HARRY SCHWARTZ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Abortion Laws Gaining Favor As New Statutes Spur Debate,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/29/archives/abortion-laws-gaining-favor-as-new-statutes-spur-debate.html,"A dramatic liberalization of public attitudes and practices regarding abortions appoars to be sweeping the country, even in a number of states that still have restrictive abortion laws.  The change in the way Amer icans view abortions can be seen in the tremendous increase in legal abortions in this coun try, the growing participation of clergymen as prime movers in abortion reform and referral and the increasingly liberal in terpretation of existing state laws by the medical profession. Earlier this month, in the first instance in which a liberal abortion law was put to a pub lic referendum, 55.5 per cent of voters in the State of Wash ington favored an eased law that leaves the decision to have an abortion up to the woman and her physician. As abortion laws and atti tudes relax, more and more doctors and hospitals are doing abortions. Dr. Christopher Tietze of the Population Coun cil estimates that as many as 200,000 legal abortions will be performed in the United States this year, compared with about 18,000 just two years ago. The new view of abortions reflects the combined action of many social forces, among them a growing concern with over population, increasing demands for women's rights and roles outside the home, rising wel fare rolls and illegitimacy rates, growing numbers of child abuse and child neglect cases and a general easing of sexual pro scriptions. Perhaps the most important liberalizing force has been the recent relaxation of restrictive abortion laws in 16 states and the publicity that surround these legal changes. As one observer of the abor tion scene remarked recently, “People tend to equate illegality with immorality; when abortion is no longer illegal, the stigma of immorality tends to fall away.” Reports from around the country this month revealed that fewer and fewer people tend to regard abortion as start ing with a red letter “A.” In some cases, in fact, the tra ditional hard‐line opposition to abortion appears to be declin ing among Roman Catholics, laymen and clergy alike. “A liberal abortion law shows a mature attitude of ‘society,” said Mrs. Myrtle Carr, a Portland, Ore. mother of one. “I used to feel Ore., it was mor ally wrong to have an abortion —sinful, but I have read more on it, thought more about it.” Mrs. Q. Kenneth Bogaard, a middle‐aged mother of two grown sons in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, remarked: “My attitude has changed over the last three years because of increasing published material presenting new information and the other side of the argument. I have misgivings about making abor tions too easy for unwed moth ers but I prefer this to the clandestine ‘coat hanger’ opera tion in back rooms by unskilled, unscrupulous operators.” Opponents Shift Views Even among people who dis approve of abortions, many are broadening their views: As West Coast father of two said, “Morally, I've thought abortion is wrong and I still do, but there are too many people for the bread that is available.” In Madison, Wis., several women made comments similar to this housewife: “I wouldn't have one myself, but if some one else wants to, why shouldn't they be able to?” Although the Roman Catho lic Church remains firmly op posed to abortions, the com ments of the Rev. Carl Lezak, associate pastor of St. Sebas tian's Roman Catholic Church in Chicago, were typical of a small but growing number of Catholic clergymen: “I'm not taking any public position on the morality of abortion. I'm saying we ought to get out of legislating public morality in private matters. I'm certain there has been a great swing among Catholics toward favoring abortion reform.” One of those Catholics is Mrs. Arnold Geiger, a 26‐year‐ old mother from Anchorage, Alaska. She said she had op posed abortions “as a matter of religious philosophy,” but that recently her view has changed. “I find there's more to baby than having it—like sup porting it, caring for it,” she remarked. “I don't think adop tion agencies are solving the problem of unwanted children. There's still too many kids around that aren't wanted.” Exceptions Are Asked In Pittsburgh, where several Catholic physicians were re ported doing abortions, Dr. Rose Middleman, medical co ordinator of the Planned Parent hood center, said, “Quite often patients will say ‘I'm Catholic but I feel I have to have this abortion,’ or ‘I'm Catholic but I don't agree with my church on abortion.’” In the meantime, non‐Catholic clergymen throughout the coun try are becoming increasingly active in the movement toward liberal abortion laws. There are now 28 Clergy Consultation Services on Abortion in 22 states, compared with just 11 eight months ago.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Abortions:,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/29/archives/abortions-the-dire-forecasts-have-not-been-borne-out.html,"When New York's legal abor tion program went into effect July 1, it was accompanied by a host of dire predictions. Many observers warned of massive resistance on the part of doc tors and hospitals and an un controllable deluge of abortion patients from othcr states. The implementation of the new law, they said, would be frustrated by high costs, lack of service to the poor, general administra tive chaos— all leading, even tually, to a return to the quacks.  Last week Gordon Chase, ad ministrator of the city's Health Services Administration, pre sented impressive evidence that the nay‐sayers had been mis taken. In the first four months under the new law, which allows abor tions to be performed on mutual consent between a woman and her physician, some 50,000 abor tions were performed in hospi tals and special clinics through out the city. “While there will inevitably be problems in implementing any new massive program,” Mr. Chase said, “and while we must continue to watch the situation closely, the system seems to be meeting demand fairly smoothly.” Much of the program's suc cess to date reflects the way the medical leadership in the city —and particularly the munici pal hospital system—responded to the challenge of the new law. “We worked like hell to try to prepare for what was ahead,” Mr. Chase said. “We realized that the fate of liberal abortion laws throughout the country de pended to a great extent on how well New York handled its new law.” The administration had the support of doctors who staffed the municipal hospital system, which has done more than 10, 000 abortions, mostly on in digent women under the new law. Doctors in city hospitals, who in the past have treated thousands of victims of illegally induced abortions each year and delivered many more thousands of unwanted babies to unwed mothers, were willing to do as many abortions as need be to improve the quality of life among the poor. Moreover, the mass of phy sicians—many of whom had re sisted the idea of performing abortions — changed their atti tudes once they came face‐to face with women requesting abortions. As one doctor said, “I realize now that just about every woman who wants an abortion has a good reason for wanting it.” The growth of specially equipped abortion clinics has also been a major factor, saving the hospitals from the full brunt of the program. Three of the clinics now operating performed a total of nearly 12,000 abortions during the first four months of the new law. According to city health officials, three more clinics that meet the Board of Health requirements for inde pendent abortion facilities are now in the planning stages. One measure of the program's success has been the relatively low and steadily declining in cidence of complications related to the procedure. The five abor tion‐related deaths that have oc curred under known auspices since July 1 represents a death rate of 10 per 100,000 — far below the death rate dUring the first year of liberal abortion laws in Britain and Scandinavia and a third of the death rate associated with pregnancy and childbirth. However, some difficulties still remained. Critics charged last week that many women still have to wait three weeks or more and that this wait often results in the need for a more complicated and expensive abortion. The Rev. Howard Moody, past or of Judson Memorial Church and director of the Clergy and Lay Advocates for Hospital Abortion Performance, said “there are still instances of poor women being told they have to pay for their abortion in ad vance, there is still much con fusion and lack of communica tion, there are still women being shuttled from one hospital to an other to yet another, there are still many instances where the hospitals fail to use the city's clearinghouse so that a woman doesn't have to wait around for weeks.” —JANE E.

CHURCHES JOINING IN ‘BLACK STUDIES’,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/29/archives/churches-joining-in-black-studies-chicagoans-to-publish-new-sunday.html,"CHICAGO, Nov. 28. — The Good Samaritan wears his hair Afro style and drives a Mus tang.  The youth, who, according to the Bible, “wasted his sub stance with riotous living,” is now depicted as one for whom “the name of the game [was] eating, drinking, ‘blowing his mind’ and •getting ‘stoned’.” Such license with the Scrip tures is typical of a new line of Sunday school materials that has been developed here pri marily for black urban teen agers. Borrowing from a trend al ready evident in many public school texts and in a nation wide movement for emphasis on so‐called “Black Studies” in education, the Chicago Sunday school lessons seek to relate Bi ble stories to city problems— from abortions to street gangs. Black faces dominate the illus trations. Biblical tales are in terspersed with features on black history. The materials will be intro duced in January by Urban Ministries, Inc., an eight‐month‐ old black organization whose founders hope the materials will help stem what they con sider to be an exodus of black youths from the churches. Statistics about the alleged exodus are scarce, but the Rev. Melvin E. Banks, president of Urban Ministries, said he be came aware of it both in his ministry and in his job as distributor for a white‐owned publishing house that printed religious literature. In the churches, he said, “No one talked about the prob lems that mattered, like black identity, drugs and sex. So the kids had to go somewhere else.” As for religious texts, he said, “the average publisher produces materials geared for the suburbs. When you open the pages you see nothing but white faces.” Mr. Banks got financing for his new texts project from his old company, Scripture Press, but insisted that “we need a black ‐ controlled company, be cause when whites are there, they want to run the show.” He said his fledgling com pany would seek to help black youths in their quest for iden tity. “We are telling black kids that they don't have to be white. That they don't have to give up who they are in order to be somebody,” he said. Yet the company calls its publications “interracial” and hopes that churches, white or black and of all denominations, in both the city and suburbs, will use them. “The trouble is that white people assume the books are intended just for blacks unless most of the faces in them are white,” Mr. Banks said. His Sunday school texts would have a strong activist flavor, Mr. Banks said. “Follow ing in Christ's footsteps means acting against discrimination and exploitation, even at the risk of being tagged a social Gospeler by the conservatives.” This stance represents a change from the conservative theological education Mr. Banks received at Chicago's funda mentalist Moody Bible Institute and at the nearby nonsectarian ministerial school, Wheaton College. “Six years of living in the black community convinced me that a theology which leads you to ignore the problems you find there must be wrong,” he said. “So I went back to the Bible and found out how much my ministers had bypassed. They told me that Jesus performed miracles like feeding the multi tudes in order to prove his di vinity. It never hit me then that He fed those folks because they, were hungry.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JEWISH STUDENTS FOUND CONCERNED,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/12/04/archives/jewish-students-found-concerned-study-cites-commitment-to-solving.html,"By IRVING SPIEGELHOUSTON, Dec. 3—Jewish college freshmen are more com mitted to resolving social prob lems and more concerned with limitations on their personal autonomy than are their fellow non‐Jewish students, a compre hensive study released here to day indicated.  The survey of 170,000 college freshmen, both Jews and non Jews, was conducted by the American Council on Education. The study, made public by the American Jewish Committee was based on interviews with students on campuses of all sizes throughout the country.

Issue of Poverty The study showed that 91 per cent of the Jewish students favored a greater Federal role in eliminating poverty as against 77.3 per cent of the non Jews. Further, it showed that 72.6 per cent of the Jewish students favored Government desegregation of schools as against 52.5 per ce, of the non‐Jews. Differences were also noted in respect to liberalizing divorce laws (favored by 59.4 eper cent of Jewish students and 36.4 per cent of the non‐Jews), legalization of marijuana (51.9 per cent of the Jews, 24 per cent of the non‐Jews) and more Federal control over fire anns(79 per cent of the Jews and 47.4 per cent of the non‐Jews).

Health Insurance Abortion Aid Urged,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/12/06/archives/health-insurance-abortion-aid-urged.html,"A City University authority on public health is urging broadening of health insurance to ease access to abortions. The authority, Prof. Charlotte F. Muller, contends “it can be argued that public interest in reduction of poverty is served in minimizing all financial bar riers to the prevention of un wanted births.” She predicted that court or legislative action would soon increase the poten tial for abortions in “most states.” Dr. Muller is on the staff of the Center for Social Research of the City University Graduate Division and is a past president of the Public Health Association of New York City. Basis for Estimates She has calculated a potential rate of 28.9 abortions for each 1,000 women in the child‐bear ing ages of 15 to 44 as a basis for insurance estimates. This would indicate 1,165,575 abor tions a year throughout the United States. The estimates included 20.02 abortions for each 1,000 white women in these age groups, 96.83 for nonwhite women. Dr. Muller's survey of health insurance for abortion costs has been published by Planned Parenthood ‐ World Population, in its Family Planning Perspec tives. Eleven of 12 leading com mercial insurance companies, she reported, cover abortion in their group contracts now, but generally with restrictions. For example, single women may not be protected, benefits may be restricted to a hospital case and payments may be less than current charges. Among nonprofit Blue Cross hospital plans studied, 20 pro vide for abortion coverage and three exclude it, Dr. Muller re ported. Among Blue Shield medical plans, 51 cover abor tions, and four exclude them. For Single Women The New York City Blue Cross Plan, Dr. Muller said, ex tended abortion coverage in June to single women and un married dependent children in families in community‐rated contracts. A similar benefit was offered to experience‐rated groups on purchase of a special rider. The Blue Shield Plan in New York, Dr. Muller said, extended abortion coverage to include service in nonhospital facilities and physicians’ offices meeting Board of Health criteria. New York State's elective abortion law took effect July‐ 1. Dr. Muller suggested that model plan for abortion insur ance specify the coverage. eliminate a waiting period, pro vide benefits both in and out of hospitals, and include “for rea sons of social policy, spreading the cost over an entire group, rather than leaving large out of ‐ pocket expense to the patient.” “The view sometimes stated to justify waiting periods with respect to delivery, namely, that the insurance mechanism is misused when it finances a planned event, would surely not apply to the unwanted pregnancy,” Dr. Muller wrote.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Burger/Blackmun Court,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/12/06/archives/the-burgerblackmun-court-the-burgerblackmun-court.html,"Chief Justice Warren Burger James Reston has described Warren Burger, rather depressingly, as “middle‐class, middle‐aged, middle of‐the‐road, Middle Western.” Burger, the boyhood pal with whom the new man on the Court, Justice Blackmun, can now walk to work, probably must call upon Chief Justice William Howard Taft, another Middle West erner, as his mentor. Like Taft, Burger, in the short time he has been on the Court, has seemed to relish the role of efficient and all‐encom passing administrator and lobbyist for judicial reforms. He has ex pended hours and energy getting silver water goblets and more law clerks for his brethren; last August, he presented a “State of the Judi ciary” message at the American Bar Association's convention and he would like to do the same thing before annual joint sessions of the Congress; he has been lobbying for streamlined procedures to produce speedier trials. Burger has frankly conceded that he spends more time on these activities than he does on deciding cases, a circumstance that is not altogether to be deplored and which may stem in large part from the fact that his predecessor was not an orderly court administrator. Again unlike Earl Warren, the cur rent Chief—he is the 15th in the Court's 181‐year history — appears disinclined to work vigorously for voting “bloc” on the Court. Thus, far, Burger has contented himself with sharp‐tongued dissents in those few cases that have carried forward the more egalitarian notions of the Warren Court. If there was any discernible thread running through the major opinions written or joined in by the new Chief Justice during the 1969‐70 term, it would have to be described as a reluctance to move much beyond the Warren Court, particularly in the areas of criminal procedure and pornography. This accounts for Yale Law Professor Alexander Bickel's reference to the past Court term as “the year of the pause.” But “pause” implies an inter ruption of forward movement that is only temporary. Neither Richard Nixon nor Warren Burger had that in mind. Someone with a nasty descriptive knack once said that Jack Arm strong, the All‐American Boy, was modeled after Byron R. White. The remark was inspired by the circum stance that Justice White, all his life, has been good at whatever he sets his hands and brain to—in his stu dent days he was a great football player while getting himself elected to Phi Beta Kappa and an editorship of the Yale Law Journal; he was a Rhodes Scholar; before going on the Court he was a proficient practitioner of the law. He is exactly the sort of man who would have been John Ken nedy's friend, and that is what Byron White was. White is a man of great personal reserve but he has his en thusiasms. (I recall a dinner party in Chicago to which White contributed almost no conversation until George Hain of the Bears football team showed up. “Whizzer” White and Halas talked football into the follow ing morning.) Justice White has not been the activist that Kennedy may have thought he was putting on the Court but he has been a thoughtful moderate on a tribunal that already had its share of pragmatic reformers. Thurgood Marshall, with the advent of Blackmun no longer the junior Justice, is the first black man to sit on the Supreme Court. He stood in front of it often enough in his triumphant days as counsel to the N.A.A.C.P. Marshall is so disingenu ous, so genial, so quick to tell a good story or to laugh at yours, that some may think him the Court's light weight. (Shortly after Marshall had been appointed Solicitor General of the United States I spent about an hour in the company of him and Chicago politician who was under the misapprehension that the backslap ping, wisecracking, cigar‐chewing Marshall was a South Side alderman. Marshall never disabused the man.) In fact, any assessment that Justice Marshall is not a contributive mem ber of his Court would be seriously mistaken. He has a disarming knack for putting the most penetrating questions in a seemingly simple way. It disembowels lawyers. During oral argument on the constitutionality of requiring paupers to work off their fines in prison, for example, Justice Marshall—in his slow, laconic way— persistently inquired, “As I under stand the State of Illinois's argument here, it is that the poor man goes to jail and the rich man goes free. Now, that's it, isn't it?” It was. And Mar shall had demonstrated once again that he will be the poor man's cham pion on the Court. The Court's eccentric is William O. Douglas. Everyone, of course, knows everything about Douglas, much of it irrelevant to his worth as a jurist. Spiro T. Agnew would unhesitatingly brand him a radical liberal. It would probably flabber gast the Vice President to know that Douglas is a strict constructionist. Douglas, in other words, is always willing to insist that the Constitution means what it says. This is why William Van Alstyne of Duke Univer sity's Law School is at once artful and profound in commenting that “Mr. Justice Douglas has a very rugged Constitution.” But some ob servers would add their lament that Douglas will not take the time to write better opinions. William 0. Douglas is that unpleasing combina tion, a lazy legal genius. “Justice Harry A. Blackmun will turn out to be much more of a strict con structionist in criminal matters than his followers anticipated.” This un hesitating selection of a label for the newest member of the Supreme Court was made not by a President or law professor but by Jeane Dixon, the well‐known psychic, and may be as deserving of credit as any other. There are not many solid clues to the riddle of how Blackmun will con duct himself. Sixty‐two years old, he is a man with no apparent craving for the public's applause. His com mitment to a seven‐day workweek may compensate for the fact that his mind does not dart and soar so rapidly as that of a Holmes or Cardozo. After more than 10 years on a lower Federal appeals court, he approaches the nation's highest Court with an attitude not much short of reverence, which is precisely as it should be. He has been a lifelong friend of Chief Justice Burger but there is no reason to distrust his in sistence that he can disagree with him. He is a White Anglo‐Saxon Protestant Republican Rotarian Har vard Man from the Suburbs—and as a lower court judge he decided many a case in favor of disadvantaged members, young and old, of minority groups. He is deeply concerned about the legitimacy of the death penalty; he is at the same time bothered by present‐day permissiveness (he recent ly employed that phrase in an opin ion) and the breakdown of law en forcement. In all the words he has written and spoken over the years, only one offhand and almost lost com ment promises anything explicit about his behavior on the Supreme Court. Not so long ago Harry Blackmun said that he supposed he had been “brought up in the Felix Frankfurter tradition.” That remark rang bells. For Frankfurter devoted a long life and a superb mind to the meticulous working out of a philosophy that is summed up, much too simply, in the phrase, judicial restraint—and judicial re straint is the brother‐in‐law of what Richard Nixon seems to mean by “strict constructionism.” Hugo L. Black, appointed in 1937, is the Court's senior member in point both of age and service. His nomina tion to the Court touched off debate as acrimonious as that surrounding G. Harrold Carswell's. Black had had little better than a bad high school education and his brief dalliance with the Alabama Ku Klux Klan was resurrected by enemies who neglected to mention that he had been superb trial lawyer and a valuable member of the U.S. Senate. He has, late in life, occasionally abandoned the consistency he so often extolls; he is growing increasingly conserva tive and uncharacteristically testy. But this courtly Southern gentleman has been an important shaper of constitutional law. History will rec ord him as one of the great Supreme Justices. William Brennan is the Court's most indefatigable worker. Professor Vince Blasi of the University of Texas has dubbed him “The Most Valuable Player of the Era.” During the hectic Warren years Brennan could often be detected as the architect of some. times jerry‐built coalitions that pro duced some of that period's fragile five‐man opinions. The fact that these opinions were sometimes inter nally inconsistent annoyed perfec tionists, yet Brennan is a patient and painstaking legal technician of whom John P. Frank, a knowledgeable Su preme Court practitioner, has said, “This is no man for a quick thrust to a foreordained result. . . . The process of his reasoning is likely to be intricate and detailed.” He is per haps the most libertarian of the Potter Stewart is Justice Harlan's Midwestern counterpart; he went to the Hotchkiss School and, in ac cordance with the Unwritten Law at that prestigious New England pre paratory institution, proceeded forth with to Yale. He comes of conserva tive Ohio stock—Senator Robert A. Taft smiled upon him, at least until he supported Dwight D. Eisenhower for the Presidency—and he was an accomplished lawyer with a well regarded Cincinnati firm. And yet Stewart is one of the Court's most unpredictable members. He is the only Justice with a passable prose style and he uses it, every once in a while, to announce important and unexpected doctrinal advances which, however spectacular, are nonetheless wholly in accord with notions of ordered liberty. The background of Justice John Marshall Harlan contrasts most sharply with Hugo Black's. It in cludes fancy Eastern prep schools, Princeton, a Rhodes scholarship and a lush Wall Street law practice. A splendidly polished lawyer, he is the intellectual heir of Felix Frankfurter, although, because on the bench he is less snappish than Frankfurter was, he has been referred to as “Frankfurter without the mustard.” He and .Justice Blackmun can be ex pected to get on together nicely as they practice Frankfurter's brand of judicial restraint.—J.R.W. THE temptation to affix neatly lettered tags to Supreme Court Justices is strong. Some times it is justifiable. After all, mankind is almost irresistibly political and moralistic. No Supreme Court Justice abandons his moral political outlook simply because some Presi dent has put him on the bench. He will remain conservative, moderate, liberal or, conceivably, radical in his personal attitudes toward at least those larger issues that delineate every man's conception of government's rightful role. The question then arises, will his moral‐political predilections seep into his judicial opinions? As to some Justices, the inevitable answer is sometimes. Obviously, a Justice's political coloration is likely to be distinguishable, if it is distinguishable at all, only in those cases com ing before him that have potent political rami fications; not disreputable men, Holmes and Frankfurter among them, have said that con stitutional law is applied politics. Other sorts of cases will be decided on more nearly “pure” legalistic grounds. For example, the fact that William 0. Douglas, politically speaking, is nonstop liberal can hardly be sensed from his bankruptcy decisions, and it is not likely that Warren Burger's innate, almost emotional con servatism will ever be noted in any patent case that he may someday write about officially. The fact emphatically remains that, while de precating the assignment of political‐sounding labels to the Justices is fashionable with those who wish either to intellectualize the Court or to get on it, the labels sometimes fit quite well. (Certainly President Nixon is banking on his There is only one sort of man who can come close to keeping the pettier of his political inclinations from coloring his judicial attitudes.      ing the last term: political and sub versive cases. By way of illustration, the riot conspiracy trial of the “Chi cago Seven,” the essential nature of which J. Anthony Lukas somehow managed to distill in his recent book, “The Barnyard Epithet and Other Ob scenities,” probably presents an ex ample of both categories rolled into one preposterous litigation. The pros ecution of David Dellinger et al. was a political one; some of the defend ants sought to subvert the judicial process. In some future term, un happily, such cases may constitute the bulk of the Supreme Court's hear ing calendar. Everyone, lawyers and laymen alike, has been interested in the emotion‐charged issues of school bus ing, the death penalty, the fate of “I Am Curious (Yellow),” and the constitutionality of committing com bat forces to Vietnam without a Con gressional declaration of war. There may even be those who care greatly about the legal propriety of display ing sculptor Marc MorreH's concep tion of the American flag as a penis. It is actually fairly easy to predict Court coalitions in these cases. To pick two examples, we know that Chief Justice Burger and Justice Blackmun are unlikely to favor thrusting their Court into the con troversy swirling around the execu tive branch's war‐making experi ments in Southeast Asia. They are almost certain to say that the Viet nam war cases raise “political ques  Last term's Court was split four to four tions” beyond the judiciary's reach. In fact, only William 0. Douglas and Potter Stewart have demonstrated any real willingness to get into this exceedingly sensitive area. (Justice Harlan has recently indicated for the first time that he would be willing to hear such a case.) To take a second example, we can be reasonably sure that the conservative bloc will fail in any effort to return to the states an unbridled power to regulate the distribution of pornography. With Burger, Harlan and Blackmun dis senting, the majority of the Court will continue to ask the questions first posed three years ago in Redrup v. New York. If the state statute in question does not reflect “a . . . con cern for juveniles,” if there was no “suggestion of an assault upon in dividual privacy by publication in a manner so obtrusive as to make it impossible for an unwilling individual to avoid exposure to [the pornograph ic matter],” and if there was no evi dence of “pandering” publicity, any obscenity conviction will be over turned. SOME of the less widely advertised issues to confront the Supreme Court this term are likely to have a more pervasive influence on the lives of Americans. The testing of the 1970 Voting Rights Act is a good example. A decision that Congress has the con stitutional authority to set 18 as the legal voting age throughout the na tion would enfranchise almost 10 mil lion people. If the Court upholds the act's ban on .literacy tests, as many as two million voters might be added to the rolls in 13 states. Favorable rulings on the act's residence and ab sentee‐voter provisions would qualify another 10 million voters. A deter mination that the District of Colum bia's abortion law is unconstitutional ly vague may hasten the enactment of more abortion‐on‐request statutes of the type now on the books in Hawaii and New York. In another case of genuine and general impor tance the Court is called upon to hold that the continued maintenance of arrest and identification records vio lates an accused's First Amendment right of privacy if he is subsequently acquitted, the case against him is dismissed, or the statute under which he was arrested is voided on con stitutional grounds. Additional cases that have not at tracted widespread attention but which are well calculated to mark out emerging voting patterns on the Bur ger Court include two that challenge New York's criminal anarchy statute as being couched in dragnet language. (The statute criminalizes anyone who “advocates the overthrow of the ex isting form of government of this state by violence, or . . . publishes, sells or distributes any document which advocates such violent over throw, or . . . becomes a member of any organization which advocates such violent overthrow.”) Last term's eight‐man Court restored these cases to its calendar for reargument during the present term, once again indicat ing that the Court was split down the middle. Justice Blackmun will now provide the swing vote and it is safe prediction that he will join with the Chief Justice and Associate Jus tices Harlan, Stewart and White in upholding the statute, especially since the distinguished New York Court of Appeals, giving it a narrow interpre tation, has already done so. They will first listen to arguments that these old laws—California's is also under legal attack this term—must be pre served for use against the S.D.S., P.L.P., Black Panthers and, for bal ance, the Minutemen and whatever remains of the American Nazi party. ,ANOTHER intriguing pair of cases involves Florida's vagrancy statute, which interdicts 21 kinds of vagrancy, including “wandering or strolling around from place to place without any lawful purpose or object,” and Texas's, which punishes as vagrants “companies of gypsies” and all those who are “known as tramps.” Lower Federal courts have condemned such statutes and it is not unlikely that William 0. Douglas, the friend of all wanderers and strollers, tramps and gypsies, will write a unanimous Supreme Court opinion holding like wise. And either Douglas or Black would be a natural selection to write the decision striking down the Mont gomery, Ala. loitering ordinances as they were applied to the 1965 Free dom Walkers. It is possible that the entire Court can agree that these ordinances are so vague and other wise restrictive of First Amendment rights as to be unconstitional. .Here the law is clear enough to bring con servative and liberal together. The cast of Palmer v. Thompson will reveal whether the Burger Court is going to lose momentum in the area of racial desegregation. The case comes up from Jackson, Miss., which in 1963 was ordered to desegregate its public swimming pools. The city's re sponse was to close the pools, claim ing that they could not be safely or economically operated on an inte grated basis. A lower Federal appel late court, over powerful dissents,  held that maintenance of swimming pools is a nonessential service that a city can discontinue at will. The lower court's opinion tiptoes past the history of swimming‐pool operation in Jackson and does not come to grips with the issue of racially moti vated governmental action. A ma jority of the Supreme Court, very pos sibly including not only Blackmun but Burger as well, will overrule Palmer, saying that neither economics nor public safety can justify its hold There is on the Court's docket case that is probably dear to the hearts of the Women's Liberation Movement. The.Martin Marietta Cor poration refused to hire females with school‐age children but freely em ployed men with youngsters of that age. It can be argued that this alone established sex discrimination under the 1965 Civil Rights Act—in law yers’ jargon, that it constituted a per se violation—but a conservative ma jority of the Court is not likely to say so; instead, it will insist that additional factors must be considered on a case‐by‐case basis to determine whether sex was the sole criterion for a job turn‐down. An important • voting case arises from. Indiana, which was enjoined from conducting 1970 elections under a legislative districting system that violated the Warren Court's one‐man, one‐vote prescription. A Federal trial court abolished multimember districts and tried to maintain the geographi cal integrity of black ghetto areas. The question is whether multimember districts deny ghetto residents the equal protection of the laws, since they may dilute the elective power of any minority group in the district. However, five or more Justices, mind ful of Felix Frankfurter's fear that the Court was plunging into a “political thicket,” may decide that both types of districts are capable of ensuring one man, one vote, the decision as to which form to adopt being too patently political for the Court to touch. One case on the Court's docket raises the sensitive question of whether what are somewhat euphe mistical1y termed “home visits” by welfare officials constitute “searches” within the Fourth Amendment's meaning. New York welfare statutes require welfare agents to deny, reduce or terminate aid for dependent children to recipients who refuse con sent for home visits. These visits are not made under a search warrant but are made in accordance with pre scheduled appointments. Although a lower court found the statutes uncon stitutional, a conservative majority of the Supreme Court may take different view, declaring them a rea sonable regulation tied to the grant of welfare benefits. N an economically significant North Carolina case a group of black employes is complaining about the Duke Power Company's promotion and transfer policies, which demand the passing of a general intelligence and mechanical ability test that is in no way job‐related. These men argue that Duke's testing program, which locks them into the lowest paid jobs, perpetuates the company's past discriminatory hiring and pro motion patterns. (Until 1966, no black man had ever been anything but a laborer for Duke; since that year a grand total of four black men have managed to secure “inside” jobs.) The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, charged with adminis tering the job‐discrimination prohi bitions of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, supports the employes’ view but a Federal appellate court ruled that em ployment tests need not be job‐re lated so Icing as they are profession ally designed. Judge Simon Sobeloff, one of the country's most highly regarded jurists, filed a long and careful dissent that goes behind the tests themselves and traces their civil‐rights implications. Sobeloff would hold that the 1964 act bans job “freeze‐outs” where the freeze is achieved by means that are arbitrary and have no real business justifica tion. His analysis comports with the Supreme Court's past thinking in re lated civil‐rights areas; a majority of the Court, including Justice Black mun, will probably turn Sobeloff's dissent into binding law. (The same majority will strike down the State of Washington's English literacy re quirement as it is applied to Spanish. A case from California will also demonstrate that the present Court still has some forward civil‐rights mo mentum. In that case all but one member of the Court will vote to strike down Article 38 of the Califor nia Constitution, a fairly transparent prescript which requires that the con struction of low‐rent housing projects must be approved by a public refer endum. The Court will cite an opin ion, written only last year by Justice White, in which every Justice except Hugo Black condemned an Akron, Ohio, ordinance that required a ref erendum procedure before any fair housing ordinance could be enacted in that city. Justice Black (the strict constructionist) can be expected to repeat his warning that “. . . the Court needs to control itself, and not, as it is doing, encroach on state's powers . . . THE 1969‐70 Supreme Court term was marked, as I have said, by no ticeable judicial forbearance. Corrobo ration of the widely held thesis that the Burger Court will embrace Felix Frankfurter's brand of judicial re straint—that it will avoid the bold confrontations that characterized the Warren Court—may be detectable in the Court's disposition of several cases on its 1970‐71 docket. There are only two ways in which the Court can duck explosive issues. It can, in most instances, simply refuse to hear the case at all. Or it can take the case and then decide it on the narrowest possible ground, skirting its more controversial aspects. The latter ap proach, elevated to an art by Justice Frankfurter, was actually formulated by an earlier Justice whose name has not been written large on the pages of history. Late in the 19th century, Mr. Justice Stanley Mat thews, a former railroad attorney who had once been rejected by the Senate because of his ultra‐Establish ent clientele, declared that the Su preme Court should be bound rigidly by one cardinal rule: “. .. never to anticipate a question of constitution al law in advance of the necessity of deciding it . . . .” Two cases on the current docket are noticeably susceptible to the Matthews‐Frankfurter treatment. In the first, the National Association of Letter Carriers has assailed the stat ute that bars from Federal employ ment anyone who belongs to an or ganization which, to . his knowledge, asserts a right to strike against the Government. There is one flaw in the union's lawsuit. The statute has ap parently never been applied by the Government to prohibit anyone's em ployment. The Supreme Court agreed to hear this case but it now may do no more than decide that the peti tioners have failed to present what in the lexicon of lawyers is called “a justiciable case or controversy.” A pending obscenity case can be dis posed of in like fashion when the Court answers the question whether a person importing pornography for commercial distribution has standing to challenge a statute which, among its several aims, prohibits the impor tation of pornography for private consumption. Although what has been termed “outcome prediction” is a part of the lawyer's art as well as one of the games he plays, it has repeatedly been demonstrated, despite every thing I have said here, that no art short of necromancy will invariably suffice to predict how individual Su preme Court Justices will react to particular cases in particular times. In the last analysis, the focus of all who care about the appropriate func tioning of the least democratic branch of government must be upon the processes of appointment to it. Those processes must have as the desired end the selection of men and women possessing that essential morality, the true liberalism, which Prof. Paul Freund, one of the keenest of Court watchers, once reduced to four prin cipal manifestations: (1) an insistence on knowledge as indispensable to judging; (2) rejection of opportunism; (3) an insistence on jurisdictional and procedural observances, and (4) re jection of sentimentality. Freund was describing Mr. Justice Louis D. Bran deis. He was not talking about G. Harrold Carswell. But time may tell that his words can fittingly be ap plied to the man who for years to come will stand at the pivot of the Supreme Court. Not Warren E. ■  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
An old grad returns to Bayonne High School for his tenth reunion and finds he is,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/12/06/archives/an-old-grad-returns-to-bayonne-high-school-for-his-tenth-reunion-an.html,"WHEN I decided at the last minute to go to my 10th high school reunion, I tried to find the girl whose name was on the invi tation. She wasn't listed in the phone book, so I called somebody with the same last name and asked for help. “I don't know a Marie Sestito,” said the girl who answered, “but I'll ask my mother‐in‐law, she knows her.” told the girl not to go to so much trouble. “That's all right,” she said. “My mother‐in‐law lives upstairs.” square miles, and land is so scarce that they are building houses in swamps and next to sewage plants. But even the new brick boxes some how look weathered. It is a close‐knit town, rather iso lated and parochial, Eastern, ethnic and industrial, the kind of town where one's in‐laws are likely to live upstairs. I would be surprised if there are a dozen couples in all of Southern California, where I now live, who share a two‐family house with one partner's parents. The old folks are back in Queens or Cleveland or maybe Sun City, and besides, a two family house in California is practi cally a historic landmark. AWEEK after the phone call, I was landing at Newark Airport on one of those deceptively sunny fall days that leave a chilly aftertaste. I saw Bayonne clearly, a key‐shaped peninsula on the west side of New York Harbor. It is so close to the city that my twin brother and I could see the Statue of Liberty from the window of the bedroom we once shared. As the plane made its ap proach, consumptive smokestacks coughed noxious chemicals into the bleary sky. Grime caked bridges, fac tories and homes. The tanks from the oil refineries, long the town's major industry, looked like giant, rusty checkers. Newark Bay‐ itself seemed corroded. To call it a body of water would be to stretch the definition of water considerably. When some peo ple think of home they remember tree‐shaded streets or a particular park or maybe a river. I think of the soot of Bayonne and its smell, an aromatic combination of barbequed garbage and smoldering inner tubes, with a dash of sulphur for tanginess. One of my fellow passengers was a middle‐aged woman with carefully set black hair and multi‐colored sparkles on her eyeglass frames. As she deplaned she was met by two teen‐age girls. One wore curlers in her hair and a purple jacket with legend on the back announcing that she was a high‐school cheerleader. The other was a nun, in full habit. (No new‐style nuns here. In this part of New Jersey, ecumenicism means that the Irish now speak to the Italians.) The girls symbolized two of the area's principal cultures. Sports is practically the highest calling a youth can have—not sissy games like ten nis or chic ones like pro football, but such sweaty, traditional sports as baseball, bowling and, above all, basketball. If Bayonne has a heart beat, it is the thump of a basketball   “We're scared whether we're going to make it. We believe in the new ideas, but we don't know whether we can live with them.” being dribbled on concrete by a 12‐year‐old boy. Making the high school varsity is like being admitted to a pantheon of ineffable greatness. Your picture was enshrined on the dusty wall of a school corridor, your name chiseled into the base of brass‐plated trophy. You had torn tiny shred of immortality from the sweat shirt of history. And Bayonne is about 80 per cent Roman Catholic — mainly Irish, Ital ians, Poles and other Slavic groups. Many families settled there soon after arriving from the old country. They kept to their own enclaves, their own churches, and modernity made sur prisingly few inroads, at least until recently. One of the great tests for a young newspaperman there was to write a Polish obituary and spell all the names right. The priests were extremely powerful, if for no other reason than that they had an educa tion. When I was a teen‐ager the city still had a commissioner, Stanley Fryczynski, who could barely speak English. But as an undertaker he probably knew more families in town than anybody except “the good fath ers.” Jews accounted for most of the rest of the population, and I grew up thinking that Protestants were a tiny minority group. In the fifth grade boy named Johnny Powers joined our class, which was replete with DeMar and and I remember thinking that he had a queer last name. I was completely unaware of the Anglo‐Saxon sound of my own name, which had been changed from the Russian, Rogowsky. For some reason, Bayonne seems particularly prone to scandal and disaster. While I was in high school, we made front pages across the country when a train fell off a draw bridge someone had casually neg lected to close, killing several dozen passengers. A few years later, an imaginative entrepreneur helped bankrupt a Wall Street invest ment house by swinging a big deal in which a huge supply of salad oil was to serve as collateral. The tanks which supposedly contained the stuff were in Bayonne. They, were empty. Next to oil refining, Bayonne's big gest industry is probably crime. It took me years to realize that those men talking furtively into telephones in the backs of candy stores were taking heft. Some investigators have linked Bayonne's Congressman, Rep resentative Cornelius Gallagher, to the Mafia, in particular to a gentle man known as “Joe Bayonne” Zica relli, which could give “Joe Bayonne” an uncommon advantage in his line of work. For years our most famous natives were Sandra Dee, the actress known for her deathless portrayal of the title role in “Gidget Grows Up,” and Dick Brodowski, who once pitched for the Boston Red Sox against the New York Yankees — and lost. Now the town claims Arthur Burns, the head of the Federal Reserve Board, and Frank Langella, the young actor who plays a callous stud in “Diary of Mad Housewife.” “Bayonne people,” a friend once said, “always tell you where they're from because they're so proud of having risen above such humble beginnings.” WHEN I came back for the re union, I had not been to Bayonne for several years. My parents moved to Lakewood, in central New Jersey, after I graduated from college, and only my grandfather still lives there. As I walked through Newark Airport the passing faces kept looking fa miliar. Several times I had to stifle a greeting when the face turned out to be that of a stranger. After renting a car and checking into a motel near the airport, I tried unsuccessfully to take a nap. Feeling a little like a var sity member about to play a big basketball game, I changed my shirt and drove the few miles to Bayonne. The party was being held in the Hi‐Hat Club, a “hall for hire” with doorway edged in orange neon. It was not a Jewish place, so I doubt if I had ever been there before (in Bayonne, such ethnic distinctions are not taken lightly). I was greeted by Marie Sestito, a jolly girl draped in floor‐length pastel, who professed to remember me. On a side table were name tags and favors — small glass bowls with six gold plastic tooth picks. “They're nice for olives,” said one girl. Slowly the crowd gathered. Ten years ago last June we grad uated from Bayonne High School, old B.H.S., with the school song ringing in our well‐scrubbed and clearly vis ible ears. (“Oh, Bayonne, we'll strive for thy glory/ To our alma mater    (Continued from Page 46) we'll be true.”) High school had been a torturous time in many ways. With acne on my face, braces on my teeth and a skinny body one local sports writer insisted on calling “elongated,” I had an infe riority complex that was prob ably justified. I was the sort of social incompetent who learned every new dance after the cool kids had moved on to something else. Yet it was also a marvelously uncompli cated four years. Grass was what the sign said not to walk on in the county park. Sex was something that hap pened to somebody else. Some of the bolder guys carried condoms around “just in case,” but they usually crum bled from age and disuse. Most of us were blissfully ignorant of politics, at least until the spring of our senior year. Then we rooted for Hu bert Humphrey, the great lib eral hero, against John F. Ken nedy, the political wheeler dealer, in the West Virginia primary. Blacks — still called “colored” in Bayonne — were virtually invisible except for an occasional athlete or class clown. The heaviest reading undertaken by many of my friends was the gossip column in Bayonne Facts. The apex of culture was a Frankie Avalon concert in the school gym followed by pizza at Dido's, a dimly lit joint where they served the watered Cokes so fast you finished one before the pizza came and had to order another. Pizza was a staple in our diet, despite its pimple ‐ producing properties, and I spent my youth with a mouth perpetually seared by bubbling tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese. We heard vaguely of “beatniks” and “foreign movies,” and maybe we braved Greenwich Village once or twice for a cup of cappuccino, but for all we knew Jack Kerouac could have been a third baseman for the Dodgers. I once went to a Shakespeare play at the old Phoenix Theater in New York and fell Bayonne was a working class town. Only about a quar ter of the kids went to college, and most of those attended state or trade schools. Many who went right to work either could not afford college or got no encouragement from home to further their education. The school was seldom more help ful. To this day, they shuttle some of the brightest girls into commercial programs, which often condemn them to a life sentence in front of typewriter. I learned later that a number of these kids had eventually gone to col lege, sometimes at night, often at considerable sacrifice. A few are still going. There are, of course, some people in Bayonne who care deeply about culture and edu cation. I was fortunate enough to have two of them for parents. Both my mother and father had gone to college— although a combination of inertia and family ties kept them in Bayonne—and noth ing was quite so important to them as their children's edu cation. I also had one or two teachers who viewed the learning process as something more than the regurgitation of freeze‐dried facts. But neither my brother nor I would have applied to Har vard if the older brother of a girl I once dated had not urged us to make the stab. His name was Barney Frank, and he was a senior at Har‐. yard at the time. When we went to Cambridge for our interviews we stayed with him, and I was deeply disap pointed that the chatter centered more on female pul chritude than politics. When I inquired about the absence of a genuine intellectual col legiate bull session—or what I thought of as a bull session —Barney pointed to his two roommates. “We've been roommates for three years,” he laughed, “and whatever there is to be said about politics has been said.” We were interviewed the next day by an admissions officer who had spent the war at the Bayonne Naval Supply Depot, and—maybe out of sympathy ACCORDING to question naires they filled out for the reunion, many of my class mates have been married 6 or 8 years, a few as long as 10. Yet only a few have more than two children, an indica tion that many Catholics are not listening to the Pope on birth control. Most of them have decent, average jobs: salesman, dentist, insurance agent, accountant, hair dress er, office clerk, mortician, computer programer, airplane pilot, fireman, toll collector on the New Jersey Turnpike. The strangest job was running 10‐day sailing cruises in the West Indies. The most suc cessful and the least success ful apparently did not come back; my brother, a professor of economics at Harvard, was absent, and so were the guys who pump gas. Many of the reunioners had moved to the suburbs, quenching the land hunger inherited from their immigrant forebears. Under “places traveled” in the ques tionnaire, a few listed Europe, and a sizable number men tioned Florida and the Carib bean. Many had gone no fur ther than Washington, D.C., or the Jersey Shore. Only two said they had been in Vietnam. Many of my classmates who joined the Army young missed the war, and most of us who had college deferments man aged to escape altogether. One mother of three answered the question about travel with, AS we downed our first drinks, I looked around. A few had lost some hair, others (including me) had gained weight. The Lord giveth, I sup pose, and the Lord taketh away. Most of my old basket ball‐playing buddies reported that various physical calami ties had relegated them to golf or motorcycling. It struck me that if my wife had been there —our month‐old daughter kept her home — she would have been one of the few girls with long, straight hair, a style which is practically universal in California. Most of the girls wore it short or piled high on their heads in stiff, elaborate twists that looked a bit like Italian pastries. Later, dancing close to one of those lacquered confections, I felt a rush of memory; one whiff of hair spray and I wanted to go neck in the front parlor. The female fashion show included a few pants suits or hostess pajamas or openwork knit dresses, but the favorite was the tra ditional spangled sheath in pastel silk. Some of the guys were sporting modest mus taches or sideburns or collar length hair, but there was only one true freak, the husband of a class scatterbrain, who turned out to be, of all things, a newspaperman. In general, the gathering could have passed for the annual banquet of the Junior Chamber of Commerce. The background sounds ranged from casual chatter (“I don't know what it's like not to be pregnant.... We saw them last week in church”) to shrieks of recognition (“I don't believe it. I don't believe it!”). I started talking with Walter Gonsiewski, one of those amiable jokesters every one always liked, whose neck was gleaming from a fresh haircut. What was he doing? “Working, right? What else?” he laughed. “I'm a mechanic at Humble Oil; I fix the trucks.” Did he like it? “I care for it, it's for me, that's my kind of work. I never was much of a book man. I like tinkering with things—I'm wrench pusher.” We traded notes. Each of us had been married four years, each had a boy and a girl. “They're hot stuff, aren't they?” Walter asked enthu siastically. “It's the best time of a man's life, when his kids are this age. He can really enjoy them. I wouldn't trade it for the world. Thank God everything is as good as it is.” When Walter thanked God, felt he meant it. At that mo ment his wife, the former Marion Sudamack, came up. Ethnic ties are strong and open in Bayonne, and with a look of affection she said, “I married this Polack here.” Was she still a nurse? “I wouldn't let her go back to work,” said Walter. “You won't get me to babysit, not this guy.” What did he do in his spare time? “Work around the house, like everybody else.” The conversation with Wal ter set the tone for the eve ning. What really concerned my classmates were private things — family, job, home. had to shift gears a bit. As a reporter I spend most of my time talking to the exotic or the active. I sometimes get the feeling that most of the world is either grooving on brown rice or working for peace candidates. Yet some things don't change; in the middle of writing this I had to replace my son's diapers and read him a bedtime story. Because I went away to Harvard and have the kind of job I do, many of my friends are strivers, achievers. They want to have an influence, preferably on a national scale. What's more, they feel they deserve regular doses of pas sion, of intense experience, whether through drugs or art, sex or skiing. They want—or at least talk about—life with a capital L. Not my high‐school classmates. They are neither ecstatic nor depressed, and they do not expect to be. They are neither movers nor shakers, and that is all right. They are content. They get along. Slomovitz. Always pudgy, he is now a hefty young dentist practicing in Staten Island. “This guy needed someone in  his practice when I was look ing,” explained Jay, whose pretty wife was pregnant with their second child. “I'm more or less my own boss. I have a lot of freedom. I don't mind going there, it beats punching a time clock.” Politics? “I go along my own way. I feel rm a good listener. I'm not against the war and rm not for it. I spent two years in the service, and I found out a lot that other people don't know.” How did he feel? “Things could be better, they could be worse. I never think about it. I work hard and come home and unwind. don't do much of anything. My day is over at 6 o'clock, and I come home and relax.” But beneath the content ment, other currents are run ning. Mike Lipman was one of the social leaders of our crowd, the epitome of cool ness. Now he is married to a classmate, Brenda Appelbaum, and teaches physics at Bay onne High. He finds it diffi cult. “The kids are changing and the schools aren't,” he said. “We have the same administrators, but the kids know more; they're better in formed. They're not satisfied with commands, they want reasons, but too many teach ers say, `Do it my way.’ The administrators just can't ad minister. Their solution to a problem is to turn around and hide from it and hope it will disappear.” Was he happy? “Sometimes I am, but some times I wonder if rm doing any good to anybody, includ ing myself.” We talked some more and Mike mused: “I think we just missed out. The last five years have really been the turning point.” I heard that comment sev eral times during the evening. We had “just missed out” on most of the great changes of the sixties: We were out of college by the time the Viet nam war escalated, the civil rights movement turned bit ter, dorms went coed, pot became more popular than beer, college health services gave out birth‐control pills and assassination and con frontation became a reg ular part of our political life. By and large, we did what was expected of us. “Do your own thing” was still an un born cliché. MIKE'S frustrations were shared even more intensely by the girls. I joined a conversa tion between two fellow mem bers of Home Room 322, Joyce Frank Fishberg and Judy Kies nowski Czarneski. (If these two are classic examples of ethnic solidarity, many others are not. Arlyne Greenhill was married to Frank Fricchione, Jean Reilly to John Seman chick and Mary “Gigi” Barresi to Peter Jaroszewski.) Joyce now lives in the suburbs with her husband, who works for chemical company. “I felt like a duck out of water when moved to the sticks,” she said, “there's a rooster down the street, for God's sake.” AFTER several years as secretary in New York, she is now the full‐time mother of little girl, and she is not overjoyed. “I have to get back to work,” said Joyce, who al ways had a sharp‐edged pret tiness and fit well into a tight black dress. “But I'd really feel guilty if I left my daugh ter at this age. She needs me.  I like women's lib, but I've been brainwashed by the old school—I'd still feel guilty if I left my child. Work is much more rewarding than cooking or changing diapers or hear ing ‘Mommy, Mommy, Mom my, every minute of the day. I can't take it. There's got to be more to life than this. wasn't meant to be a servant, I don't think.” Judy taught high school for a while, but quit when the first of her three kids was born. What makes her happy? “When my kids are quiet, that's when I'm happy.” Pat Blihar also belongs to the old school. She met her husband—Sgt. Brian Connors of the Bayonne Police Depart ment — in a candy store his sister owned on Pat's corner. Her mother lives across the street and is an “excellent baby sitter” for the three little Connorses, aged 4%, 21A and 15 months. She worries about Brian. “I don't like my hus band being called a pig,” said Pat, who wore a lime‐colored silk suit. “I think he's a fair cop because I know he's a fair person. It's the over‐all dis respect for authority that bothers me. I don't want some nut taking a potshot at my husband because he hates cops. My husband is there to do a job, and he does it.” But Mrs. Connors worries even more about her children, two girls and boy: “I hope I'll be able to meet their needs as they get older. Each day is another problem, and I only hope I can handle it in the right way, especially with val ues changing so rapidly. I'm kind of old‐fashioned — not puritanical but old‐fashioned —even compared to a 21‐year old. Sometimes being a mother is a very awesome thing.” How was she old‐fashioned? “I still think the father should be head of the family and the mother should be home caring for the kids. Not that she shouldn't go out and have a part‐time job, but it shouldn't interfere with her home life. I also think religion should be instilled in children. People place less and less importance on this, but kids need some thing to be guided by, they need to know there's a Higher Being. Fewer and fewer fami lies attend mass; it seems like it's breaking down.” AS we sat down to dinner, it was obvious that the cliques of 10 years before had been well preserved. The wealthier Jews, those who had lived in the same neighbor hood and had gone to the same totally white elementary school, mostly sat together. So did a group of bright, non Jewish girls, many of whom had gone to local colleges. ‘Some of the cheerleaders, the “personality kids,” were to gether. So were some of the athletes. I was asked to sit at the Jewish table (I had gone to that elementary school) by several girls who, in high school,.would not have asked me for the time. On my left was Arlyne Greenhill Fric chione, and I was stunned to realize that I had met her in kindergarten, 23 years ago. The talk was of old friends. (“I used to talk to Marley, but she cut it off. So she's not married. You'd think she had the bubonic plague.”) Of old times. (“Remember the party we had in your basement and Phyllis came running in and said she was pregnant, but it was really her mother?”) And of the years apart. (“I was teaching in Elizabeth and taught a boy they called the Hatchet Murderer. They said he killed some people, but he's all right in my book.”) Arlyne is a sensitive girl, now the wife of a musician after an unhappy first mar riage. Looking smashing in an (Continued from Page 120) aqua pants suit, she talked about teaching biology in a suburban high school: “The kids are so lost, the world is so ugly to them. When I was in high school I had nothing on my mind except whether was going to the [Jewish Community] Center tonight and what I would wear. These kids are so involved in life, they're so much more serious. I feel sorry for them. They're not kids anymore, they're adults.” Vicki Shandler Bern feld, the wife of a New York lawyer now living on Long Island, overheard. “I keep getting so frightened,” she said. “What am I going to tell my son?” Vicki, like so many wives, faces the classic dilemma. She wants to work — she once taught art — but she also wants to raise her children. This year she decided to take art lessons, and one night a week her husband comes home early to take care of the two kids. It is an imperfect solution, but working is no panacea, either. David Bern feld is as unsettled as his wife. “I react to day‐to‐day things,” he said. “Nixon and Agnew get me bugged, but not enough for me to get actively in volved. I do some volunteer legal work, but like all of us, I'm still finding myself.” The problem, of course, is where to look. Gigi and Peter Jaroszewski came over. Peter and I had played softball together in the fourth grade. In high school I had admired Gigi from afar, but I had been too afraid of the religious prob lem to ask her out. (Like many things, religious differences seemed so big then, so small now. Six years after gradua tion I married a Catholic.) With Gigi's support, Peter earned a degree in civil engi neering, and now he works for a company trying to abate water pollution. “We try to treat this stuff and those big companies just keep dropping it in,” he said. “I think they'd rather spend the money on fines than on stopping pollu tion.” The Jaroszewskis have no children, but they're still concerned about young people. “Kids today are stupid,” said Peter, “they don't enjoy high school the way we did. All they want to do is cause trouble. But maybe we just don't understand them.” Gigi made a face. “How can they neck with someone who has long hair?” she asked. Public issues intruded into only a few conversations. When they did, it was usually because of personal experi ence. Living in northern New Jersey, for instance, makes one keenly aware of the pollu tion problem. Several people talked wearily about ending the war, but at least one fel low said: “If we don't fight them there, we'll fight them here.” The smoldering resentment against longhairs flared up when one girl started attack ing the freaky newspaperman and his wife, who was wear ing a gypsy‐style gown. “She was mad at me because I didn't have children,” the newspaperman's wife ex plained the next night. “She assumed I was selfish and didn't want them, just be cause of the way I looked.” She said she had had several miscarriages. The reunion conversation also included a tirade against welfare. “It was like a Grade B flick,” said my friend Helene Holder at the post mortem. “They were still us ing the old stereotyped argu ments, and I found myself giving stereotyped replies.” One guy a was Ray Poplaski, known as “Moose” when we played in the Biddy Basketball League because of his slight build. Ray works for an investment house on Wall Street, and takes a few courses at night. “I'm not complaining,” he said, “I didn't go to college and I can't expect the breaks but I'm not afraid to go out and hustle.” Recently his wife was attacked on the subway. “I think the coloreds are get ting too much handed to them,” he said. “They don't want to work. Fifteen‐ or 16 year‐old kids roughed up my wife and ripped her dress. It really shakes the hell out of you. There were four white guys standing there, and not one of them told the kids to knock it off. This is it. No one wants to do anything about it. Give, give, give. If me or you roughed somebody up, we'd sure as hell get arrested.” THE the Blue Chips, wore pink shirts and clip‐on bow ties and featured a lot of accordion music. When they played a lively polka, dozens of couples jammed the floor. The Bunny Hop was a big hit, as was the Charleston. Occa sionally they dredged up a song from our youth—“Blue Suede Shoes,” for example— and a few couples with good memories went out and jitter bugged. As I watched the jit terbuggers I realized how un sexy the dance was. It had been a big thrill for us to do a “slow” dance and feel the jab of two small, pointed breasts as we maneuvered closer, palms sweating. For years now, of course, the more expressive high‐school dancers have been in danger of arrest for simulating sexual inter course in a public place. Yet they dance alone now, without touching. We always touched hands, we were always to gether. (What did Arlyne call her students? Lost?) The band played the Bayonne High School fight song (“Bayonne goes marching down the line/ Everyone is feeling mighty fine”) and closed. Most of the people were already gone, and the evening ended on a sort of down note. “I feel like it's a dream,” Arlyne had said earlier, and Vicki had replied: “Everybody has their own life, that's what it is.” THE next day I drove around Bayonne. Everywhere were the signs of family things, private things: a man painting his porch railing, young couple polishing their car, a grandfather walking his tiny charge, a group in hats and white shirts off to visit relatives, cake box clutched in hand, a boy nuzzling a girl in the doorway of a shuttered store, a parade of cars parked in front of a church, decorated with pink streamers, waiting for the wedding party. The churches are the grandest buildings In town, great stone structures now as grimy as the factories where so many of their parishioners work. They serve not only as places of worship but as community centers. At Assumption, the main Italian church, a giant bowling pin affixed to the school dwarfs all else. At St. Henry's, the Irish citadel, a sign advertises “Bingo Every Saturday Night.” Bayonne is that rarest of entities, a genuine community. My grandfathers, both refu gees from Russia, came to the town about 50 years ago, when it was still mainly dairy farms. My mother was born there. She lived in a house her father had built with his own hands—a house I lived in, too, until I was 13. I drove by. It is still there, very much the same except for a coat of bright green paint and the latest local rage, an address written .out in script. I thought of some longhairs I met re cently in Taos, N.M. The thing they wanted to do most in the world was live in a house they had built them A REMARKABLE web of relationships enmeshes you in a town like Bayonne. Just driving around I saw Iorio's Shoe Repair (I went to ele mentary school with Janice Iorio), Hourihan's Liquor Store (Mary Hourihan was my fresh man algebra teacher), Cher ow's Housewares (I took Re nee Cherow to the junior prom), Kavula's Bar and Grill (Tommy and Johnny Kavula were on my Little League team). A real ‐ estate firm whose signs sprinkled the city is run by the husband of my mother's girlhood chum. Around the corner from my old house, Mr. Levine, now well into his seventies, still tended his tiny fish and vege table store, wearing—I swear —the same gray sweater he did 20 years ago. A few blocks away 1 went to see my grand father, my father's father, who still owns a business in Bayonne. His long, varied and largely unsuccessful career in cluded running an amuse ment park, promoting boxing matches, building houses and selling lumber. “Most of the chicken coops in Toms River are built with my plywood,” he remembered. On the man tel was a framed photograph of his family, including a dark‐eyed sister named Re becca, my daughter's name. He was the only one who ever left Russia. One sister is stilt alive in Moscow, but he talked about going back to what he considered his true home. Is rael. He had lived there for several years as a youth. and worked on some of the first (Continued from Page 125) I want,” he said, “is plenty of fish, plenty of fruit, peace of mind and The New York Times.” I STAYED in town an extra day so I could visit the high school, and I looked up some of my old teachers to ask what had changed. For one thing, there was a new dress code; girls could now wear slacks, and when the classes changed it was obvious that most of them took advantage of the new rule. It was also obvious that their straight, flowing hair had seldom been tortured like their older sis ters'. The blacks now had an Ebony Culture Club, the rate of illegitimate babies was up, teachers were required to take a course in drug prevention.  complained that there still weren't enough kids willing to think for themselves, but one of the others was distressed. “The place is falling apart,” she told me. “I never ran up against this before. I tell them what I want and they resent it and talk back. ”  Later I went to see the principal, Alexander X. O'Con nor, known with something less than affection as “The Ax.” He kept using words like “dialogue” and “communica tion,” but what he really wanted to communicate about was sports. “Our participation in sports is excellent,” he said, his face lighting up. “We've won a couple of county cham pionships recently, and that really helps.” What about drugs? “For a while there was some glue‐sniffing and mari juana smoking,” he said. “We've found some empty glue bottles, but I think it's fairly well controlled.” When I kept the tion away from football, Mr. O'Connor got a bit uneasy. “These kids go to the theater and see these movies and hear all those four‐letter words,” he said. “I may be old‐fash ioned, but I still like to say, `yes, sir’ and `no, sir.’ There are certain niceties you shouldn't throw out the win dow.” What about student compliats that they did not have a large enough role in the school? “The day of exer cising dictatorial power is over,” he conceded, “but they have",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

to realize that I also get directives I don't like. I have a superior, too.” I had the feel ing that old B.H.S. was as it always had been; my sharpest memory was of the agony of waiting for the bell to ring. One of my old teachers had given me a copy of The Bay onne Free Press, the high school's first underground paper. It was an amateurish, barely legible job, but it dem onstrated clearly that a lot more had changed in 10 years than the dress code. One article told how to get an abortion in New York, another attacked the use of a park to build a new City Hall (the city has also sold several parks for housing developments, a novel way to balance the budget). An editorial entitled “Get Out!” declared: “We must continue to oppose this immoral war in every possible way.” One could almost hear the beer glasses being slammed in anger on the bar at the Ameri can Legion post. On the cul ture page, one critic wrote about hearing a rock concert while stoned. Another called “Getting Straight” a “fantastic film” and with great relish quoted a line of Elliott Gould's: “Last week all that kid wanted was to get laid. Now he wants to kill some body.” When I was editor of The Bayonne High Beacon— now temporarily suspended because of a bureaucratic foul up — I thought I was being really radical when I wrote editorials deploring the lack of school spirit or the rising I LOOKED up the editors of The Free Press, Richard Dulee and Debbie Warnock. We talked in Debbie's living room under the watchful eye of her weary mother, who made it clear that she did not approve of the abortion article. Why an underground paper? “We felt there was too much cen sorship by the advisers to The Beacon. We want to control what we put in our own paper,” said Richard, a sin cere, thoughtful youth. For instance, the advisers had slashed an article telling kids where to get draft counseling and had decreed that all ar ticles must apply to students. “There's no world outside, right?” Richard said wryly. Were drugs “fairly well con trolled,” as the principal had said?” “They're available all over the place,” answered Debbie, who will have to work next year to afford college. “Each year they're more and more in the open. Now you can hear kids yelling in the (Continued from Page 130) halls, ‘I've got to cop some stuff tonight'” The pressures, added Richard, were enor mous. “If you don't do drugs, you're not a chicken—you're just not hip, which is worse.” Did he do drugs? “I'm more of an individual than most kids; I can say no and still feel good about it.” F:ELING good. It so often comes down to that. Wander ing through the high school I ran into Joyce Lauton Nestle, literally the girl next door, now an English teacher. She was a year older, but we had played together as chil dren, and I asked her about her friends. “You know, when we were in high school, we used to do skits about how horrible suburbia was and sit around and laugh. Now we're all living that way.” She thought a bit and added: “We're scared whether we're going to make it. We believe in the new ideas, but we don't know whether we can live with them. Like the idea of property. I like the idea of a commune, but I'm used to the old way. I don't think we're flexible enough for the changes that are coming, and it hurts so much to be insecure.” Joyce touched on some thing I had seen reflected in many of my classmates. We had “just missed out” on many things—Vietnam, drugs, even the Beatles. More deeply, we had missed out on the changes in so many basic as sumptions. We had been shaped in the dying years of a world that no longer exists. We had been taught that you play by the rules, that you respect authority, that reason is the source of all wisdom, that caution is a virtue, that sex is dirty and that a woman's place is in the home. We could just as easily “let it all hang out” as fly to the moon. At 27," we are old fashioned. And that is not a very comfortable thing to be these days.• """,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CURB ON ABORTIONS OPPOSED BY CHASE,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/12/07/archives/curb-on-abortions-opposed-by-chase.html,"The city's Health Services Administrator, Gordon Chase, said yesterday that it was pre mature to consider restricting abortions here under the state's new abortion law that went into effect only four months ago.  About limiting abortions to city residents, Mr. Chase said such a requirement would be “not right,” in view of New York's traditional willingness to offer medical treatment to those who need it. He added that such a restriction was un necessary.” Mr. Chase said a proposed restriction against performing abortions on women more than 12 weeks pregnant would open the door to illegal abor tions. Although roughly a third of the 50,000 women who have had abortions in New York were beyond the 12‐week stage, Mr. Chase said the ex perience in Japan, which has had an abortion law for some time, indicated that the figure should drop eventually to 10 per cent. The Administrator made his remarks on WNBC‐TV's “News light” program. Also, yesterday, a small group of young women marched in front of St. Patrick's Cathedral to protest a pastoral letter denouncing abortion. The letter, written by Cardinal Cooke, was to be read in every Roman Catholic church in the state. The demonstration outside the cathedral was sponsored by the Women's Abortion Pro ject and the Women's Health and Abortion Project, both parts of the Women's Libera tion Center, at 36 West 22d Street.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Adoption Agencies Report Shortage of White Infants,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/12/07/archives/adoption-agencies-report-shortage-of-white-infants-sharp-drop.html,"Adoption agencies across the country report a recent sharp drop in the number of white infants being placed for adoption.  Many agencies report that couples wanting to adopt healthy white babies must wait 18 months or more be fore the agency even has one available. Other agencies have stopped taking applica tions altogether. Still others are bringing in babies from Canada and oth er countries, and many Would‐be parents are turning to independent, or “gray mar ket,” adoptions arranged quickly by private attorneys at high fees. Abortion Laws Cited Adoption officials concede that they cannot be positive of the reasons for the drop. But most cite, as probable causes, eased abortion laws, improved contraception and changing attitudes that allow an unwed mother to keep her child. Although no national statis tics are available, the New York‐based Child Welfare League of America notes that this year, and most noticea bly in the last three or four months, adoption agencies have been reporting fewer Caucasian infants available. Similarly, Mrs. Ursula M. Gallagher, an adoption spe cialist in the Department of Health, Education and Wel fare, said that while the num ber of adoptions in the United States had shown a gradual increase from 166,000 in 1958 to 171,200 last year, recent indications are that fewer normal white babies are cur rently available. At the same time, both public and private agencies report a continuing problem with placing older children, black children and children with handicaps—all catego ries in which there has long been an excess of supply over demand. New York Picture In New York, an area where the trend has been pronounced, Msgr. Howard Moore of the Catholic Home Bureau said he could not re member a time when fewer normal white babies were being put up for adoption. His agency, a sister agency of the New York Foundling Hos pital, is turning away appli cants for these babies. The decline, he said, has been “most discernible in the past three months.” “No one has analyzed the situation yet,” he said, “but its a trend that all adoption agencies are beginning to notice.” While most adoption of ficials interviewed mention easier abortion as a probable cause for the trend, the pat tern of declining availability of adoptable white babies seems relatively consistent across the country, regardless of the state law governing abortion. In Minneapolis, for instance, supervisors of private adoption agencies generally agreed that adoptable Caucasian infants were in shorter supply in recent months, although Minnesota law permits abortion only in cases in which the mother's life is In danger. Moreover, Lew Linde, su pervisor of child placement for the Minnesota Department of Public Welfare, estimated that whereas two years ago about 40 per cent of the unwed moth ers in that state chose to keep their children while 60 per cent elected to put them up for adoption, recently that situation had almost exactly reversed it self, with about 60 per cent's of unwed mothers keeping their children. At the same time, statistics indicate that it would be a mis take to discount easier abortion as a factor. 16 States Relax Laws It has been estimated that up to 200,000 legal abortions will be performed in the United States this year, compared to 15.000 two years ago. Sixteen states have recently relaxed re strictive abortion laws to some degree. And it is clear that some prospective mothers of un wanted children are willing to leave their home states to get an abortion. In New York, where the nation's most per missive abortion law was insti tuted July 1, officials estimate that out‐of‐state women ac counted for one‐third of the approximately 20,000 abortions performed in the first three months the law was in effect. In California, a liberalized abortion law appears to have had a great effect on the adop tion picture. The state predicts 60,000 legal abortions this year, compared to 15,000 last year, with only 26 per cent involving married women. And a sharp decline is reported in white ba bies available for adoption. Whatever the causes, the shortages of normal white in fants in the face of an increased demand for such babies has ac celerated what one adoption of ficlal called “the great baby hunt.” A New Jersey agency, for example, told a caller that be cause of the shortage of babies, it was bringing them in from Canada. This Is a complex proc ess involving immigration clear ance and other problems. None theless, the agency said, “some agencies are even importing them from Korea.” Officials report a slight in crease in white adoptions of Oriental, American Indian and, to a lesser extent, Negro chil dren. There has also been an ap parent increase in independent non‐agency adoptions arranged by lawyers with the mother and the prospective adoptive par ents. While the term “gray mar ket” has been applied to this procedure, it is legal in all but two states, Connecticut and Delaware, and many parents seeking a child turn to it as last resort. The process usually involves a high lawyer's fee, which some say is determined as much by the fact that the lawyer knows where to find an adoptable baby as by the legal steps in volved. The new parents usually pay medical and transportation costs. A Jewish couple in New York recently tried several agencies without success, with most de clining even to put them on waiting list. Dejected, they tried two law yers without success, paying each an initial fee of $100 to attempt to find a child of Jew ish parentage, preferably a girl. A Jewish girl is one of the most difficult adoption categories to fill.

However, the Bureau of Child Welfare in New York points out that the inde pendent adoption procedure, while entirely legal, does not in clude such safeguards as con cealing the identity of the adop tive parents from the natural mother, a situation that can have uncomfortable conse quences if the mother has sec ond thoughts and decides she wants her child back.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ottawa Panel Urges Women's Equality,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/12/08/archives/ottawa-panel-urges-womens-equality.html,"OTTAWA, Dec. 7—A Gov ernment commission on the status of women called today for radical reforms to make women the equal of men “in every area of Canadian soci ety.”  Among 167 recommendations to Parliament, the commission of five women and two men listed abortions on demand for women pregnant 12 weeks or less, sterilization on demand for birth‐control reasons, birth control information for all and a ban on marriages “under any circumstances” for those under 18 years old. The book‐length report, pub lished today after a three‐year study, argued that to achieve equality with men, the Canadi an woman must be given “spe cial treatment” to overcome the discrimination she suffers. For example, it said that “women should be free to choose whether to take employ ment outside of their homes.” But to do so would mean the establishment of a network of child care centers. The com mission, therefore, recommend ed new provisions in the Na tional Housing Act to finance these centers to supervise chil dren while mothers work. The care of children, the commission said, should be responsibility shared by the father and society as well as the mother. Commission Member Protests Dr. John Humphrey of McGill University, Montreal, one of the two men on the commission, disassociated himself from the report, which he said intro duced new kinds of social dis crimination into Canadian so ciety. He also called the report unfair because it portrayed some housewives as “social parasites.” Anne Francis, 62, an Ottawa lecturer and writer who served as the commission chairman, defended the report on grounds that it aimed at providing I greater social and legal equality for women. High on the commission's list of discrimination was what it called “sex‐typing of occupa tions,” meaning that many posi tions are not available to women. The Government was urged to promote more women to senior positions in the public service and on Government boards and commissions. Enlistment in the Royal Cana dian Mounted Police should be open to women, the commission said. Women also should be ad mitted to the military colleges of the Canadian armed forces. About 450 young men are ad Imitted yearly to Canada's three military colleges, but no women. Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau submitted the report to the House of Commons this afternoon without comment. The commission was set up in 1967 by Lester B. Pearson, then Prime Minister. Mr. Trudeau pushed through Parliament a bill liberalizing Canada's strict abortion law. But the new law permits a hospital to perform an abor tion only after a team of three doctors has certified that an abortion is required to pro tect a woman's health. It falls far short of “abortion on de mand.” The commission suggested that after the 12th week of pregnancy a woman be given an abortion if her doctor agreed she could or should have one. On birth control, the report recommended that all young girls be informed about contra ceptives and given access to them. “The ues of contraceptives cannot be isolated from the complete sexual life and the quality of relations with the other sex,” the report said. “What is needed,” the com mission said, “is a family life program on traditional and changing concepts of masculin ity and feminity and of rela tionships between boys and girls, men and women, hus bands and wives, parents and children.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WOMEN LAWYERS  CITE OBSTACLES,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/12/09/archives/women-lawyers-cite-obstacles-sex-discrimination-is-called-major.html,"NEW HAVEN, Dec. 8—When Mrs. Eleanor Jackson Piel, a former deputy attorney genera’ of California, finished her sum mation of a criminal case in Federal court recently, the judge warned the jury not to be mis led by her beauty and charm when delivering the verdict in the case.  “Only when the Women's Liberation Movement came,” said Mrs. Piel, “did I realize how many kinds of discrimina tion I, as a woman lawyer, have had to sweep under the rug.” Her feelings were echoed by Catherine G. Roraback, a found er of the New Haven branch of the American Civil Liberties Uhion. A lawyer who has pre sented several challenges to Connecticut's law on birth con trol, she is currently defense attorney for Erika Huggins, Black Panther on trial here with Bobby G. Seale. “The single most exciting thing that has happened in the law recently is the current renaissance of feminism, which should eventually lessen the obstacles which a woman law yer now faces,” Miss Roraback said. Enrollment Increase Noted The views expressed recently by Mrs. Piel and Miss Roraback at a panel on “Women and the Law” held at Yale University reflected a new trend in the nation's law schools. While, according to reports from the Association of American Law Schools, there has been a dra matic increase in women law students this year, there also seems to be a heightened awareness of the obstacles women lawyers can expect to encounter in society. Despite the fact that 100 years have passed since the first woman trial lawyer pre sented a case in a United States court, Mrs. Piel observed that the woman trial lawyer's first task is still “to prove her right to be in the courtroom.” Kathryn Emmett, who is be ginning her career as a trial lawyer with a Bridgeport, Conn., firm, noted that upon entering a courtroom she's often asked whether she is the defendant or a secretary. When she went to visit her client at a small jail in Mont ville, Conn., recently, officials made her wait 2½ hours while they verified her credentials with a telephone call to her office that began, “There's woman here who claims she's an attorney.” Other obstacles women law yers encounter, according to Mrs. Piel, include “going into jails and not being allowed to see clients, being singled out as the brunt of the judge's dis affections and being publicly insulted.” Not a School Issue Women law students at Yale tend to minimize the issue of sex discrimination within the school itself. “Most of the pres sure comes from the awareness of what you will face when you get out,” said Mary Nichols, third‐year law student. “It's not easy for women to succeed in the law because they feel themselves restricted,” said Mrs. Ellen Peters, the only woman on the faculty of the Yale Law School. “It's less dif ficult going to school than finding jobs after you've been trained.” According to a spokesman for the Association of Ameri can Law Schools, approximately one‐half of the 150 law schools in the country have no women on their faculty. Of the re maining law schools, the ma jority have one woman faculty member and a handful have more than one. New Courses Given Yale and several other law schools have established new courses in women and the law. “People think that women's rights law is a narrow field limited to abortion and mar riage cases, but women have a separate legal status that is reflected in all legal disciplines —employment law, education law, criminal law, media law, family law, constitutional law, tax law, etc,” said Anne Freed man, a third‐year law student at Yale who is one of the stu dent organizers of the course on women and the law. Specific issues covered in the course include sex dis crimination in high schools, college admissions and curricu lums, women's rights to control their own bodies, women's rela tion to Government programs such as welfare and public housing and the processes in volved in challenging the li censes of radio stations. Activist Group Approximately one‐third to one‐half of the 60 women stu dents at the Yale Law School are involved in some kind of women's rights activities. Some have become involved in women students action group, which lobbies and makes pro posals to the law school in the areas of admissions, recruiting and employment discrimination. Several students are involved In a suit before a three‐judge Federal court asking that Con necticut antiabortion laws be declared unconstitutional. The women hope to involve 300 to 400 plaintiffs in the case and institute other educational ac tion around it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Student Volunteer Corps Urged in Ohio by Gilligan,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/12/09/archives/student-volunteer-corps-urged-in-ohio-by-gilligan.html,"KENT, Ohio, Dec. 8—On the other side of the hill where four students were killed by the, National Guard last May, the Governor‐elect of Ohio met the students of Kent State Univer sity today.  A month before he takes of fice, John J. Gilligan, a Demo crat, proposed a statewide Vol unteer Corps in a speech after meeting townspeople and col lege people this afternoon. The lanky, red‐haired former college professor urged the state to utilize its 700,000 col lege‐age people in the Volun teer Corps and he named a 26 year‐old lawyer from Cinciti nati, Gerald Springer, to head the program. Many of the spe cifics are still to be worked out, but Mr. Gilligan said he hoped taxes would be raised. Mr. Gilligan's visit to Kent began quietly at the modest City Hall, where 50 selected townspeople questioned him about taxes, voting laws and drugs. But the people never mentioned the events of list May, when the Reserve Officers Training Corps building was burned and the National Guard opened fire on the students. Students Inactive Perhaps the people have for gotten the matter, partly be cause the students have not been active this fall or perhaps the people are content that justice has been served. What ever the reason, the subject never came up until Mr. Gil ligan reached campus. Fifty representatives of the various student groups had as sembled in the lounge of the Wooden Honors Building, across the sidewalk from the muddy patch where the R.O.T.C. build ing once stood. Mr. Gilligan began by Warn ing against “all kinds of vio lence, including verbal,” and he talked about making a new beginning. Then, the students began asking questions. One student asked if Mr. Gilligan approved of Ohio House Rule 1219, which liMits mass protest gatherings. “I consider it to be a badly worded, bad example of legis lation,” Mr. Gilligan answered. A student wearing a woolen knit cap asked if Mr. Gilligan was satisfied with the Portage County Grand Jury, which in dicted 25 students and faculty without indicting any members of the Guard. “We still don't know what evidence was presented,” Mr. Gilligan said. “Personally, don't ‘believe the action of the National Guard was justified and I'm going to make sure get a copy of the report by the F.B.I. Then we'll see.” Mr. Gilligan refused to say whether he would Initiate any further grand jury investiga tions but he did promise to re place Sylvester DelCorso as Adjutant General. “We would like a man who shows he understands, at least embryonically, the need for adequate precaution,” Mr. Gil ligan said. “I don't believe in sending half‐trained men in a tumultuous atmosphere with loaded guns.” In replies to other questions, Mr. Gilligan said he favored student representation on the board of ‘trustees, was against R.O.T.C. as an academic sub ject, and favored housing pro grams at the local level. The father of four also said he would not personally favor any abortion or birth control aid by the state. Even after an hour of steady questions and answers, many of the students did not seem to feel that Mr. Gilligan had given them any new answers. A few of his campaign work ers said they felt “frustrated.” A Proposal Promised But Mr. Gilligan reminded them that he was saving a pro posal for the speech he would deliver later and the discussion broke up. After an inforimal dinner with faculty members, he spoke at the University Au ditorium about his new pro grams. “If each person in Ohio would give one eight‐hour day a year to his community, we would have five and a half mil lion man hours 9f work in the public interest,” he said. our young people care for he neglected in our mental hospitals or the needy children in our day‐care cen ters? Could they help local law enforcement agencies? Could they reclaim ruined streams and replant land rav aged by strip mines? They could, indeed, and I think they will.” Mr. Springer, who was named to head the’ Volunteer Corps, recently ran a strong losing race in Ohio's Second Congres sional District. He was born in London, where his parents settled after fleeing Nazi Ger many.

L.I. Town Bars Abortion Clinic; Other Suburbs Consider Curbs,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/12/13/archives/li-town-bars-abortion-clinic-other-suburbs-consider-curbs.html,"HLTNTINGTON„ L. I., Dec. 12 The Town Board of this north shore community of about 20, 000 persons voted unanimously this week to bar abortions in any place other than a licensed and duly accredited hospital:  The vote was taken Tuesday night at the Huntington High School at a noisy public hear ing attended by about 600 peo ple, the overwhelming majority of whom were in favor of the legislation. The board's action is similar to those taken in New York City and in Niagara Falls. It is, however, the first such subur ban restriction on the five month‐old state law that per mits abortions to be performed during the first 24 weeks of pregnancy. The town of Babylon on the South Shore has scheduled public meeting Jan. 5 on the abortion law and the Suffolk County Legislature set a date of Dec. 22 for consideration of a resolution supporting the County Board of Health in its efforts to develop guidelines on abortions in the county. The Suffolk County Board of Health will meet Dec. 30 to discuss the abortion problem. It declared this week that “re cent proposals by certain groups to establish ‘clincs’ in Suffolk County to perform abortions outside of hospitals have aroused considerable con cern among physicians and resi dents?! The Huntington Town Super visor, Jerome A. Ambro Jr., in itiated the local law after the Medi‐Complex Ltd. of Smith town, a subsidiary of Compre hensive Educational Systems, Inc., of Brooklyn, had an nounced plans last month to establish an abortion clinic, the first in Suffolk County, within the town.

The company had earlier declared its intention to open about six such clinics in the metropolitan region, Petitions Support Law The Town Board was pre sented with petitions support ing the proposed law signed allegedly by about 14,000 resi dents of the largely upper middle class town. The major concern expressed by most of the speakers was that Hunting ‘ton should “not become an ‘abortion mill or capital.” The discussion frequently fo cussed on moral issues rather than the’ question of affiliation with accredited hospitals em phasized by the law. A spokesman for the Hunt ington Hospital declared that he was “unaware of any pa tient living in the area having been turned away for any rea son, including lack . of funds.” A spokesman for Medi‐Com plex had previously maintained that there was “a definite need for more medical facilities and such a service [abortion] in a quiet professional manner.” The center was suppored to have been designed to have a ‘blood bank, access to labora tory facilities and some facili ties for overnight patients and to have several gynecologists and obstetricians associated with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Feminist Marchers Brave Icy Rain,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/12/13/archives/feminist-marchers-brave-icy-rain.html,"Braving wind, cold and icy rain, 300 women marched up Fifth Avenue from 59th Street and across 86th Street to Gracie Mansion to demand free abortions and child‐care centers. The number of marchers fell far short of the thousands that the Women's Strike Coalition had predicted would take part. Most were bundled in heavy coats and many carried umbrellas on the two mile walk to Gracie Mansion. The women had been de nied a parade permit, but the police nevertheless allowed them to march up Fifth Ave nue three and four abreast provided they kept to a lane on the Central Park side of the roadway. Southbound ve hicular traffic was permitted to proceed on the east side of the avenue.

Among the groups that supported the march were Church Women United, Radi cal Nuns, the Young Women's Christian Association and Radical Lesbians. About 30 men marched with the women.

What We Have Forgotten About Pot,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/12/13/archives/what-we-have-forgotten-about-pot-a-pharmacologists-history-what.html,"THERE was a time in the United States when extracts of can nabis were as commonly used for medicinal purposes as aspirin to day. Not only was cannabis a medi cation that could be purchased with out a prescription in any drug store (which is almost unbelievable when you consider that mere possession of marijuana is now a serious of fense), but it was also prescribed by physicians as an important treatment for a large number of medical condi tions, from migraines and excessive menstrual bleeding to ulcers, epilepsy and even tooth decay.  If cannabis was so widely and apparently successfully used, why is this hardly known today? Were there legitimate medical reasons for the fall‐off in its employment by physicians, or did legal restrictions largely account for the dramatic changes in its availability? The an swer is probably a combination of the two. Cannabis, the generic name for marijuana, hashish and related pro ducts, has been in use legally or il legally for about 3,000 years. The story of its varying role in different cultures — both as a medicine and as a mind‐altering substance — and its spread from country to country is a fascinating one, and provides, moreover, important perspective on the controversy over whether mari juana is a threat to the well‐being of the young, on why the drug seems to divide the generations and on what, if anything, ought to be done about it. Before beginning this chronicle of cannabis as a medicine (I) and as an intoxicant (II), we should clarify the sometimes confusing jar gon applied to the plant and its deriv atives. The source of this medicine, or “dope,” depending on one's point of view, is the plant Cannabis sativa. There are male and female forms, although, as may seem fitting for SOLOMON H. SNYDER, M.D., is professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. This article is adapted from a book he writing about marijuana. the mascot plant of the unisex gen eration, it has recently been culti vated in a hermaphroditic variety. The psychoactive ingredients have, for about a thousand years, been as sumed to derive almost exclusively from the female plant. But in the past year, chemical analyses of the pure psychotropic (intoxicating) substances of cannabis showed that they are present in equal concentra‐ tion in male and female plants, an embarrassing revelation for hemp growers who have for years been discarding the male plants. The cannabis plant is also known as hemp, and its stalks have been a major source of fiber for cloth, beginning with the Chinese at least as long as 3,000 years ago. It grows freely as a weed in almost any cli mate, although the strains of plants grown in warmer climates produce more of the resin that contains the psychoactive material. The exact identity of this chemical was estab lished in 1964 by Dr. Raphael Me choulam in Israel, who showed it to be delta‐l‐tetrahydrocannabinol, and was even able to synthesize it from simple, basic chemicals. Commonly referred to as “T.H.C.,” the chemical in small doses produces a mild pot high, and in larger doses gives rise to hallucinogenic and psy chotomimetic (resembling psychosis) effects similar to an L.S.D. trip. De spite this similarity, however, T.H.C. has no chemical resemblance to any psychedelic drugs such as L.S.D., mescaline or psilocybin. Unlike opiate narcotics, moreover, cannabis is not physically addictive. Thus its consumers do not develop the compulsive craving that turns opiate addicts into thieves, prostitutes and pawns of organized crime. Also, no deaths have ever been reported from marijuana, in contrast to heroin, which sometimes kills because a fatal dose is not much greater than the amount needed to get high. Why are some preparations of cannabis terrifyingly powerful and others pleasantly mild? This seems to depend on which part of the plant is used. The flowering leaves of ripe male or female hemp plants secrete a sticky resin which is the source of all, or almost all, of the T.H.C. in cannabis. Marijuana, a Mexican term first applied to cheap tobacco and only in the late 19th century to cannabis, refers to preparations of leaves and stems of uncultivated ••••••• ????????????????? “Cannabis saliva.” wrote a 19th‐century doctor. “is valuable for pain, tends to relieve paralysis, and is used for coughs.” plants chopped up into something resembling crude tobacco leaf—rwith some seeds included. The T.H.C. con tent of marijuana is fairly low, and its effects are thus comparatively moderate. In the United States it is usually smoked or baked into cookies. In India the same preparation is called bhang and is legal. It is blended con ventionally into a pleasant‐tasting liquid concoction drunk at social gatherings and is also prescribed by physicians for a variety of medical purposes. The tops of cultivated plants are harvested in India and processed into a somewhat more po tent material called gaffe, which is usually smoked. The most potent cannabis prep aration is obtained by carefully scraping the resin containing T.H.C. from the leaves of the cultivated plants.. This gooey material is then pressed into hard blocks and, even tually, smoked. In India it is known as charas, and in other countries as hashish, which is about 10 times as powerful as marijuana and is the only cannabis derivative that can produce ‘hallucinogenic and psychoto mimetic effects with any regular . ity. Even experienced potheads are cautious in their use of hashish. I. THE “MIRACLE DRUG” THE first reference to the medical use of cannabis is in a phar macy book written about 2737 B.C. by the Chinese Emperor, Shen Hung, who recommended it for “female weakness, gout, rheumatism,, ma laria, beriberi, constipation and absent‐mindedness.” In China at that time, the hemp plant was also major source of fiber for the produc tion of rope, but there is little indica tion that its psychotropic properties were of much interest. Its pain‐kill ing powers were well‐known to the Chinese physician Hoa‐Gho, who mixed the resin with wine. This . preparation, which was called ma‐yo, was employed as an anesthetic in Some years later cannabis ex tracts were introduced in India, where they have, for more than thousand years, had medical applictions. An Indian girl who worked for me as a laboratory technician tells a story of her experience with the drug: She came from a wealthy family in Bombay, which, when she was a. little girl, sent her to the finest physician in the city be cause, apparently, the parents felt she. was too skinny to at tract a man. The doctor pre scribed a glass of: bhang be fore each meal, which greatly enhanced her appetite. By the time she was 17 she was vo luptuous and eminently‐nubile, though not, obese. Surprisingly, she cannot recall any psy chotropic effects, nor was she told by her physician to ex pect any The ancients in other coun tries seemed to know can nabis as a balm or, perhape; an antiseptic (though, of course, they knew nothing about bacteria then). In the papyrus of the pharaoh Ram ses, for example, washing sore eyes with extracts of the plant was recommended: In a folk remedy of the Mid dle Ages in Europe, the dried leaves were kneaded and ap plied with butter to burns. Ex tracts were also used as drops for earaches and for preventing inflammation of ulcers, and there are even claims that women stooping due to a, disease of the uterus were able to stand straight again after inhaling smoke. from the plant. Western physicians, how ever, remained largely igno rant of cannabis until 1839, when a 30‐year‐old British doctor serving in India, W. B. O'Shaughnessy, wrote a 49 page article in “The Transac tions of the Medical Society of Bengal” describing his ex periences with the drug. (The fact that we are able to pin point historically the intro duction • of cannabis into Eu ropean medicine is itself notable, since most drugs seem to be gradually adopted by doctors after originating in folk medicine.) O'Shaugh nessy reviewed the literature on the use of cannabis in In dian medicine‐during the pre ceding 900 years. A cautious man, he was not satisfied with the drug's well‐docu mented record of safety and proceeded, in a series of ani mal experiments, to test its effects as well as the limits of the dosage. He found can nabis remarkably safe in ani mals, a conclusion which has been reaffirmed times. In fact, despite many escala tions of the dose he could not kill any mice, rats or rabbits. Then, Dr. O'Shaughnessy ad ministered the drug to pa tients suffering from seizures, rheumatism, tetanus and’ rabies. His findings were that it relieved pain, was an anti convulsant and acted as a muscle relaxant. 0'SHAUGHNESSY'S work excited the interest of clini cians throughout Europe, and soon there were descriptions of its application to a range of ailments, including men strual cranips, asthma, child birth psychosis, quinsy, cough, insomnia, migraine headaches, chorea and with drawal from opiates. Some idea of this broad usage can be gleaned from 19th‐century medical journals. One investi gator wrote: “It acts as a soporific or hypnotic, causing sleep; as an anodyne in lull ing irritation; as an antispas modic in checking cough and cramp; as a nervine stimulant in removing languor and anx iety. Also, it raises the pulse and enlivens the spirits, with out any drawback or deduc tion of indirect or incidental convenience; and it concili ates tranquil repose without causing nausea, constipation or other signs of effect or in digestion, without headache or stupor.” Such testimonials from the medical profession ‐ were by no means rare, Hobart Hare's “Standard Textbook of Prac tical Therapeutics” stated: “Cannabis is very valuable for the relief of pain, partic ularly that depending on nerve .disturbances; it pro duces sleep; it gives great re lief . in paralysis and tends to quiet tremors; it is used in spasm of ithe bladder due to cystitis or nervousness; it is used in cough mixtures and does not constipate or de press the system as does mor phine.” Since extracts of hemp from colonial India Were the most abundant source of Can nabis ‐ in the 19th century, British physicians were re sponsible for the first explora tions of the medicinal uses of the drug. Of course, in those days, before the current era of super‐specialization in medi cine, individual doctors re searched and treated patients with a wide variety of ill nesses. Thus, men like Dr. J. Russell Reynolds, a physician to Queen Victoria, devoted 30 years to careful evaluation of cannabis under many condi tions. He was particularly im pressed with its ability to re lieve pain; his observation that the drug was especially effective when an emotional or psychosomatic element ag gravated an illness is of spe cial interest. Perhaps canna bis's tendency to release neurotic inhibitions and bring on euphoria, as well as its mild sedative action, was re sponsible for its unique abil ity to ease “nervous” pain. In much the same way today, a mild barbiturate together with aspirin and caffeine called Fiorinal — constitutes a most effective anti ‐ ten sion‐headache cocktail. Thus, Dr. Reynolds especially recom mended cannabis for migraine headaches. “Very many vic tims of the malady,” he re ported, “have for years kept their sufferings in abeyance by taking hemp at the mo ment of threatening or onset attack.” There are also indications that cannabis can help pre vent future attacks, or at least reduce the frequency and severity of the headaches. In modern medicine two dif ferent types of drugs are nor mally prescribed for these purposes: ergot derivatives such as ergotamine alleviate acute pain, and methysergide (Sansert) — which is, inter estingly, a close relative of L.S.D. and is hallucinogenic itself in bigger doses — is used to ward off future head aches. Dr. Hare, a professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, concluded that cannabis can fulfill both roles. ONE medical complaint that can benefit from a drug that relieves “nervous” pain is menstrual cramps, since relatively severe attacks are often emotionally caused. In deed, cannabis was prescribed extensively for the cramps in the 19th century, and physi cians soon discovered that it also relieved excessive men strual bleeding, or “menor rhagia.” Its successes here seem to have been spectacu lar. For instance, Dr. Robert Batho reported: “It [can nabis] is par excellence the remedy for that condition ... it is so certain in its power of controlling menorrhagia that it is a valuable aid to diagnosis in cases where it is uncertain whether an early abortion may or may not have occurred.” How cannabis slows down menstrual hem orrhage is something of Like narcotic pain‐relievers such as codeine, cannabis was also used frequently to control coughs. While today this may not seem to be so important, in the 19th cen tury tuberculosis was the leading killer of the young— and debilitated people of all ages with incessant, intracta ble coughing; any medicine that could ease the cough was thus a blessing. Cannabis was introduced in the West at a time when opiates were prescribed free ly and addiction was far more widespread than it is today. As a consequence, it was na tural that the drug should be tested as an aid in withdraw ing patients from opium, as well as from other addictive substances, such as alcohol and chloral hydrate. For ex ample, Dr. Edward Birch re ported in The Lancet: “I am satisfied of its immense value [in withdrawing patients from chloral hydrate or opium] ... the chief •point that struck me was the immediate action of the drug in appeasing the ap petite for the chloral or opium and restoring the ability to appreciate food.” The potential value of can nabis in helping to withdraw patients from alcohol or opium was rediscovered about 50 years later during an in vestigation of the marijuana problem in New York City sponsored by Mayor La Guar dia in the early nineteen forties. Doctors Samuel Al lentuck and K. Bowman found that by substituting cannabis for heroin, “the withdrawal symptoms were ameliorated or eliminated sooner, the pa tient was in a better frame of mind, his spirits were ele vated, his physical condition was more rapidly rehabili tated, and he expressed the wish to resume his occupa tion sooner.” Other investiga tors, however, have said re cently their experience is that cannabis is not effective as a means of easing off heroin. One is struck by the sug gestion of some researchers that, besides easing the craving for an addictive agent, cannabis had a tonic‐like ac tion, raising the spirits of the addict and increasing his energy and appetite. In O'Shaughnessy's first report on its uses in medicine, he cited its value in controlling convulsions. (Convulsions re sulting from many different causes in those days were lumped together, while today we can distinguish epilepsy from other causes.) There fol lowed reports of cannabis treatment of chorea, resulting from rheumatic fever, in which wild flailing of the arms—called St. Vitus's dance —resembled convulsions. However, its possible value in epilepsy remained buried for many years until routine screening of many substances in animals for anticonvulsant activity revealed an analogue of T.H.C., that is, a chemical similar to it in composition, which seemed to have anti convulsant properties. At this time, the late nineteen‐for ties, the attacks of most epileptics could be controlled by diphenylhydantoin (Dilan tin) or phenobarbital, which are still the major antiepilep tic drugs in medical practice today. To see whether T.H.C. could help epileptics, two re searchers — Doctors J. Davis and H. Ramsey—chose five in stitutionalized children whose attacks could not be con trolled with phenobarbital, Dilantin or even a combina tion of the two. Given T.H.C., two of the five became almost completely seizure‐free, and the other three did at least as well as they had on their previous drug regimen. The unavailability of cannabis or T.H.C. derivatives in the suc ceeding decade prevented any further medical investigation of this problem. The major use in the 19th century was as a pain‐killer or mild sedative‐tranquilizer and, since in those days opi um had been the most widely used drug for these purposes, most medical reports on can nabis concentrated on com paring the virtues and draw backs of these two drugs. One of the most obvious as sets of cannabis, apparently quite clear to 19th‐century physicians—but not yet clear to the United States Narcotics Bureau—was that prolonged use never led to addiction, nor did it result in tolerance to the drug's effects. This was commented on again and again in 19th‐century medical journals, was confirmed in the investigations of Mayor La Guardia's committee and has been confirmed repeatedly in studies over the last three years using both crude can nabis as well as pure T.H.C. In addition, cannabis prod ucts are far less toxic than the opiates. The latter drugs, including morphine and hero in, . kill by depressing the respiratory centers in the brain, and do so in amounts only a few times greater than therapeutic doses. By con trast, cannabis may well be one of the least toxic drugs known.  What about effects on the vegetative functions of the body? Opiates slow down the churnings of the intestines and routinely produce con stipation. Since opiate alka loids retard the secretions of the liver and the pancreas, they slow down digestion. Opiates retard the flow of bile by constricting the bile ducts, so that the pressure inside them builds up — sometimes causing severe colic pain; another unpleasant side effect is their tendency to cause nausea and vomit ing. Cannabis produes none of these effects. IN one important way opi ates are better than cannabis: they are stronger pain‐killers. For the excruciating colicky pain produced by a kidney stone or the crushing chest pain of an acute heart attack, morphine is a blessing. For these situations, cannabis is a weakling. _ Still, we have seen that the drug could be valuable in treating a number of condi tions. Why has it been so neglected in recent years? Legal restrictions are at fault to a large extent, • but they cannot be the sole reason. Well before the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937, in the late 19th and early 20th cen turies, cannabis as a general medicine was already on the decline. There had always been problems in prescribing the drug. For one thing, it is in soluble in water and so can not be injected intravenously for rapid effect. When taken by mouth, moreover, it does not begin to go into action for one to two hours—longer than for many other drugs. Even more troublesome was the difficulty during the 19th century of obtaining standard batches of cannabis. Different batches can vary tremendously in their po tency, probably because the amount of resin in plants de pends on ripeness, humidity, soil characteristics, tempera ture and time of year. In the early days of cannabis in Eu ropean medicine, the drug be came highly controversial on this account. On the one hand, highly reputed physi cians were praising it as a “miracle drug.” But at the same time others could not duplicate the therapeutic suc cesses of their colleagues and concluded, like Dr. J. Oliver, that cannabis “is hardly worthy of a place on our list of remedial agents.” It is possible that the “thera peutic failures” simply re flected weak preparations. This variability was well known even to O'Shaugh nessy, who observed consider able deterioration of the drug's potency while trans porting it from India to Eng land. Then, too, some of the therapeutic successes of can nabis could possibly have been “placebo” responses suggested by the physician. This is espe cially the case with headaches, menstrual cramps and emo tional ailments, which are par ticularly responsive to sug gestion. Dr.. Reynolds, an astute clinician, also pinpointed an other difficulty: the variabil ity of individual responses to the same dose of cannabis. “Individuals differ widely,” he said, `in their relations to many medicines and articles of diet, especially those of vegetable origin—such as tea, coffee, ipecac, digitalis . . and cannabis.” Anyone who has attended a pot party can vouch for this piece of wisdom. One more possible drawback might be that patients treated for medical conditions with cannabis might get high and become potheads. Yet, it is striking that so many of the early medical reports on cannabis fail to mention the plant's intoxicating prop erties. Rarely, if ever, is there any indication that pa tients — thousands must have consumed cannabis in Europe in the 19th century— were “stoned,” changed their attitudes about work, love, their fellow men or patriotism. It is unlikely that the plants grown 50 to 80 years ago differed in chemical composi tion from those growing to day. More likely, the differ ence is a matter of mental set or expectation on the part of the patient. When people see their doctor they want to be treated for a specific malady, and do not anticipate being “turned on” or “tuned in.” And recent investigations have suggested that the men tal effects of cannabis are quite dependent on the ex pectation of the subject. In the mid ‐ 19th century none of the drug's diffi culties seemed insuperable. Variations in individual re ponse and in the potency of different batches of the drug could be readily taken into account by starting patients with a small dose which might then be increased grad ually. The one‐ or two‐hour delay before the drug took effect could be tolerated, since most of the conditions to be treated were not life or‐death emergencies. For the same reason, it did not seem too much of a nuisance that cannabis could not be dis IT was probably the intro duction of a variety of new synthetic drugs that started the decline of cannabis. A major factor was the intro duction of the hypodermic syringe into American medi cine from England. This facil itated the injection of fast acting, water‐soluble opiate drugs, a practice which soon became widespread. The great number of casualties in the Civil War spread the use of intravenous morphine rapid ly. Although the danger of addiction had been well known since antiquity, some how physicians managed to forget about it when they were presented with the con venient tool of injectable morphine. Opiate addiction became so prevalent among soldiers who had received it for their wounds that it came to be called’ the “soldiers’ disease.” A few cautious physicians warned against what were soon to be the tragic results of this reckless prescribing of morphine. Mattison in 1891 reminded his colleagues of these difficulties and recom mended cannabis instead: “With a wish for speedy ef fect, it is so easy to use that modern mischief‐maker, hypodermic morphia, that they [young physicians] are prone to forget remote re sults of incautious opiate‐giv ing. Would that the wisdom which has come to their pro fessional fathers . . . might serve them to steer clear of narcotic shoals on which many a patient has gone awreck.” By contrast, he felt that his experience con firmed that “cannabis indica is a safe and successful ano dyne and hypnotic.” The new synthetic analge sics such as aspirin, as well as new sedatives such as barbiturates and chloral hy drate, also tended to replace cannabis. Just as with mor phine, the new drugs were more efficient to administer than cannabis, and made more money for the manufac turers, but they, too, had their drawbacks. Aspirin seems to be a less potent pain‐killer than cannabis, and lacks its relaxing, sedative action. Barbiturates, of course, can be addictive. What is worse, the lethal dose of barbiturates is so treacher ously close to the therapeu tic doses that these drugs are the most frequently employed chemical means for commit ting suicide. Those who use them fairly indiscriminately for nighttime sedation, even if they are not barbiturate ad dicts, often risk death from accidental overdoses or the effects of combining barbitur ates and liquor. Some of the objections to • REMEMBER THE NEEDIEST! cannabis extracts as medicine may soon be resolved by new research. Since the isolation and synthesis of T.H.C. in 1964, doctors have been able to reproduce most of the known effects of cannabis quite reliably. Thus it can be given in absolutely pure form and in regulated doses with predictable effects. What is even more inter esting is the possibility of developing variations. of this molecule which may selec tively retain certain of the actions of cannabis while dis carding others. This is not mere speculation. Quite re cently, Dr. Van Sim, a sci entist at the Edgewood Ar senal near Baltimore, tried “There is little evidence that patients given cannabis in the 19th century got ‘stoned’ or changed their views on love, work or patriotism.” out several variants of the T.H.C. molecule on man. One of these markedly reduced blood pressure at doses which produced few if any mental changes. Dr. Sim suggested that this drug might be valuable for hypertensive pa tients. Currently, several Ameri can drug companies are work ing feverishly to synthesize many new analogues of T.H.C. with the expressed aim developing medicines for treating a variety of maladiei. And all of this ac tivity goes on despite the official status of cannabis as a “dangerous drug.” It would be a good bet that the latter part of this century will witness the revival of cannabis in new forms as valuable therapeutic agent. II. THE “DELIGHT‐GIVER” ANCIENT Chinese writings refer • to cannabis _ as “the liberator of sin.” Probably there was a certain amount of controversy over the plant's merits then, just as there is today: other (pre sumably “pro‐pot”) Chinese writers refer to cannabis as the “delight‐giver.” As a mind‐altering sub stance, cannabis seems to have come of age in India, where it certainly was used as early as 1000 B.C. and soon thereafter became an in tegral part of Hindu culture. Why the drug should catch on in India but not in China is unclear. Perhaps this has something to do with the dif ference in temperament of the Indians and Chinese—or their respective religions. One might be tempted to suggest that the placid, practical Chi nese did not appreciate the euphoria produced by can nabis. Or maybe opium‐ was too well ensconced as their national vice. Hindus used cannabis as an aid in meditation. Its religious role is suggested by passages in Indian folk literature, such as this one: “To the Hindu the hemp plant is holy. A guardian lives in bhang . . . Shang is the joy giver, the sky flier, the heavenly guide, the poor man's heaven, the soother of grief . . . No god or man is as good as the religious drinker of bhang. The stu dents of the scriptures of Benares are given bhang be fore they sit to study. At Benares, Ujjain and other holy places, yogis take deep draughts of bhang that they may center their thoughts on the Eternal . . . By the help of bhang ascetics pass days without food or drink. The supporting power of bhang has brought many a Hindu family safe through the mis eries of famine.” Even in India there seems to have been some angry dis cussion about the possible value or danger of cannabis. The writer of the paean above alludes to the con troversy: “To forbid or even seriously to restrict the use of so holy and gracious a herb as the hemp would cause widespread suffering and annoyance and to large bands of worshiped ascetics deep‐seated anger. It would rob the people of a solace in discomfort, of a cure in sick ness, of a guardian whose gracious protection saves them from the attacks of evil influences ; . . so grand a re sult, so tiny a sin!” ISAPPROVAL of canna bis seems to have originated with the Christian mission aries and other Europeans. In a study of Hindu mystics, J. Campbell Oman noted that Christian missionaries often remarked, “Great numbers of Hindu saints live in a state of perpetual intoxication and call this stupefaction, which arises from smoking intoxi eating herbs, fixing the mind on God.” Dr.. George Morrison Car stairs, a professor at the Uni versity of Edinburgh and an authority on transcultural psy chiatry, lived in a village in Northern India in 1951 and was struck by the attitudes of the ruling castes toward the two most prevalent forms of intoxication there. The Raj puts, or warriors, drank darts, a potent, distilled alcohol from the flowers of the rnahua tree, and seemed to regard cannabis as fit only for sissies. The Brahmins, on the other hand, employed canna bis both in religious services and for social refreshment. Rajputs, of course, repre sent the temporal aristocracy, as Brahmins do the spiritual. Until the social reforms of 1948, the rajas of the Rajput class exercised autocratic rule over innumerable small ‐prin cipalities. In their upbringing, they were taught to put great stress on bravery and ferocitij in the face of danger, and, al though the test of real danger was seldom met, every young Rajput lived with the anxiety that some day he might not prove adequate to the occa sion. As a result, the Rajputs in the village tended to be boastful, touchy and inclined to assuage their anxieties with drinking bouts, Dr. Carstairs reported. Although ostensibly they prided them selves on drinking with dis crimination‐‐a ‐ fixed ration was allowed for each day— restraint tended to be for gotten in the course of an evening. The Brahmins unequivo cally denounced the use of daru, which they felt was in imical to their religious life— the first requirement of which was to “abhor meat and wine.” Interestingly, Carstairs found that the gentle priests were far more vitriolic in their reviling of daru than were the Rajputs in their uninter ested disdain for cannabis. The ruler of the village, a Rajput, thought himself a re ligious man and tried to reconcile his religious devo tion with his drinking. This was vehemently rejected by the Brahmins, one of whom said: “He is all wrong; he is a bogus lecher always busy with wine and women. How can he find his way along this stony and thorny path?” Brahmins in the village would often visit a nearby pilgrimage center, where the chief object of worship was a large, black stone phallic symbol representing the god Shiva. The god was often cited as being a bhang drinker, and the Brahmins would at tempt . to model themselves after him. In his visits to the temple, Dr. Carstairs would generally encounter large numbers of holy men stag gering about “stoned out of their minds.” Dr. Carstairs was struck by how similar Western Euro peans and Americans are, in their commitment to a life of action, to the Rajputs. All share an upbringing which values individual achievement highly and considers sensual indulgence to be not wholly wrong if enjoyed within so cially prescribed limits. The Brahmin theme of surrender ing volition is unfamiliar, threatening and distasteful to Westerners, except for the new drug generation. Because of this, Dr. Carstairs chided: “The present writer would have to say that of the two types of intoxication which he witnessed and in a meas ure shared, he had no doubt that that which was indulged in by the Brahmins was the less socially disruptive, less unseemly, and more in har mony with the highest ideals of their race;find yet so alien to his own personal and cul tural pattern of ego defenses that he much preferred the AFTER 500 A.D., cannabis began creeping westward from India, and references in the Persian and other Arabian literature began to appear. One of the most fascinating stories about the use of can nabis in Moslem cultures was told by Marco Polo about a secret cult organized in the 11th century by a Moslem religious leader, Hasan ibn‐al Sabbah. Since religion and philosophy in those days in the Moslem world were politi cal tools to be imposed by force rather than persuasion, Hasan trained his followers as an army and was success ful in capturing a number of fortresses. He is best known for refining the practice of assassination to an art—and herein lies the relevance. of this tale to cannabis, as well as an interesting dilemma for philologists. The assassins were special ly recruited young men in their late teens and early 20's, who were well‐treat ed, well ‐ paid and sworn to total allegiance to Hasan.

ibed a re markable garden that Hasan constructed at his major fort ress, the Alamut, where the young assassins were enter tained under intriguing cir cumstances: court a number of the youth: of the country, from 12 to 2C years of age, such as had a taste for soldiering . . . Then he would introduce them tc his Garden, some four, or six, or ten at a time, having first made them drink a certain po tion [hashish] which cast them into a deep sleep, and then causing them to be lifted and carried in. So when they awoke they found themselves in the Garden . . . “When, therefore, they awoke and found themselves in a place so charming, they deemed that it was Paradise in very truth. And the ladies and damsels dallied with them to their hearts’ con tent . . . “So when the Old Man [Hasan] would have any prince slain, he would say to such a youth: Go thou and slay So‐and‐So; and when thou returnest my Angels shall bear thee into Paradise. And shouldst thou die, nathe less even so will I send my Angels to carry thee back into Paradise.” Most philologists seem to agree that the • concept of assassination derives from Hasan ibn‐al‐Sabbah. There is however, dispute among them as to whether the word as sassin comes from Hasan or from hashish. Some maintain that hashish itself derives from Hasan. The descendants of Hasan survive today in colonies spread through Syria, Persia, Zanzibar and India. They are well‐known to Westerners be cause of the fame of their leader, who claims direct de scent from Hasan and is known as the Aga Khan. Can nabis must have been quite popular in the Arab world during the Middle Ages. For in the “Thousand and One Nights,” which represent folk tales collected between about 1000 and 1700 A.D., there are many references to bhang, which the Arabians called beng, as well as to hashish. ANNABIS was probably brought to Europe by Napo leon's soldiers returning from Egypt. At least it is well documented that in Egypt, he discovered widespread use of hashish, particularly among the lower classes. Napoleon issued a proclamation pro hibiting its sale or use. Between 1840 and 1860 in Paris, a distinguished group of writers — including Theo phile Gautier, Charles Baude laire and Alexandre Dumas— became fascinated by the hashish experience. Their written descriptions probably still constitute the clearest, most thorough accounts of the effects of the drug on the psyche. How did the “literary epoch” in the history of can nabis come about? Dr. Jacques Moreau de Tours, a prominent French psychiatrist at the Hospital of the Bicetre who became interested in treating his patients with the drug, introduced it to the popular author Gautier, who was 24 years old at the time. Gautier founded the famous Le Club des Hachichins at the Hotel Pimodan on Paris's Isle Saint‐Louis. There the patrons ate Dawamesc, a sweetmeat which had been advertised as an Algerian dessert delicacy to the romantic society of the ”Dumas anticipated Timothy Leary by 100 years in wrongly declaring cannabis an aphrodisiac.” day and which contained hefty quantities of hashish. The literary accounts of the club's members, accordingly, reflect high doses of cannabis. Gautier was the first to pub lish his experience, in a book called “Le Club des Hach ichins”: “After several. minutes a sense of numbness over whelmed me. It seemed that my body had dissolved and become transparent. I saw very clearly inside me the hashish I had eaten, in the form of an emerald which radiated millions of tiny sparks. The lashes of my eyes elongated themselves to In finity, rolling like threads of gold on little ivory wheels, which spun about with an amazing rapidity. . . . At cer tain moments, I still saw my ,comrades, but disfigured and grotesque, half men, half plants. The spectacle was so ridiculous that I writhed with laughter in my corner . . .” Alexandre Dumas was im pressed with how hashish en hances erotic sensations. He wrote this in “The Count of Monte Cristo” and thus an ticipated Timothy Leary by 100 years in wrongly declar ing cannabis an aphrodisiac: “And then followed a dream of passion like that promised by the Prophet to the Elect. Lips of stone turned to flame, breasts of ice became like heated lava, so that to Franz, yielding for the first time to the sway of the drug, love was as a sorrow and voluptuous ness a torture, as burning mouths were pressed to hi thirsty lips, and he was helc in cool serpentlike embraces.’ But cannabis is not reall3 an aphrodisiac. Since the drug makes perceptions more vivid, sex can become spec tacularly beautiful or, in SOME cases, hideously repugnant. LTHOUGH the expert. ence of the nineteen‐sixties ir the United States suggest: that the mind‐altering con• sumption of cannabis tends tc catch on and spread like plague, the chronicle of the plant's first 3,000 years ir other cultures bespeaks slower rate. Before the Chris. tian era and until about 500 A.D., it was employed for this purpose almost solely in In dia, and to a lesser extent in China. In the next 1,000 years or so, it reached the Middle East and Near East. Only in the 19th century did it be come well‐known in Europe. And we must wait until the 20th century for it to reach the United States. Marijuana came to the United States from Mexico and Cuba. The weed was smuggled by Mexican laborers across the border into Texas. American and Mexican sailors were also go‐betweens, buy ing .the drug in the ports of Havana, Tampico and Vera cruz for $10 to $12 per kilo gram (2.2 lbs.) and selling it wholesale in New Orleans at $35 to $45 a kilogram. The consumers in New Or leans were largely the poor and the Negro population. When reporters of The New ‘Orleans Morning Tribune wrote a series on “the mari juana menace,” the stories that generated the most alarm were those claiming that large numbers of teen‐agers smoked “mootas,” New Orleans jar gon for marijuana cigarettes. The superintendent of the city's Children's Bureau told reporters that he felt many problem children living at the bureau had come under marijuana's influence (implic itly suggesting that it had made them problem children) and that two of them had run away because they couldn't get their “muggles” (another slang word for marijuana) there. At this stage, only 16 states had laws against the sale or use of marijuana, and these were laxly enforced. This was, after all, the era of Prohibi tion, and the police had more pressing matters to attend to. In the mid‐thirties, how ever, a major crime wave struck New Orleans. Search ing for some explanation for an outbreak of holdups, one which, it was hoped, would not expose police inadequa cies, Frank Gomila, the Com missioner of Public Safety, concluded: “The crime wave unquestionably was greatly aggravated by the influence of this drug [marijuana] habit. . . . Youngsters known to be muggle‐heads’ fortified them selves with the narcotic [sic] and proceeded to shoot down police, bank clerks and casual bystanders. . . .” And state narcotic officers reported that in 1936, “60 per cent of the crimes committed in New Or leans were by marijuana users.” Soon newspapers through out the country had taken up the story and sparked na tional concern. Nevertheless, neither the public nor law enforcement officers truly considered marijuada a seri ous problem. One index of how feebly the laws were en forced was the very low price of marijuana products, indi cating that there was little risk of arrest from its sale. Even the Treasury Depart ment in 1931 minimized its importance: “A great deal of public in terest has been. aroused by newspaper articles appearing from time to time on the evils of the abuse of marijuana, or Indian hemp . . . This pub licity tends to magnify the extent of the evil and lends color to an inference that there is an alarming spread of the improper use of the drug, whereas the actual in crease in such use may not have been inordinately large.” Still and all, the continued publicity gradually pressured the Treasury Department's Bureau of Narcotics into draft ing a national law: At the same time, the bureau con ducted a national campaign against the drug, working with state legislatures in de veloping state laws for the regulation of marijuana, and providing information for magazine articles about the threat. . Harry Anslinger, the United States Commissioner of Nar cotics, himself wrote articles designed to “educate”—and terrorize—the readers. For in stance, in one piece he re ported: “An entire family was mur dered by a youthful marijuana addict in Florida. When offi cers arrived at the home they found the youth staggering about in a human slaughter house. With an ax he had killed his father, mother, two brothers and a sister. He seemed to be in a daze .. . He had no recollection of hav ing committed the multiple crime. The officers knew him ordinarily as a sane, rather quiet young man; now he was pitifully crazed . . . The boy said be had been in the habit of smoking something which youthful friends called ‘mug gles'. ...” It is remarkable how many times potheads are referred to as “addicts” in the popular literature of the twenties and thirties, despite medical evi dence, available then, that marijuana is not addictive. As to the details of Anslinger's lurid account, it takes little psychiatric acumen to appre ciate that such a crime would not be committed by someone who was “ordinarily sane.” The proposed Marijuana Tax Act never faced any grave danger in Congress, since marijuana smokers of the nineteen‐thirties‐‐ the under privileged black derelicts of society—were not represented in the hearings held in Con gress prior to the final vote. The Congressmen were, more over, assured by a Treasury spokesman that the bill would in no way “interfere mate rially with any industrial, medical or scientific uses which the plant may have.” The reason that the Treasury felt that “'medical uses” would not be interfered‐ with was simply that the medical pro fession rarely used the drug at the time. Unlike the Har rison Narcotics Act, which made morphine ‘ and related narcotics available to physi cians, the Marijuana Tax Act effectively banned cannabis as a medicine as well as ‘ an in toxicant. Narcotics Commissioner An stinger was the star witness at the hearings on the bill.. He recited the well‐worn tale of Hasan, hashish and the assassins. He introduced news paper clippings that claimed cannabis caused crime, addic tion and loss of reproductive powers. He said that it led to a “delirious rage after its administration” and that pro longed use invariably pro duced “mental deterioration.” With such impressive testi mony, the bill sailed smoothly through committee. Only two minor inconveniences arose during the hearings. One had to do with the bill's provision that the seeds of the plant as well as the. flowering tops which smokers used should be outlawed, because the seeds contained a small amount of the intoxicant and might be used for smoking. Violent ob jection to this provision came from, of all places, the bird food industry. A representa tive of this industry appeared at the last minute in a rather excited state because, as it turns out, the bird‐seed indus try at that time was consum ing about four million pounds of cannabis seed each year. He observed that “it is a necessary ingredient in pigeon feed, and we have not been able to find any seed that will take its place. If you substi tute anything for the hemp it has a tendency to change the character of the squabs pro duced.” Congressman Dough ton of North Carolina was curious about whether pigeons get stoned on pot. The manu facturers’ representative an swered, “I have ‘never noticed it. But the seed does have a tendency to bring back feath ers [which have fallen out] and improve the bird.” The upshot was that the Govern ment modified the bill. Since sterilized seed would do just Does a less aggressive national ethos lie ahead? as well for pigeon feed, but could not be used to grow the intoxicating plant, an amendment was passed ex empting sterilized seed. A less amusing series of objections to the bill re mained. The final witness was Dr. William Woodward, the legislative counsel of the American Medical Associa tion. This extremely conserva tive organization might be counted on to throw its weight behind a law to stamp out a purported men ace to the nation's health. Accordingly, the Congressmen and the Narcotics Bureau must have been surprised by Dr. Woodward's testimony. He not only proceeded to criti cize the provisions of the bill which were to deter future investigations into cannabis's medical uses, but also was harshly critical of the com mittee's procedures for ob taining evidence: “We are referred to news paper publications concerning the prevalence of marijuana addictidn. We are told that the use of marijuana causes crime. But yet no one has been produced from the Bu reau of Prisons to show the number of prisoners who have been found addicted to the marijuana habit. An informal inquiry shows that the Bureau of Prisons has no evidence on that point. “You have been told that schoolchildren are great users of marijuana cigarettes. No one has been summoned from the Children's Bureau to show the nature and extent of the habit among children. An inquiry of the Children's Bu reau shows that they have had no occasion to investigate it and know nothing partic ularly of it.” Caught unawares after what had been a notably placid se ries of sessions, the Congress men proceeded to badger and browbeat Dr. Woodward, questioning his qualifications (he was both a physician and a lawyer and spent five years working with the A.M.A., the Bureau of Narcotics and the American Pharmaceutical As sociation drafting a uniform narcotics act). “If you want to advise us on legislation,” one committee member fumed, “you ought to come here with some constructive proposals rather than criticism, rather than trying to throw obstacles in the way of something that the Federal Government is” trying to do.” Needless to say, the Mari juana Tax Act was passed by Congress — originally with a maximum penalty of a $2,000 fine and/or • five years in prison. In 1956 penalties for sale or transfer were increased to a five‐year mandatory sen tence, and a third offense could bring prison sentences of up to 40 years and fines of up to $20,000. (In October,1970, however, Congress passed leg islation that raised penalties for professional pushers, but allowed more lenient treat ment of others caught selling drugs, including pot. The law also cut the maximum penalty for those simply possessing marijuana to one year—a sen tence that may be suspended —and permitted the judge to expunge the offense from the records in cases of first of fenders.) 0 NE conclusion we can draw from this brief history is that marijuana means dif ferent things to different cul tures.‐ It may be an essential to the Hindu, who values, above all else, the experience of nirvana. Yet the same drug seems anathema to the hard driving, traditionally prudish American. As cultures change, so may their attitudes toward mind‐altering substances such as marijuana and alcohol. A thousand years ago bhang was almost a sacrament in In dia. Today, India is becoming more Westernized and the Government, reacting to in ternational pressures, has im posed some legal controls on hashish. In contrast, the United States, so long the land of the Calvinistic work ethic— and of more or less covert violence—may be becoming a more introspective country. The younger generation is more concerned with here and‐now self‐awareness than with accumulating money for some future gratification. Hu manistic ethical considera tions, such as concern for one's comrades, are replacing abstract morality and com petitive individualism. All of this suggests a more contem plative, less aggressive na tional ethos, the kind that has existed in Eastern countries such as India for many years, fostered there, perhaps in part," by cannabis. 0""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Though it may be presumptuous to call this generous sum a sop, it is certainly less than a commitment. It may placate birth control advocates while salving the Congressional con science—but funds without laws will not reduce the population growth rate fast enough. Congress knows this, but timorously continues to subsidize local clinics and well‐meaning academicians. This is no substitute for a strong over‐all policy to thwart the individual license to over‐propagate. Three million new people each year, crowded into smaller and smaller areas, precludes long‐term solutions to some of our most press ing domestic problems. The prevention of overconcentration of people— though rarely mentioned—is in itself a major problem. The longer Congress tolerates this non‐policy drift, the harder, costlier, and less reversible it becomes. One can understand the reluctance of the individual legislator to cope head‐on with population control; for though the old moral, ideologic, and religious birth‐control ghosts linger only in the darkest corners of the capital today, they haunt the subcon scious of our Senators and Congress men. It may take self‐education, cour age, and initiative to change this state of mind, but sooner or later they will haVe to commit themselves. The present loose system of volun tary family planning might possibly be made to work with a maximum cash incentive and a minimum of law and guidelines; but though it is eco nomically sound, it would be risky in effectiveness and time, The ultimate necessity of legislation and guidelines for a strong population policy must be faced. Elected officials can no longer evade debating the ideologic issue of whether the indi vidual right to procreate, to the detri ment of society, is a basic human right and a fundamental freedom and whether it can be legally halted with out damaging the fabric of freedom. The limitation of family size by law seems less an infringement than a boon to individual civil liberty. Yet the ideologic controversy is just as intimidating to our’ lawmakers as the spurious issue of “religious freedom” which long obstructed even voluntary birth control. Our Congress is cognizant of the proscription by law of many human inclinations, just as personal, but less devastating to society than careless reproduction. There are many prece dents to support legislation to limit population growth. There are surveys which show the public favoring gov ernment responsibility in our papular tion dilemma, and there is consider able evidence that the psychological attitdde of Americans has adjusted to government intervention in their per sonal affairs (e.g., Social Security, child care and education, health, un employment, etc.). But even more reassuring to the more timid legislator Is the surprising acceptance by the public of abortion reforms. This reflects the feeling that population control is more a political credit than a debit today. There seems to be every moral and philosophical justification for legal population tion; its technical feasibility, Its eco nomic relief, and, on balance, Its polit ical acceptability. It need no longer be viewed as a sanctified issue separate and dif ferent—and should, be treated no dif ferently than other urgent national issues.

Humphrey.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A Modish Proposal,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/12/17/archives/a-modish-proposal-why-not-a-suicide-liberation-front.html,"Why Not a Suicide Liberation Front? One night on a radio show I asked the following question: “Do citizens in a truly free and democratic society have the right to commit suicide?” The question was off‐hand, I admit. hadn't thought very clearly about it. No one else had either. A police detec tive on the panel remarked that, in deed, attempted suicide was punish able under New York State Law. don't recall now what the penalties were (presumably they weren't capi tal), but such laws, if they exist, sure ly rank with Ptolemy's for arrogance and misconception. The question was not answered that night; I suggest, though, that it will have to be an swered before this century ends. If this were a Christian society, would hesitate to pursue the subject further. We Americans, however, have triumphantly rid ourselves of sin as working concept, whether cardinal or venal. Soteriology is irrelevant. After lives, except for the cryogenic sort, have been exploded. The right to sui cide, therefore, can be examined only as all questions in twentieth century America are examined—that is, rela tivistically, legally, personally. That night we were discussing over dose deaths among drug addicts. These were deplored by the panel: with some presumption, I thought, since we were all members of that great bourgeois Establishment, the Living. Yet these suicides represented free choice. The death wish thrives sin unusly in all of us: most sinuously, no doubt, in the addict. There are obvi ously many, who, faced with human injustice or boredom or crazy personal metabolisms, may choose—in fact, may yearn—to opt out. An overdose suicide is surely more pleasant than slit wrists or a header from the Verrazano Bridge. Yet costly mechanisms of government are tooled up for propaganda and suppression. Smoking may cause cancer; cholester ol may induce heart attacks, yogurt may be pernicious—and we legislate, forgetting the lessons of Amendment Eighteen. The Cpristian/Victorian strictures against abortion have been set aside, and abortion, after all, can be construed as murder. Yet we con tinue to persecute the suicide whose act impinges on no other life. After fair admonitions have been given, what right has our so‐called free society to interfere with the drug ad dict who shoots himself from one state of insensibility to another? On what grounds can suicide or attempted sui cide be deemed illegal? Does the state claim a right to the individual's labor or his continued presence as a sort of fief? I suggest that this is a petty crotchet: society resents the suicide's blatant rejection of the status quo; moreover, in a world postulated on euphemisms for death, suicide makes the unpleasant truth rather too readily available. It is, I think, simple bigotry, crystallized by custom—simple bigotry in an age when over‐population threat ens to make Malthus a Pollyanna. It may well be that by A.D. 2000, the state will be compelled, by public de mand, to provide clean, supervised fa cilities for suicide. I envision annual festivals (probably around Easter); competitions between various civic and social groups; extended day care centers. In a few decades, the suicide may be our only public‐spirited citizen. I am, however, firmly opposed to the free suicide of minors. Death, like Bach, is a complex and sophisticated affair. Even, of mature, experienced adults, very few can understand it fully. I do not favor a lowering of the suicide age to eighteen. Nor do I favor obligatory death education classes in our public schools or death, studies programs in our state supported uni versities. Death is a family matter; parental discretion should be exer cised. The present Administration is court ing disaster. A Suicide Liberation Front appears inevitable: the crisis that will ensue may well make the confrontations of the sixties seem like taffy pulls. The average suicide has far less to lose than, say, the average Black Panther. In desperation the S.L.F. may just decide to take our vaunted American society with it. suspeCt that Senators Fulbright and Javits, with their attacks on the ABM and defense spending, are undercover suicides, just biding their time. Yet, despite a few radicals, the ordi nary suicide is just another harmless fellow American; he seeks equal op portunity and a chance to do his own thing. Compromise, understanding, and, of course, a massive infusion of Federal funds are needed to defuse the coming show‐down. Certainly—in civilization that pretends to guarantee freedom and the pursuit of happiness —we Americans have a great deal to answer for.

Communes Spread as the Young Reject Old Values,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/12/17/archives/communes-spread-as-the-young-reject-old-values-communes-are-a-way.html,"BOSTON, Dec. 16—In remote valleys and canyons or clut tered city apartment houses, thousands of young adults, seeking economic advantages, social revolution, love, pot, God or themselves, are creating new life style in America.  Whether the arrangement is called a commune, a colony, a cooperative, an affinity group or a family, these young adults have some form of shar ing in common, and they re ject the traditional style of living that groups people to gether largely because of blood or legal relationships. It now is becoming clear that the commune phenomenon, which began most recently in the late nineteen‐sixties with the hippie movement, is grow ing to such proportions that it may become a major social fac tor in the nineteen‐seventies. Nearly 2,000 communes in 34 states have been turned up by a New York Times inquiry seeking to determine how many permanent communal liv ing arrangements of significant size could be found in the country, why they existed and who lived in them. That number is believed to be conservative because it no doubt missed some smaller communes and does not include hundreds of small, urban co operatives and collectives. Several generalizations about the new life style were found, including the following: ¶No accurate count exists, largely because official agen cies—except the police, who watch urban collectives and communes for narcotics—gen erally ignore the development. In addition, most are quiet and sometimes secretive, and thus go unnoticed by neighbors. ¶The average size of a com munal group ranges from 5 to 15 persons, usually in their late) teens or early 20's, but increas ing numbers of groups whose members are over 30 are being reported. ¶All involve sharing space and finance and most go be yond this to share common work, goals or ideas. Others share themselves. ¶Despite general fears or as sumptions, few successful group living arrangements are built around narcotics or promis cuous sexual relations, al though both exist in some de gree or other. But these attrac tions are too readily available outside the group to provide the basic cement. ¶Although communal living experiments are common throughout American history (such as Brook Farm, an inte lectual experiment in 19th‐cen tury New England), few of the modern experiments have stud ied those historical roots. They regard themselves less as ah experiment than, as a member of a West Virginia group ex pressed it, “a path from things as they are to things as they should be.” In such states as California, where communal living has be come commonplace and is be ginning to involve upper‐mid dle‐class elements, there is rising official response to the phenomenon. Albert Solnit, chief of ad vance planning for Marin County, which has several dozen hippie‐style communes and will soon have a city of 20,000 for those who wish to live communally, recently called the movement to the at tention of the American Insti tute of Planners. ‘New Life Style’ “Here,” Mr. Solnit says, “is a new life style that has dropped the idea of mother and father, dropped the single family living unit, dropped the idea of commuting to work, dropped the 40‐hour work week.” “And yet,” he continued, “we're still going to confer ences to learn how to mediate with the land‐rapers and de velopers. We're still thinking in terms of 1954 subdivision patterns.” Regardless of the specific drives that bring a group of unrelated people together in a family‐style living arrange ment, there seems to be an underlying motivation that suggests the new styles of liv ing are more than a passing phase. Dr. Louis West, chairman of the department of psychology at the University of California at Los Angeles, regards the commune phenomenon as one of three overlapping rebel lions that the young have mounted against established society. The three rebellions, which he labels red, black ‘and green, are, respectively, against the economic and governmental system, racism, and.living style and conditions. Suburbs Rejected Dr. West says the green re bellion, is, among other things, a rebellion against the “sterile family and community life style of the suburbs, which produced most of these young people.” Current efforts to escape the mold cast by social arrange ments break down into two basic trends—urban and rural group living, experiments. The urban experiments are by far the largest. San Fran cisco, Chicago, Boston, New York, St. Louis and other large cities report “literally hun dreds” of such communes or collectives. Most of these are, to one degree or another, re sponses to the crowding and acute housing shortages in urban areas. Probably the largest single group of communal living groups, and the type account ing for the rapid growth of the experiments, are those built near colleges and universities. Surrounding nearly every major college and university are houses in which the walls have been knocked down to make community rooms where, stu dents can live as one family. “We're trying to share our lives and ideas in a way never possible in a dormitory or in separate apartments,” a Har vard graduate student living in one of the Cambridge com munes said. “It's an attempt to be truly human beings in the way we've always been taught to believe human beings were supposed to live with one an other—with love and under standing.” There are more practical reasons, too. ‘A group of three, six or 10 people sharing the rent can considerably reduce the cost of living for a student. It also eliminates the need for so many cars, telephones, tele vision sets and radios, thus reducing pollution and striking a blow at an economic system based on duplicate consump tion. Overlapping these college. based communes is a group of revolution ‐ oriented communes. These are usually composed of students or former students liv ing together in collectives formed around the desire to change specific aspects of so ciety. They include the women's liberation communes, political communes and those devoted to a specific but limited change. Others work in draft counsel ing, day care centers and birth control and abortion clinics. A third urban arrangement is built around common work sit uations and includes the fol lowing groups: ¶Cincinnati Health Depart ment employes campaigning for a more efficient administration. ¶Former nuns of the Glen mary order working with Ap palachian whites In the moun tains of Kentucky and Tennes see. ¶Young men trying to de velop counter‐culture programs for the state of Maine in an attempt to prevent destruction of the state's open lands and shores. ¶The staffs of underground newspapers, which have sprung up in nearly every large city in the country. In most of these urban oriented communes, access to supplemental incomes keeps their members in the cities. Many are on welfare, rolls or receive Federal food stamps that contribute to the commune larders. Others work at odd jobs or at temporary jobs, which are much, easier to find in the city. Religious Principles A fourth urban gimp is made up of collectives or com munes built on philosophical or religious beliefs: In Iowa City, 10 adults—including a police man—and four children share a house in which they “live simply by Christian principles.” In New Orleans, a woman called Kumi Mantreya heads a Buddist commune. In Cam bridge, a “lewd” commune has a nudist orientation. Despite occasional disturb ances, most urban communes seem to operate with little pub lic reaction. The police occa sionally raid them, searching for narcotics or runaway chil dren, but generally the police report little real trouble from communal living. The rural counterparts of these urban communal groups are less numerous, but they indicate a deeper commitment to the concept and are gen erally based on spiritual values or searches for utopian lives. New Mexico became so over crowded with rural communes that members of the first groups there have pleaded through underground media for others to “do your thing where you are; there's no more room here.” Although there are hundreds of rural communes in the Southwest and California, where the weather is usually mild, few people took the movement seriously until com munes begain to crop up in the North — and the inhabi tants stuck it out through bitter winters. Several communes in Vermont and at least one in northern Maine are going into their second winter with no indication of giving up. Probably because these young people are deep into the “work ethic” — they build homes, manage farms, sell handicrafts and some even operate gen eral stores — they are gen erally accepted, or at least tolerated, by their rural neigh bors. Many of the communes rep resent major investments. The following groups are some ex amples: ¶Near Nashville, Ind., Rain tree Investments involves 500 acres that are farmed organ ically — without chemicals. Pests are controlled by birds, ladybugs and praying mantises. ¶Three Black Muslim com munal farms are operating in Alabama despite harassment by whites who, at one point, apparently poisoned a dozen of their cattle. ¶The Children of God,” based on conservative Christian principles, has organized three communal farms, one each in California, Texas and Kentucky. ¶In Florida's Orange County, a school for children with be havorial problems operates com munally and is moving toward self‐sufficiency through farming and handicraft sales. Learning to Relate Both urban and rural, the idea of communal living has grown in the last two years at such a rate that many involved in these experiments suggest the energy devoted to the movement is largely responsible for the relative quiet that has settled over the under‐30's pro testers of recent years. One student put it this way: “People are trying to get it to gether in their own communes this year. The movement has to reform itself to make way for things like women's libera tion, and commune members have to learn how to relate to each other in a new situation.” Mr. Solnit, the California planner, compares communal living to a movement toward a new and permanent life style: “A kind of new social fron tier for the disaffected of the last third of the 20th century. Instead of claiming new lands, as the pioneers of the eighteen‐ hundreds did, they are claiming new human relationships. Just as the pioneers left established settlements behind, so these communicants have left estab lished ties of family by blood line, marriage, class, race, occu pation or anything else that boxes one in.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CITY AIDE REPORTS ON FETUS SURVIVAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/12/19/archives/city-aide-reports-on-fetus-survival.html,"The director of Maternity and Newborn Services for the ??ity's Department of Health said yesterday that 26 fetuses had remained alive after legal abortions in the city since July.  Most lived only for a few minutes, said Dr. Jean Pakter, although one survived and was placed for adoption. Several of the fetuses were beyond the 24‐week gestation period, which is the legal limit for abortions here. The period of gestation had been miscalculated in some cases while in others the abor tion had been performed to save the life of the mother, she added. Dr. Pakter described as “hys terical” a statement earlier this month by the state's 30 Roman Catholic Bishops, who declared that “crying” fetuses who were aborted were “dropped into surgical trash cans” by physi cians. Any fetus that showed signs of life after an abortion had immediately been placed under intensive care, Dr. Pakter said. In most cases, she added, the fetus showed slight muscular movement or heart beat before dying.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
STATE REVIEWING ABORTION SERVICE,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/12/19/archives/state-reviewing-abortion-service-studies-fee-and-advertising-of.html,"State Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz said yesterday that his office was investigating abortion referral services in the state as the result of com plaints from several out‐of state women.  The activities of 15 com panies in the metropolitan area that have served tens of thou sands of women since the lib eralized abortion law took ef fect July 1 are being reviewed as are those of physicians and several private hospitals and clinics. The major complaint against the commercial referral com panies is that they advertise deceptively and do not tell the women the true cost of their service. The other parties are being investigated for their role in fee–splitting. In State Supreme Court yes terday, the Abortion Informa tion Agency of 160 West 86th Street, sought to set conditions for presenting its books as de manded by the subpoena ob tained by Mr. Lefkowitz's of fice on Nov. 30. Wickersham Hospital, at 133 East 58th Street, took the same action Thursday. Both the agency and the hos pital are trying to keep confi dential the identity of women who have used their service. This week the state presented its show–cause argument asking why the information should be confidential. The agency is due in court Monday to answer that argument. Generally, a woman calls the referral service and is told to send a registration fee. (In the case of the Abortion Informa tion Agency, the fee is $10 and is not returnable.) The service then sets out to find a bed in a private hospital and a doctor. The patient pays a flat fee, based on the length of pregnancy and the abortion procedure, and is then admit ted into the hospital. Since the service can guar antee that beds will be filled, the rate the service pays is often cheaper than the going rate for an abortion. The service pays the doctor, the hospital, the anesthetist and the laboratory fees and keeps the remainder of the money, which in some cases has been as high as 26 per cent of the fee. It is this prac tice that is the crux of the in vestigation. “We are not against abor tions and we see the need for referral,” said Stephen Mindell, assistant attorney general in charge of the investigation. “We are concerned with the commercialization of abor tions.” “We are not saying that these women are not getting their abortions from licensed doctors, and there is no evidence that the abortions are being performed illegally,” Mr. Min dell said, continuing: “What we are concerned with is that women, especially scared women from out‐of‐state may be paying more than a fair and reasonable rate for abortion re ferral. We are concerned that many proprietors of these serv ices have had no medical training whatsoever. They are businessmen, and we are con cerned with the conditions of the hospitals these women are being sent to.” The Attorney General's office is questioning the accuracy of statement in a brochure of the Abortion Information Agency, which has served 17,000 clients since July, that tells prospective patients: “$10 registration fee. No extra charges ever.” An itemized bill of the com pany, however, shows listing for administration and insur ance, with the notation that in surance coverage for major and minor complications may arise. The attorney for the Abor tion Information Agency, Arthur H. Sobel, said he did not object to the investigation, but he charged that the At torney General's office was being “sanctimonious.” “Ideally, women's lib would like to see free abortions for everyone, but I don't think that will happen,” he said. “We are providing a big service. We are guaranteeing a woman a bed in an accredited hospital. If New York City or New York State had a clearing house — one phone number that anyone could call — we would be out of business.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Poll Finds Shift to Left Among College Freshmen,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/12/20/archives/poll-finds-shift-to-left-among-college-freshmen.html,"A survey by the American Council on Education on the current thinking of entering college freshmen shows that more than 36 per cent con sider themselves “left or lib eral,” while the conservatives are losing ground.  The report showed that the percentage of those favoring legalization of marijuana has almost doubled since 1968 to 38.4 per cent. Only 14 per cent of those surveyed smoked cigarettes, while 56 per cent said they drank beer. There was an increase of from 6.9 per cent to 9.8 per cent of those who had no re ligious preference, although more than 87 per cent of the freshmen said they attended religious services. The survey, released yester day by the council in Wash ington, was based on 180,684 freshmen in 275 public and private institutions. It was directed by Dr. Alexander W. Astin, director of the Council's Office of Research. The Coun cil is a nonprofit research and advisory organization rep resenting most colleges and universities. ‘Far Right’ Declines On the matter of political preference, 3.1 per cent de scribed themselves as “far left” while 33.5 per cent selected “liberal.” “Conservative” or “far right,” which 22.9 per cent selected last year, was selected by 18.1 this year. The report said there were more “liberal” students enroll ing in the four‐year institutions than in the community and junior colleges. It was also noted that despite the reported over supply of teachers, there was no indication that students were transferring out of edu cation. The percentages of students favoring careers in seven fields, with 1966 figures in parentheses, are: business 16.2 (14.3); arts and the humani ties 12.7 (13.1); education 11.6 (10.6); engineering 8.6 (9.8); social science 8.9 (8.2); bio science 3.5 (3.7); and physical science 2.3 (3.3). The freshmen do not seem to think that there was as much of a generation gap between them and their parents as is widely believed. Only 18.3 thought such a gap existed. Freshmen Increase The total number of first time, full‐time freshmen on all campuses was estimated in the report to be 1.63 million, or an 8 per cent annual increase from 1966 when there were 1.16 mil lion. The percentage of men and women was about the same as in 1966, with the men at 54.8. The percentage of white stu dents declined from 90.7 in 1966 to 88.6 this year. The non‐white enrollment rose from 108,000 to 186,000 over that period. Financial support for the freshmen year was 55.3 per cent from parents, 37.3 per cent from personal savings or employment, 21.7 from repay able loans, and 17.6 from schol arships, grants or gifts. The percentage of those who thought there was a good chance of marriage while in college was 7.7 per cent, but the chances one year after col lege rose to 19.2. Information on birth control by the Federal government was recommended by 66 per cent, while 44.4 per cent thought the government should offer a tax incentive for birth control. Eighty three per cent favored legal abortions. Slightly more than 71 per cent thought that base pay of the faculty should be based on student evaluation, while 91.4 thought students should design the curriculum.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CITY AIDE REPORTS ON FETUS SURVIVAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/12/20/archives/city-aide-reports-on-fetus-survival.html,"The director of Maternity and Newborn Services for the city's Department of Health said yesterday that 26 fetuses had remained alive after legal abortions in the city since July.  Most lived only for a few minutes, said Dr. Jean Pakter, although one survived and was placed for adoption. Several of the fetuses were beyond the 24‐week gestation period, which is the legal limit for abortions here. The period of gestation had been miscalculated in some cases while in others the abor tion had been performed to save the life of the mother, she added. Dr. Pakter described as “hys terical” a statement earlier this month by the state's 30 Roman Catholic Bishops, who declared that “crying” fetuses who were aborted were “dropped into surgical trash cans” by physi cians. Any fetus that showed signs of life after an abortion had immediately been placed under intensive care, Dr. Pakter said. In most cases, she added, the fetus showed slight muscular movement or heart beat before dying.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Media and Male Chauvinism,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/12/22/archives/the-media-and-male-chauvinism.html," One glance at the masthead on the opposite page is sufficient to reinforce the irony of a feminist writing anything in the pages of The New York Times. When C. Wright Mills included The Times in his listing of the Power Elite, he neglected to say (although it ought to be obvious) that The Times, with its brother listees, was/is dominated by rich white heterosexual males. In the United States of America, if you are poor, non‐caucasian, homosexual, and/or especially, female, you are, by all past definitions, less than human and by all present ones dangerous as well. The growing repression clearly shows the basic means by which white male imperialism intends to try and keep “those People” from a righteous rebellion. With women, how ever we see the Man trying to use a special tactic in addition to the usual brutality: co‐optation. (The Times can congratulate itself on the liberalism of “permitting” such dissent in its pages—and thus retain the ability to “permit” what is a human right.) Women struggling for their libera tion have always been good for a laugh. The history books Snicker about those crazy old ladies in bloomers; but did you know that the news jour nal published by Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton in the late 1800’s was titled Revolution? We have always been good for a patronizing smile and even a modicum of agreement—if We ask for things like nice, ladies should, and if our demands require no basic change and do not threaten the phallic imperialism that is out to destroy the entire planet. And this is where, today the media come in to manipulate, ridi cule, and co‐opt. Like The Times, all mass magazines (both general and “for women”) are male‐controlled. So is the electronic media; you sometimes see a token fe male. TV reporter now (usually a Third World woman—two oppressions for the price of one salary), but men still own the networks, write the news, determine the coverage, emphasis and analysis, and decide the programming, no matter how strong the rumbling of anger from the women themselves who work within those institutions. This leaves the Women's Liberation Movement with a difficult dilemma. Women as women do not even have the tactical advantage (from an organ izing—and military—viewpoint) of a ghetto situation. We are isolated from one another by the nuclear family structure, by cultural conditioning, and by the very real barriers of race, class, economic, age, and sexual preference (“Straight” sisters and Les bian sisters). Bow does a new move ment cut through that isolation to raise consciousness around the fact that women are viewed in the same basic roles—nurturer, sexual object, reproductive vessel, cheap or even free labor, etc.? Leafletting on New York's Lower East Side for ten years would not reach the housewife in Escanaba, Mich., but thirty seconds on the six o'clock new would. We were forced to use a medium which we knew was in the control of the enemy, which we knew would distort and truncate and ridicule our issues and politics. Even now, I am writing this in the context of The New York Times in order to reach still more women. By any means necessary means just that. But the Women's Liberation Move ment has grown at a fantastic rate. We no longer need to get the word out that we exist. Welfare mothers, nuns, airline stewardesses, housewives, women in the military, Playboy bunnies, professional women, prosti tutes, high‐school women, and grand mothers are moving against their op pression. We can afford to be more discriminating and demanding, and not only vis‐à‐vis the media. We can stop being grateful for the crumbs of reform and tokenism being offered us (reform abortion bills instead of outright repeal; government‐run day care centers instead of community‐con trolled, free, 24‐hour‐child‐care cen ters, etc.). We can (as, two‐thirds of the Wom en's Liberation Movement did) refuse to support an Equal Rights Amend ment which would have 1) thrown away protective labor legislation, 2) made it more difficult for a woman to get “alimony” (i.e.„ reparations for unpaid labor), 3) made women eligible for the draft (when neither men nor women should be drafted to fight genocidal wars). We can, and must, build a move ment that will not be based on gaining more privileges for those few women who already have some (white, upper and middle‐class and professional women—many of you, sisters, reading this) at the expense of poor white, Third World, and Working‐class women, but a movement which will fight for the needs of all women, the entirety of half the human population which has been subjugated and oppressed longer than any other people. It is not enough if Mrs. Sulzberger were, to take over from Arthur, although it might be refreshing. And as we refuse to be co‐opted into a female Right, 36 we must reject co optation from the male Left, which would create not a revolution, but a coup d'état between men. We are creating a revolutionary feminist move ment, from the cooperative child‐care projects in Detroit, to the housewives’ unions in California; from abortion referral, legal or not, everywhere, to the free Karate lessons for women in Boston, and the organizing of factory worker women in Louisiana. We are redefining our own political theory, our own sexuality, our own non leadership oriented structures. We are creating our own media: sisters, forget the “newspaper of the Man's record” and read Everywoman, It Ain't Me, Babe, Ain't I A Woman?, Off Our Backs, A Journal of Liberation, Good bye To All That, or Up From Under over breakfast. We are learning all forms of self defense, because we know that any alternative medium and alternative institutions are a stop‐gap survival measure until our total revolution lib erates not only ourselves but all peo ple—from sexism, racism, and the hun ger, war, and ecological disaster that results from the Man's competitive ness and greed. On that day, sister Charlotte Curtis of The Times's Women's Bureau, together with, say, sister Beaulah Saunders of the Na tional Welfare Rights Organization, might well assist in the liberating of The New York Times by a revolu tionary women's collective, bent on replacing the male hierarchical form with a collective egalitarian structure. Emmeline Pankhurst, the English feminist, said it perfectly in 1888: “Remember the dignity of your woman hood. Do not appeal, do not beg, do not grovel. Take courage, join hands, stand beside us, fight with us.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Letters to the Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/12/25/archives/letters-to-the-editor.html,"Tragedy and Guilt at Mylai To the Editor: I feel that the real significance of Mylai is being lost amid the sensa tionalism of the Lie??enant Calley trial. It is obvious that the military des perately needs a scapegoat for this atrocity which was somehow leaked to civilization; but does the Pentagon honestly believe that the court's de cision will make the slightest differ ence to anyone who examines the situation? When you train a man to lose his perspective on the value of a human life—i.e., to kill—you cannot then turn around and hold him responsible for doing what you have trained, nay, ordered, him to do. A human being is a human being, and the ones who were killed at Hue are no different from the ones mutilated by American napalm or machine‐gunned at Mylai; so that to punish Calley and honor the Green Berets is a grossly misguided act. The real defendant in this trial is not Lieutenant Calley, but militarism and its doctrines, not only of the United States but of the entire world. And the question is not of Calley's guilt or innocence, but whether or not the, responsibility for one of the count less horrors of a horrible age can be sloughed off on an individual. Lieutenant Calley's pawn‐like situa tion is tragic. Mylai is tragic. Vietnam is tragic. But until we, who are the truly guilty ones, realize the meaning of war, and begin to place a value on all life, there will be no end to the tragedies. DAVID L. DECOURCY New Haven, Dec. 7, 1970 • Experiments in the Schools To the Editor: Upon my departure from America on Dec. 6, I read a report in The Times of a speech by Dr. Ewald B. Nyquist, given at a conference for school ad ministrators, in which he commented upon the “informal British approach to schooling in which elementary school children essentially work on their own at whatever they desire.” Such statements are so far from the truth that it would be unjust not to draw the attention of your readers to the facts. Education on both sides of the Atlantic is undoubtedly experienc ing a desire for experimentation in methods and techniques, but as time proceeds, the lesson being learned is that caution needs to be exercised. It is true that a tiny minority of schools are experimenting with the techniques outlined by Dr. Nyquist. However, the teaching staffs of our secondary schools are already com menting upon the poor educational standards of pupils who have been through such primary schools com pared with pupils educated in a more conventional, manner. Should you allow your children to be educated by. this so‐called informal approach, you will find, alas when is too late, that your children will be expert at drawing pictures but will have no idea how to spell correctly or do mathematics. It is interesting how the 3,000 miles of water between our two countries acts as a barrier in obtaining the racts about the respective educational sys tems, for while you are being urged to adopt an as yet untried system of ele mentary schooling from our country, we are also being urged to adopt, as the acme of perfection, the American comprehensive system of education for our secondary schools. A modern ex ample of civilization rotating in ever decreasing circles. By all means undertake experiments, but please do not be obsessed with the dictum that because a thing is old it is of no further use and therefore has to be changed drastically. Remember you are affecting the lives of the following generation, and any failures in your experiments will not be discovered until it is too late for the errors to be rectified. • Creative Later Years To the Editor: Fordham University's denial of the Albert Schweitzer chair of philosophy to Paul Weiss on the ground that he is too old at age 69 is, not only an injustice to Professor Weiss person ally, but a great disservice to Ford ham's student body. Creativity in philosophy, as in such fields as art and music, continues well into the seventies and eighties. Restricting ourselves to American philosophers, for example, we notice that James Ward published his “Es says in Philosophy” at the age of 82; Ralph Barton Perry his “Realms of Value” at 78; George Santayana the “Realm of Spirit” at 77; William E. Hocking the “Meaning of Immortal ity in Human Experience” at 84; Al fred North Whitehead his “Modes of Thought” at 77, and John Dewey his “Common Faith” at 75 and his “Logic, the Theory of Inquiry” at 79. Still thinking and writing, Roy Wood Sellars, at 90, has just published a 400 ‐ page volume, “Social Patterns and Political Horizons.” Henry W. Sheldon of Yale, nearing 95, has pub lished within the past decade. It is to be hoped that the Supreme Court, itself the beneficiary of the erudition and counsel of octogenarians through the years, will render a land mark decision when the Weiss case reaches it—a decision to abolish dis crimination based on the foolish no tion that “chronologically old” and “mentally and physically incompe tent” are synonymous. • Still More on O.K. To the Editor: I distrust “au quai” as the origin of “O.K.” as much as I distrust Allen Walker Read's solution to the problem, published in The Saturday Review, July 19, 1941 (the Old Kinderhook Club of 1840) which my unabridged Webster's has adopted as gospel truth. Far more likely, it seems to me, is a derivation from the Spanish word hoque (pronounced okay), the short ened and more common form of albo roque, which my Vox dictionary de fines as: “treat stood by buyer or seller after closing a deal.” Words in Spanish beginning with “al” are Arabic in origin, which certainly makes this word antedate Old Kinderhook by many centuries. Any objections? If so, I would be glad to hear them. • ‘Thank You’ From Pakistan To the Editor: I have lost some of my relatives and many of my friends in the recent cyclone havoc in East Pakistan. World nations have come forward to help us. We are grateful to them. From here the United States is just on the other side of the world. But the way the brothers and sisters of America have helped us is unforgettable. We have lost many. But at the same time we feel that many are with us. Some of my American friends have individually helped. You helped us. We will always remember you with all respect. To the Editor: Dr. Edgar Berman correctly identi fied population growth as a major na tional concern in his Dec. 15 Op‐Ed article. I agree that the problem is great, but I disagree strongly with his proposal that family size be limited “by law.” I don't even want to raise the very practical question of how the United States or any Either country could im pose a family size limitation by law. The much proposed “something to put in the water supply” as a universal contraceptive exists only in imagina tion. In any event, the nation that failed to stop its citizens from drink ing alcohol would be foolhardy to think that the descendants of the Pro hibition generation would be unable to find speakeasy supplies of un treated water so they could have bootleg babies. Nor do I want to contest whether Dr. Berman's farfetched statement that “the limitation of family size by law seems less an infringement than boon to individual civil liberty” might not someday prove valid. The crux of the problem, it seems to me, is that we have never in this country seen the fulfillment of a truly voluntary system of planning our fam ilies. Too many couples have been un able to afford contraceptives, or have even been unaware of their existence. Social and cultural pressures have prevented too many persons from en gaging in realistic contraceptive meas ures and have kept nearly all men from utilizing that most sure and eco nomical of contraceptives, vasectomy. Most contraceptives are unreliable, or require substantial diligence and self discipline in use. And when an un wanted pregnancy does occur, we have until very recently denied the woman a choice of whether or not to terminate it. Even today, that freedom to choose depends on where you live and, to a large extent, on whether or not you have money. Why, in other words, propose limit ing births by law when so many people are having babies they didn't want? Dr. Berman says that we advocates of voluntarism want “more time.” Yes, we want ten years in the United States—a decade of a greater flow of funds into extension of family‐plan ning facilities, a decade of changing at titudes toward sterilization, a decade of liberalization of abortion laws, decade of research into better contra ceptives. We've just begun to be able to check whether voluntarism can work. Let's give it a fair chance to bring this country's replacement rate into balance in an orderly fashion. Developing countries will need longer—for the development of a truly practical contraceptive, for one thing. And, like it or not, at no time will it be productive for Americans to preach to the governments of the less developed countries on how to control their population problems. However, if we make voluntarism work, we can give them an example to follow. • To the Editor: The Times's fine innovation, Op‐Ed, is an excellent supplement to our nation's most distinguished editorial page. Particularly may I compliment you on the forceful Dec. 15 column by Dr. Edgar Berman, “We Must Limit Families by Law” and the Dec. 16 edi torial, “Controlling World Population.” These two articles reinforce well the warning that has already been issued by an impressive list of the world's leaders: Population growth is the globe's most far‐reaching prob lem, and its solution is the indispensa ble key to solving most of our other problems. The roster of those who have made clear that this is their conviction is veritable “World Who's Who”—such men and women, to name a very few who come to mind, as Secretary Gen eral Thant; World Bank President Robert McNamara; Presidents Eisen hower, Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon; Prime Ministers Gandhi and Pear son; Ambassadors Aldrich, Bunker, Draper, Galbraith, Keating, Riddle berger, Schmidt end Walmsley; scien tists Borlaug, Ehrlich, Mead, Muller, Northrop, Pauling and Urey. Recent enactment of the Family Planning and Population Research Act of 1970 adds the names of nearly 400 Congressmen to the active support of efforts at population control. Yet, as Dr. Berman says, we are still wedded to voluntarism—which is simply too slow to meet the crisis and is anyway negated by our present tax legislation and proposed welfare measures, both of which encourage childbearing. Let us now seriously consider limitation by law. • To the Editor: Beginning to have the public face the issue of population control, (via such articles as your Dec. 15 Op‐Ed column by Dr. Edgar Berman), is great and important need and public service. It is my hope that your paper will continue to present its reading public with issues faced squarely and “innovatively” for the sake of the long‐range public and human interest. • To the Editor: Edgar Berman's fascinating demand for compulsory birth control left out one important consideration. How can such a law be enforced? Will a pregnant woman be forced to have an abortion if the state decides she already has enough children or shouldn't have any at all? Or will every other man be steri lized? And when should it be done? At birth like circumcision? And who will decide? Dr. Berman?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Theater in London,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/12/27/archives/theater-in-london-the-ordeal-of-isabel-a-jezebel.html,"LONDON. EVERY seven or eight years, a show appears, swept up by some un stoppable zeitgeist which is destined to succeed no matter what obstacles are Put in its path. “My Fair Lady” was such a show; “Hair” was another. Almost as often, there comes a show so irremediably hexed that do amount of salutary gris gris can save it from catastro phe. Lionel Bart's “Twang” was such a show; so is the new musical “Isabel's a Jezebel.”  The postponed opening, the last‐minute cast changes, the defensive publicity — all of these are futile gestures when diabolical toxin is running in a show's veins. And when the pinched, cramped and withered creature finally sees the light of day, even obitu aries seem out of place. Con fronted with a victim of a jinx, one can only cross one's heart, jump sideways, spit three times and hope the ill natured demon has finally been sated. The high hopes of “Isabel's a Jezebel” (which gave its first squeals last spring in an unremarkable Off West End production) were based on the fact that its progenitor, Galt MacDermot, was also the composer of “Hair.” The choreographer, Julie Arenal, who gradually escalated into co‐director with Michael Wearing, was also a “Hair” alumnus, having staged the Swedish, London and Los Angeles productions of the musical. But compared with the hirsute extravagances of the original tribal romp, “Isabel's a Jezebel” suffers from alopecia. All of “Hair's” original impulses reappear as stilted imitations, and the choreography and staging try gauchely to animate a book which is irretrievably inert. But it is unjust to fracture this show (as most London critics have done) by bopping it on the head with “Hair.” This is a completely different creature, and intended to be. Bated loosely on a Grimm fairy tale, the show intersperses short, sharp rock numbers among a series of recurring scenes between Isabel and her deep‐spa lover. The couple spend all of their time either altercating or copulating. Round about the third or fourth repeat, one gathers that something rather weighty is intended on the subject of bringing children into a world committed to death. The repe titions are unfortunate in that they never allow us to forget the threadbare quality of William Dumaresq's script and the shallowness of his ideas. You are just recover ing from one blast when you get another helping of the same. Nor are the points strength ened by being sung after being stated. The book is so obsessed with obstetrics, hat pin abortions and foetal fatality, it suggests the work ings of a neurotic female mentality. There is a certain amount of wallowing in mor bid clinical detail and more than a hint of psychodrama in the obsessive preoccupa tion with mute mother‐figures and parental role‐changing. The only bright moments (two songs are certainly among them: “These Are the Things” and “It Just Can't Be That Bad”) come when MacDermot digresses almost entirely from the story line and drops in one of those poignant, syncopated jobs that he can do better than anyone else. The decision to reiterate rather than develop the show's material is laudable in theory, but defeating in prac tice. One can feel nothing for people that have not been properly introduced, and this is the show's elementary fail ing. It projects poignancy and passion through characters who have never really touched us in the first place, and so the effect is a little like being grabbed in the street by a total stranger and given an impassioned account of his nervous breakdown. The other miscalculation has to do with the balance between story and song. Song in musicals, can do many things. It can further the plot, elaborate character, recapitu late the action, arbitrarily digress, etc., etc. In “Isabel,” the plot marks time while the score either repeats what we have just been told or de livers highly diverting digres sions. Even when the songs are good, they subvert the show because, after the best peripatetic highs, one is re turned to a static situation with a bringdown as harsh as cold turkey. Carole Hayman replaced the lead just before the open ing night, which is a pretty hefty albatross to be slung around anyone's neck. She is a tall, gangly, scalene‐shaped girl with a head like cotton candy, and she brought nothing to her performance but a frantic attack and a sense of trying to rescue both baby and bathwater, unaware that the show's authors had provided neither. The rest of the cast, apart from Maria Popkiewicz whose musical repose hovered like an indict ment against the rest of the cast's frantic activity, was scrappily avant‐garde in the very worst East Village tra dition. Even John Napier's claustrophobic fish‐net set ting and inventive pop‐up furniture couldn't improve the footling shenanigans that took place in its midst.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Joan has hated New Year's Eve ever since she spent the holidays in Boonton, N. J., with her roommate from Wellesley, and her blind date for the evening, a boor from Princeton, climbed out the living room window when the lights were turned out at midnight ... leaving a frantic trail offootprints plunging across the snowy lawn. Stanley has hated New Year's Eve ever since the year he was 16, and was the only boy in his class not invited to Ivin Blumberg's party in his family's “finished” basement — “finished” (he later heard) in mauve and yellow leather to look like a Longchamps restaurant, and the scene of a minor orgy (at least for those days), with couples taking turns in the “unfinished” laundry room behind the mirrored bar. Though everyone assured Stanley he had been excluded because of jealousy —Ivin was an ugly runt, he was tall and handsome — nothing ever oblit erated the humiliation of that evening spent alone in his room while his parents kept the downstairs radio tuned, full blast, to Vincent Lopez playing “Auld Lang Syne” from the Hotel Taft Grill Room. He vowed he would never spend another New Year's Eve like that — and hasn't. Every New Year's Eve since then (with the exception of one spent in Seoul), has seen Stanley at some festive or uproarious or (on a few rare, happy occasions) orgiastic party. Ostensibly enjoying himself.  This continued without interruption when he married Joan, who had the same compulsion about the evening that he did. Their marriage was filled with many such affinities, and it flourished accordingly. When they had been married 10 years, they re ceived an invitation to the Strasbergs’ New Year's Eve party that dazzled but puzzled them: while Stanley had become a successful TV producer, he wasn't quite that successful or well known—but they somehow managed to overcome their qualms, and went to the party. The next year, when they received another invitation from the Strasbergs, they went again. The third year, when an invitation from the Strasbergs failed to arrive, Stan ley tried to be philosophical: they had twice reached the apogee of all possible New Year's Eves, nothing could top that ... surely the specters of “finished” basements and frantic footprints in the snow had been laid to rest forever, surely he and Joan could relax. But not so surely. After spending the next two New Year's Eves at home (having received no invita tions at all), in the following year he and Joan announced to all their friends that they were taking the twins and going to Barbados for what they were suddenly calling “The Hols,” to get far away from what they termed “The New York Night mare.” For the next four years they went to Barbados for The Hols. This year Stanley's father is hospitalized with leukemia, and since his doctor says he “could go at any time,” they won't be going to Barbados. And though Joan and Stanley have in formed everyone that they will be in New York over The Hols this year, they haven't, as of mid‐December, received any invitations for New Year's Eve. Not even from the Stras bergs. Though he is trying to hide it from Joan, Stanley has begun to feel the stirrings of his old Finished Basement Syndrome, and has begun talking to Joan about shipping the twins off to her mother in Buffalo and spending New Year's Eve in a friend's unused lodge in the Berkshires; they could (he enthused to Joan) welcome the new year in with a bottle of port in front of a roaring fire, far from The New York Nightmare—but not so far that a phone call couldn't summon him to his father's bedside in two hours. God forbid. Though Joan has said brightly that this sounded “just dandy,” she has begun having a re play of her own New Year's Eve syndrome, and doubts that being stuck off alone with Stanley in a remote cabin is going to help put it down. In fact, Joan has secretly de cided that if no invitations have turned up by Christmas, she is going to come down with one of those exotic new viri, that require quiet bed rest—and pharmacies that are only five minutes (as opposed to two hours) away. Martin and Felicia Osgood FELICIA and Martin are one of those childless couples whose years together (18), if plotted like a graph, trace a steady upcurve of supreme self‐interest. Their childless ness, cold‐bloodedly deliberate (Felicia had three illegal abortions in the early years), has given them the free dom — plus the built‐in alibi of “... you see, we have no one else to worry about”—to indulge just about every selfish craving imaginable: travel, real estate, extravagant clothes, etc. They consider them selves highly civilized, fastidious peo ple, and describe everything not up to their standards as being “tire some” and “disagreeable” (Martin), or “dreary” and “messy” (Felicia). These collective epithets apply to all holidays—particularly New Year's Eve, a night they find especially tire some and dreary, their joint assertion being that most people use the occa sion as an excuse for extremely disagreeable and messy behavior. For the last 10 years they have spent New Year's Eve at the theater. They have discovered that tickets to one of the hit shows are always available, the audiences are unusually decorous and well‐behaved, and—most impor tant—that somewhere in between the time they climb into their hired limousine and the moment they reach their doorstep, the New Year has slipped in. Unobtrusively. Last year, they did not get to the theater because an important client of Martin's (Martin is a lawyer), named Miles Allport, was giving a party, and Martin said that it would undeniably be tiresome, but they had to go. So they went, and it was tire some indeed — with a great mob of people suddenly shoving their way in at 11 P.M., and just as suddenly exiting a half hour later, leaving in their wake a ravaged apartment, and several messy drunks. That, at least, was how Martin saw it. What Martin did not know was that shortly after midnight, Miles Allport was showing Felicia the way to the maid's bath room (the front two were occupied by messy drunks), when he suddenly turned and violently kissed her, hoarsely muttering, “I've wanted to do that for five years!” Whereupon Felicia fell in love. Disastrously. Though the next two times Felicia (with Martin) saw Miles (with his wife, Sarah) at parties in following months, he was curiously cold and remote, Felicia finally realized that he was defending himself against his turbulent emotions. Which also ex plained his failure to call or contact her: if he gave way one inch to his violent feelings ... CHAOS. Delicious CHAOS, thought Felicia, who was suddenly not much given to using the word “messy.” While she has seen Miles only those two times during the last year, Felicia is convinced that if she manages to be where he is this New Year's Eve, Miles will not only repeat last year's memorable kiss, but will make some sort of declaration she can seize on. Build on. And though Martin has been after her since October to get tickets to “Wanda June” for New Year's Eve, she has not yet gotten them. She knows that she cannot hold out against Martin beyond a certain point, but she is hoping that before that point is reached, someone will in vite them to a New Year's Eve party. Someone who knows the Allports, too. Sarah and Miles Allport SARAH and Miles have been mar ried 19 years and have two children, Christopher, 18, and Penel ope, 17. Miles owns a small, success ful public relations firm, Sarah trans lates contemporary French and Italian novels into English. They are a thoroughly handsome, well‐liked pair, and they both have always loved New Year's Eve. It was actually on a New Year's Eve—at a costume party in a townhouse off Gramercy Park—that they met. Though each had previously enjoyed a score of happy New Year's Eves—Sarah at balls and parties, Miles at parties and Gogi's La Rue (Gogi's death has affected him ter ribly)—everything they had ever felt about that night climaxed in the moment when Miles, dressed as a red devil, encountered Sarah, dressed as Madame de Pompadour, on the staircase of that house. An utterly gay, glamorous evening, which (they later saw) was a luminous prefigure ment of all the gay, glamorous New Year's Eves they were to spend to gether in the next 15 years. For up until three years ago, there was never a New Year's Eve that the Allports weren't invited to at least four gala parties. Three years ago, when the first invitationless year came, they were stunned, but bravely decided it was because they had just moved and many people didn't know their new address—and went to the movies. The second invitationless year also briefly shattered them, but once again they rallied, and decided it was the perfect time to have a warm New Year's Eve celebration at home, with the children. So Sarah and Miles invited four of their friends, and Chris and Penny invited four of theirs. Sarah spent two days prepar ing a festive midnight supper—and 12 o'clock found them all in the dining room, six sober teen‐agers sternly watching six sodden “adults” (wearing gold paper hats) kiss, gobble caviar, pop balloons; finally, at Miles's remarkably restrained sugges tion, the six teen‐agers adjourned to Chris's room ... but not before Miles overheard Penny's boyfriend say to her: “Sure, it's pathetic, I agree you have to pity them—but how in God's live with themselves?” The third year, last year, Sarah and Miles decided to take matters in their own hands and give a party themselves. They sent Chris and Penny and their two new romances to Sugarbush for the New Year's Eve weekend, and invited 80 people to come at 9 o'clock for what the cute printed invitations described as an evening of “Mad Fab Fun.” By 10:20 only 14 people had arrived. At 10:50, 66 people arrived simultaneously. For the next half hour there was a gay, riotous jumble of sounds and colors, and Sarah the Party Girl, standing and happily sip ping champagne in a corner, thought, “O hail to thee, blithe spirit of the New Year!” No sooner had she thought this (it was 11:20 on the button) than there was a terrific surge toward the elevators, and when midnight struck there were 18 people left, none of them people that Sarah and Miles really liked—and Sarah was locked in Penny's room, Weeping. At 12:15, tight and near tears himself (what parties had they all rushed off to, and why hadn't he and Sarah been invited to any of them?), Miles was showing Felicia Osgood the way to the maid's bathroom, when, seized by a devilish impulse, he seized Felicia, muttering as he kissed her, “I've wanted to do that for five years!” What he actually meant was that for five years he had wanted to wipe that smug, supercilious look off her beautiful face— and with one horrified glance, he saw that he had succeeded. Terrified the ravening look in Felicia's eyes, then and each of the two times he saw her months later, Miles has done his best to avoid her ... but he has the crawling sensation that Felicia is simply biding her time, wait ing to pounce. Though he and Sarah haven't as yet received any invitations for New Year's Eve, Miles knows that his be loved Party Girl will go on hopefully waiting until the zero hour, and has decided to make reservations at Sugar bush for all of them this year —himself, Sarah, Penny, Chris, and their two long‐lasting romances. Better Penny's boy friend than Felicia Osgood! Simon and Pat Waters SIMON and Tat have been married 15 years and have three children—Sharon, 16, Karen, 15, Michael, 14. Simon is a painter, and for the first six years they were married they were very poor and very much in love, so they spent New Year's Eve at home, and once the babies were bedded down, they bedded down themselves, and welcomed the New Year with their favorite kind of celebra tion. By the seventh year, Simon was suddenly being acclaimed as one of the most talented young painters in The New York School, they were suddenly getting invited to a lot of parties—and since the old way of greeting the New Year was suddenly be ginning to pall, they went to the parties. For the next five years they averaged six New Year's Eve invitations a year, and usually made three out of the six parties. Then suddenly, like the Allports (whom they knew—Miles being one of the first young collectors to buy Simon's paintings), they found that the invitations had stopped. For two years they impro vised, that is, got together with a few other painters and their wives, and got drunk. By the third year they knew it was the recession, and not their social undesirability, since the sale of Simon's paintings, like the New Year's Eve invitations, had stopped. Worse: people were trying to unload his paintings, even at a great loss‐Last year, on the 28th of December, Simon was having a phone conversation with his dealer, Fred Godlieb, during which he learned the following things: (a) Miles Allport had been trying to get Fred to buy back some of Simon's paintings, and Fred had refused; (b) the Allports were giving a New Year's Eve party to which neither the Waterses nor the Godliebs had been invited; (c) the Godliebs had no plans for New Year's Eve; (d) Fred had just gotten his hands on a fresh packet of Tijuana grass. Before hanging up, Simon suggested that they all spend New Year's Eve together, at his place, and that Fred bring his‐grass. The Godliebs arrived at 11 P.M., and at 11:15 they all turned on. At 11:57 Elaine Godlieb was stretched on the couch, snoring, Pat was in the bathroom being sick, Fred was stretched out dreamily on the rug, and Simon, unzonked and suicidal, was sitting in a chair listening to Fred's wild sexual fantasies about Joan Platt (the Platts also owned some of Simon's paintings). At the stroke of midnight, Elaine, apparently wide awake all the time, leapt off the couch and struck Fred, Fred struck Elaine, Simon struck Fred, Elaine struck Simon ... thus ending the evening and the old year. This year, though mid ‐ December finds them without any New Year's Eve invitations, Simon says be is too depressed—about his painting, the state of the art market and the state of the world — to want to go out anyway. But Pat, who came into a small inheritance that enabled them to sur vive the last year, keeps telling Simon (in a menacing tone Simon doesn't care for) that he has to get a Positive Tropism going, and that forc ing himself to go out any where on New Year's Eve is the first step in that direction. In any case, Simon has a new dealer, and the last people they are likely to see on New Year's Eve are the Godliebs. Fred and Elaine Godlieb WHEN Fred and Elaine got home from the Waterses’ last New Year's Eve, their superintendent was run ning the elevator (the late shift operator had passed out in the mail room), and he was a very angry superintendent indeed: it appeared that their 10‐year‐old son, Peter, and his friend, Haggis, who was stay ing overnight, had spent the five minutes before midnight leaning out their 17th‐floor living room window (where there were no guard rails), dropping plastic Baggies filled with water on the doorman and passers‐by; at midnight, when either this palled or they ran out of Baggies, they began shouting at the surrounding lighted windows of Sutton Place (where the towering, enclosing walls acted as an amplifier): “Fascist pigs! None of you deserve to live another year!” It also appeared that while all this had been going on, their 18‐year‐old sitter had been on the kitchen phone with her boyfriend, who had called, collect, from San Diego. Elaine, who has just been through a rather traumatizing year with Peter, is determined not to go out and leave him alone this New Year's Eve, Fred, who has also been through a traumatizing year with Peter (which peaked for Fred when Peter's child therapist declared that it was imperative that he, Fred, go into “deep therapy” himself), Fred is equally determined to go out this New Year's Eve— out anywhere that is far away from Peter. Though each knows of the other's resolve, each is grimly determined that the other will lose out. In fact, at this juncture in their marriage, there is only one point on which they see eye to eye: wherever they end up spending New Year's Eve, they don't want to even think of the Waterses, much less be with them. Ever again. Kate and Gordon Furst KATE and Gordon have been married seven years. It is the second mar riage for both of them, and they each have two children from their previous marriages, all of whom have grown up and married themselves. (Thank God, thinks Gordon.) Though both of them have never particularly liked New Year's Eve, they have always felt it was important to go through the motions, and over the years have run the eve ning's complete gamut of pos sibilities (starting with eve nings at home alone, and ending with large parties). Like the Platts, Osgoods, All ports, Waterses and Godliebs (all of whom they know), they have had a dearth of New Year's Eve invitations for the last three years. Because Gordon is a stock broker, they knew right away it was the recession, not un popularity, and quietly spent the evening with old friends. Last year, though they finally received an invitation to a large party at the Allports', Gordon—who in the week be tween Christmas and New Year's dropped $43,000 in the market—was too depressed to want to see anyone. So he and Kate stayed home and took Nembutal and Seconal (respectively),. climbed into bed (severally), and were deep in comatose sleep when the New Year came rolling in. Like many stockbrokers, Gor don is an extremely super stitious man. Signs, symbols and auguries are everywhere. Though in last year's depres sion he temporarily forgot it, he has always believed that New Year's Eve is a night of powerful portents — and be lieves that the particular man ner and style in which one greets a new year has a pro found effect on just how that year will go. Gordon is now convinced that the dismal way he spent last New Year's Eve had everything to do with the disastrous year that followed — so disastrous that many people are whispering that he has been wiped out. While this isn't quite true—he still has an impressive folio of blue chip stocks in reserve—Gor don is thoroughly frightened, and is grimly determined to break the chain of bad luck that has been plaguing him. He feels that there is only one way to do this, and on the 12th of December says to Kate that he knows it's a little late but he would like to give an enormous New Year's Eve party. He does not burden Kate with an explanation: namely, that he is convinced that if he greets the New Year in an atmosphere of gaiety and celebration, there will be grounds aplenty for gaiety and celebration in the year that ensues. And though poor Kate could do with a little enlightenment (when she asks Gordon how they can afford such a party, he mischievously —or, she fears, maniacally— smiles, and says, “Let the blue chips fall where they may!”), she is relieved not to have to be alone with Gordon again, and accedes. With her usual efficiency, she manages to make all the necessary arrangements and get 50 invitations in the mail within two days. Since Gordon seems to attach a great importance to it, she hopes the party will be a suc cess—but she begins to pre pare him for disappointment. She says that she thinks it is a bit late and a lot of people will have other plans. She says that she also thinks a great many people have begun to go away for the holidays, and an even greater number of people are in no mood to celebrate anything this year and plan to ignore New Year's Eve. The turnout, she is warning Gordon (and herself), will probably be rather thin. But Kate is soon proved wrong. By Christmas, every one has answered the invita tions. Everyone accepts — with enthusiasm. There are a few unpleasant excep tions, people like Felicia Osgood, Miles Allport, Pat Waters and Elaine Godlieb, all of whom keep rudely asking who else is going to be at the party — but everyone else seems unusually grateful and excited, and says charming things, like Joan Platt, who gushes: “We'll be there with bells on, Kate! You couldn't have picked a better year to give a party!” And Kate has finally come around to thinking so, too. Though she is not sentimental about New Year's Eve, like the Allports, or compulsive, like the Platts, or super stitious, like Gordon, her original indifference has passed and she suddenly feels that attention must be paid to this night. She suddenly feels there is a lot to be said for the concept of sloughing off the old, and hopefully facing the new—yes, the Fresh Start Syndrome, but what is wrong with that? She feels that in times like these, in the second year of a new decade (which could turn out a lot better than the prophets of doom predict), there is something quite special about the ritual of turning to someone one knows and saying — with kisses or without—“A happy New Year! A happy ‘71!” Meaning it. * * * AND in a way, I'm right in there with Kate. Though I'm not sure about the Fresh Start Syndrome — there are limits, one feels, to optimism —and though I think there will be a few tense moments at Kate's party (which she'll probably be too busy—being involved in sloughing off the old, or whipping around to face the new—to notice), I think she's right about the ritual. More contact. We all need it. And since it doesn't look like I'll be making the party, I'll make my pitch now, and say, “A happy New Year! A happy ‘71!” Meaning it. I think. ∎",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
New School Help for Unwed Mothers,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/12/28/archives/new-school-help-for-unwed-mothers-special-programs-offer-new-aid-at.html,"Three years ago Karen was a senior in an inner city high school in Boston. She had many friends, and she was busy taking part in school activities and making plans for college. Then her world fell apart: She found out she was pregnant. “I was an ‘A’ student and always counted on going to college, but I thought that was all gone;” Karen said, re calling the period of shock and despair she had gone through. “I was either going to quit school or run away. I thought it was the end of everything.” It might really have been the end of everything for Karen if she had become pregnant a few years earlier, for up until the late nineteen sixties unwed teen‐age moth ers were usually expelled from school and left on their own. For most, that meant giving up on education, for some it meant going on wel fare. Slowly, however, atti tudes are changing. More and more communities through out the country, with the number of pregnant teen agers steadily rising, are starting to think of ways to help the girls instead of treating them as social pa riahs. Three cities—New York, Washington and Atlanta— have gone so far as to al low pregnant girls to remain in their home schools. But the most common answer to the problem is to set up a spe cial educational program out side regular classes but of fering parallel courses. There are now more than 140 such special programs for pregnant teen‐agers un der way in the United States, and it was one of them, the Centaum project in Boston, that went to Karen's aid. She heard about it from friends, enrolled, completed her high school education, and went on to college. Ac cording to the director of Centaum, Mrs. Julia Stern, Karen's case is not unusual: Many of the graduates go on to further schooling. “Some of the girls have gotten remarkable scholarships,” Mrs. Stern said. “One girl received a $2,450 scholarship to a well‐known Eastern college. Others have gone on to train for nursing, teaching and secretarial ca reers.” The programs vary in size and emphasis from city to city. Some operate out of neighborhood medical clin ics, others work with Y.W.C.A. facilities and a growing number use the school system itself as the focal point for the coordina tion of various types of med ical and educational services. Most of the programs are funded by the Board of Ed ucation and the Department of Health in the area they serve, but about one‐third re ceive partial funding from Federal agencies, princi pally the Office of Economic Opportunity and the Chil dren's Bureau of the Depart ment of Health, Education, end Welfare. Aid by Maternity Homes Before the establishment of the special programs, some pregnant teen‐agers could re ceive tutoring at maternity homes. However, Catholic Charities, the Salvation Army and the Florence Crit tenden League, which oper ate most of the maternity homes in the country, can serve only about 10,000 of the girls a year. The new programs are reaching about 40,000 a year. The rate of illegitimate births to teen‐age mothers has remained fairly constant since 1957 at approximately 16.5 per 1,000. But the ac tual number of such births is increasing. In 1960, there were 91, 700. By 1965, the figure had risen to 129,200. This year it is expected to reach 180, 000. Some Parents and students are quick to accept the new attitudes of tolerance toward unwed mothers. School offi cials in Los Angeles say that pregnant girls there are cit ing Mia Farrow and Vanessa Redgrave and talking about the new morality.” Many others, however, remain op posed. “There will always be a group of people who believe that these programs coddle the sinner,” said Dr. James Walker, director of a four year‐old program in Atlanta. “They feel a girl should be punished for having sexual intercourse and their idea of punishment is expulsion.” Although as yet commu nity opposition has nowhere grown strong enough to pre vent any of the programs from operating, educators are aware that a reservoir of public indignation is always close to the surface, and they are sensitive to its implica tions. In Azusa, Calif., outside Los Angeles, the Citrus Coun ty High School simply incor porated training for pregnant girls into its curriculum with out any formal announce ment. “I just did it and told people about it later,” said James Georgeou, principal of the school. Citrus is a special high school where students, to get extra credits or hasten their graduation, can agree to car ry out individual assignments outside school hours. Preg nant girls spend part of the day learning about maternal and child care problems and part of it in regular classes. “Many girls stay with us after they have their babies,” Mr. Georgeou said. “They bring the kids right into the classrooms. We line the bas sinets up next to the desks. It's really interesting to watch big husky boys turn into pussy cats, opening doors for the girls, fussing over the babies ...” In most cities, the largest proportion of students who participate in the special pro grams for pregnant girls are Negroes from poor families. The illegitimacy rate among young black girls is nearly 10 times that among whites. Studies show that a white student is more likely to get an abortion, to enter a ma ternity home and to give up an illegitimate child than her black counterpart. “Traditional white moral standards require that the girl disappear from home dur ing this so‐called time of shame, and often the girls never come back to school,” said Mrs. Vivian Washington, principal of the Edgar Allen Poe School for Pregnant Girls in Baltimore. “This is partic ularly disturbing on the jun ior high level. For black girls the motivation to stay in school is very much higher.” Nevertheless, there are many exceptions. In Dubuque Iowa, the program for preg nant teen‐agers serves prin cipally white middle ‐ class girls. In fact, there are only 11 Negro families in the en tire community of 63,500 people. “I have seen a marked change in parental attitudes about this program over the last few years,” said Don H. Henderson, vice principal of Dubuque Senior High School who helped to get the proj ect started. “The parents, are beginning to grasp the idea that it's a positive thing.” School officials are find ing that some students, espe cially those from overcrowd ed ghetto schools, suddenly take an interest in learning for the first time in their lives when they enter the special programs. “Classes are smaller and attention is magnified,” said Ernest Komer, director of the program for unwed mothers in Kalamazoo, Mich. “Teachers in our program are ‘hand‐picked,’ with the result that a few girls from Aid‐to Dependent‐Children families who might have never thought or going beyond high school are being ‘guided’ into college programs.” Psychological Counseling Along with educational courses, most of the programs offer psychological coun seling as well. In Pittsburgh, a psychologist meets with the girls in group sessions and each girl then sees him once a month for individual coun seling. Mary Curtis, director of Project Teen Aid in Brooklyn which onerates out of a hous ing project, feels that the “therapeutic milieu” of the programs is one of their most important aspects. “The girls come in here and they're up set,” she said. “Their mother is often furious and we end up acting as the mediator, The teachers, the public health nurse and the social worker all try to make the girls feel at home.” Some psychiatrists and school administrators say that the psychological make up and home life of a girl is an important factor in whether or not she will be come pregnant. For this rea son, a high percentage of the programs concentrate on helping the girls improve their self‐image rather than emphasizing questions of mo rality. Other authorities say that ignorance about sex and ado lescent immaturity are more often the reason. Most of the programs include some infor mation on sex education and birth control. But many ad ministrators concede they have a hard time “selling” the girls on birth control. It is too early to determine whether the liberalized abor tion laws recently enacted in some states will have a sig nificant impact on the lives of pregnant teen‐agers. Project Teen Aid adminis trators in Brooklyn said they saw no decline in the number of girls who were applying for their program. “There's no drop‐off at all,” said Miss Curtis. “Nine times out of 10 the hospitals re quire parental permission for the operation and most mothers and fathers don't want to give consent for girls in this age group to have abortions.” Because few of the pro grams are more than two or three years old, not many studies have been done to measure their success rate, particularly with regard to the number of subsequent pregnancies. However, one study con ducted by the Federal Gov ernment at the Webster School for Pregnant Girls in Washington expressed some criticism that might apply to other programs. A basic conflict exists, the study found, when the girls are taught to try to be good mothers and yet are also en encouraged to be absent from their children most of the day while attending school. The girls are taught to want, love and care for ba bies, the study said, but they are also encouraged to post pone having other children until they are finished with school or married. The study also said: “Rep etition of pregnancy among the girls was not reduced as a result of participation in the Webster program. Many girls had second babies within a relatively short pe riod of time.” The study not ed, at the same time, that the figure was substantially lower for girls who had grad uated from high school. Nevertheless, despite such criticism, many educators and participants agree that the programs offer pregnant teen‐agers opportunities for schooling that they might never have had. Mary Ellen attended a spe cial program for unwed moth ers in Chicago and won a scholarship to the University of Wisconsin. She said she was very grateful, but added thoughtfully: “The only hitch to that program is I had to be preg nant to get in.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A MASS PROTESTS EASE OF ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/12/28/archives/a-mass-protests-ease-of-abortion.html,"HANOVER, Mass., Dec. 27 (AP)—Archbishop Humberto S. Medeiros was joined today by five Boston priests in the con celebration of a special mass protesting the increased accept ance of abortion in the United States. The mass, in the auditorium of the Cardinal Cushing School, was celebrated on the eve of the feast of the Holy Innocents, a day in the calendar of the Roman Catholic Church on which are venerated an un numbered group of Jewish boys slain by order of King Herod at the time of Jesus’ birth. Archbishop Medeiros was the principal celebrant. He preached a homily titled “The Value of Human Life,” in which he said that various legislatures had revised “the traditional laws that have protected the life of the unborn.” He said that all the scientific advances of modem man “should serve life, not destroy it, Should protect the unborn, not eliminate them.” “The new barbarism is a summons to death,” he said, “the Christian faith is a call to life.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

REALIGNING URGED FOR HEALTH UNIT,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/12/29/archives/realigning-urged-for-health-unit-report-suggests-new-goals-for-city.html,"An advisory committee rec ommended yesterday to Mayor Lindsay that the city's Health Research Council be restruc tured to pay more attention to the health needs of the people and to sponsor community‐in volved research relevant to these problems. The committee was appointed by the Mayor in July to eval uate the work of the council, which was set up as a munici pal agency in 1958 to make the city a center of scientific research and health care. With a combination of city and state funds, the council has paid out $70‐million in grants for research on infant diseases and deaths, pulmonary and heart diseases, chronic dis eases of the aged, mental ill ness, alcoholism and narcotics addiction. However, the council's budg et—which was $8‐million at its inception—is now down to $5.2‐million and the council has seemed in danger of being phased out because of the city's financial queeze. Phasing out the council could seriously affect medical schools in the city, since much of the money received in grants by their faculty for research has come from this municipal agency. The advisory committee ex pressed the opinion that through the council the city had benefited from the research of more than 200 scientists, much of it on “problems that are characteristic of or made worse by the contemporary big‐city environment.” Resources Analyzed Analyzing the research re sources that had been spon sored by the council, the com mittee said they could provide “an opportunity and a poten tial for immediate action on some of the most acute prob lems afflicting the people of the city, especially its young and poor.” It listed among the problems drug addiction, venereal dis ease, alcoholism, respiratory dis eases spawned by the city's air pollution, and the need for safer abortions. The committee, composed of a national panel of adminis trators, scientists, businessmen and former public officials, said the city would lose a “unique asset” if the council was abolished. It recommended that the Mayor sponsor a new Health Resources Council, to be ap pointed by him. This council, it said, “should be competent to speak for the many constituencies — com munity health‐action groups, health workers, young physi cians in training, medical school faculties, hospital ad ministrators and others — who have a stake or a role in the health services.” “The council,” it declared, “should be charged with as sessing the health needs of the people and mobilizing the necessary resources for co ordinated research attack on chosen subjects.” A spokesman for the Mayor said last night that Mr. Lindsay was studying the report and would consider its recommendations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ROCKEFELLER LINKS TAX PLAN TO NIXON,https://www.nytimes.com/1970/12/30/archives/rockefeller-links-tax-plan-to-nixon-will-hold-off-a-rise-till-he.html,"ALBANY, Dec. 29—Governor Rockefeller has decided not to disclose his tax plans in his opening–day “state of the state” message to the 194th Legisla ture here next week, prefer ring to wait until President Nixon addresses the new Con gress next month. One high administration of ficial cautioned that the Gov ernor “certainly doesn't want to indicate that there won't be” proposed tax increases to meet a fiscal crisis next year, because “the prospects are not too bright, no matter how you slice it.” But sources close to the Governor said today that he did not want to make a final budget determination until he saw whether the President would seriously prod Congress into enacting a Federal reve nue–sharing program with the states. Since his re–election to a fourth term, Mr. Rockefeller, facing mandated increases in state spending of $1.3–billion, has lobbied incessantly for a Federal revenue–sharing pro gram. In the last two months he has urged Mayors, County Ex ecutives, educators, the state Congressional delegation, legis lators, Republican Governors and Mr. Nixon himself to seek enactment of a revenue–sharing program that would provide $10–billion more in aid to the states next year, with about $1–billion of that sum going to New York State. Ordinarily, Mr. Rockefeller is obliged to present in detail his proposed state budget during the third week of January. In the past he has usually said in his message to both houses of the Legislature on opening day whether he will seek tax in creases. For instance, on the opening day of the 1969 legislative ses sion, he called for a 5 per cent across‐the‐board cut in projected state spending and an increase to 3 per cent in the state sales tax. On opening day this year, he called for an election–year budget that could be financed without increasing state taxes. Since 1971 marks the begin ning of his fourth term, and technically the start of a new gubernatorial administration Mr. Rockefeller is permitted to withhold his detailed budget proposals until Feb. 1. “At this point he doesn't have to make a final decision,” one high administration offi cial said, “so he can wait and see what the chances are.” According to the official, “the toughest reality” facing the Governor as he works on three messages — his ??naugural message, to be de livered on New Year's Day in the State Capitol, his message to the Legislature, to be de livered Jan. 6, and his budget message—is the $1.3–billion in mandated increases for the 1971–72 fiscal year beginning April 1. These increases, already en acted into law, include salary increases for state employes, state revenue–sharing with localities, a variety of pension settlements and increases in school aid. Economy Steps Ordered The state's budget for 1970 71 was originally about $7.2 billion, but the Governor has ordered economy measures that are expected to place the fig ure at about $7–billion, because state revenue receipts thus far are not meeting the amounts anticipated when the budget was approved. In addition to the mandated increases, there have been, and will continue to be, demands for large increases in state aid from the Board of Regents, the state school boards and the Mayors of the state's six largest cities, among others. Using New York City as an example, one state official who requested anonymity noted that in the past the state had man aged to somehow “pull rabbits out of hats” to increase aid to the city but that “there aren't any more rabbits available.” “Does that mean there will be no new state programs in the coming year?” the official was asked. “I wouldn't say a complete lack, but far less than depart ment heads would like to see,” he replied. Another source said that Mr. Rockefeller's New Year's Day inaugural address, marking the onset of his 13th year in office, would be “philosophical” and “a little high–flown for a politi cian,” but that it would seek to discuss the possibility of revamping the structures of state and local government. Mr. Rockefeller's disposition towards other issues that are expected to come before the Legislature were reported as follows: ¶REAPPORTIONMENT. He is amenable to taking up Congres sional and legislative redis tricting at the regular legisla tive session, provided all the Federal Census data needed are available, but there is a possibility that the issue will be dealt with in the fall at special session. ¶ABORTION LAW. He is “open–minded” about modify ing the liberalized abortion law that passed last year. ¶No ‐ FAULT INSURANCE. The Governor will push for passage this year of a proposal to eliminate traditional “fault liability” automobile insurance, and so help end much of the courtroom litigation that now occurs in automobile damage suits. ¶UNIVERSAL HEALTH IN SURANCE. For the fourth con secutive year, he will ask for a program primarily financed by employer–employe contribu tions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

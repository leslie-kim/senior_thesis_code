"Reform Seeps Into India's Views On Caste, Family and Education",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/01/archives/reform-seeps-into-indias-views-on-caste-family-and-education-the.html,"LOTUN, India — Three high‐caste Hindus ambushed a young untouchable as he walked along a mud lane in this primitive village late one evening and beat him badly. because his wife had dared draw water from their well. The assault, the sort of thing that happens all over India all the time, was just one more statistic in the catalogue of repression that has kept the untouchables firmly imprisoned at the bottom of the Hindu social hierarchy for centuries. A few nights later, in a new kind of reaction that is happening more and more often, the untouchable got some friends together and retaliated, roaring through the high‐caste neighborhood of this village south of Bombay and setting fire to a number of huts. “We're fighting back for a change,” the untouchable explained proudly as he sat on a string cot and sipped sweet, milky tea from a chipped cup. “We're no longer going to take everything that those people care to inflict upon us.” The incident, reflecting new and growing militancy among untouchables, or harijans as they are often called now, is part of a social revolution that is changing many aspects of daily life. To be sure, the change often seems as slow and awkward as the bullock carts that amble all over this land. But Indians looking back over their three decades of independence from Britain say they see signs of a fundamentally new attitude toward social change — what a retired banker in New Delhi described as “a new sense that things can be changed, that we don't have to live forever by all the old rules.” Besides the suggestions of erosion in the caste system, here are some other aspects of what the modernists hope is new India: ¶ Women are enjoying a greater measure of freedom. Divorce and abortion have been made much easier, and the Government is moving against the dowry and child marriage. ¶ Education is penetrating much more deeply and the literacy rate is twice what it was at independence despite the huge population growth since. ¶ Hindus and Moslems, despite sporadic clashes, are living in greater harmony, and India has shown itself to be a genuinely secular state, disproving many of the fears expressed at the time of independence, when most Moslems chose to settle in Pakistan. Certainly the grip of tradition is still daily fact in the lives of most of the 640 million Indians, especially in the villages, but even there new social standards are sometimes being applied and there are sign's of new resistance to old attitudes. “It's now or never,” declared Defense Minister Jagjivan Ram, the most prominent untouchable, at a tumultuous convention of untouchables in the northern city of Chandigarh. “The question today is whether to live or die.” Calling on his fellow untouchables in blunt language to build upon their recent legal successes to achieve full equality, Mr. Ram told them that other Indians were gradually coming to realize that “we are in no way inferior to others since God has made every human being.” With a degree of tough solidarity that would have been unthinkable a decade or two ago, the convention adopted a resolution to work for a broad range of social reforms, including land redistribution and economic and social benefits for the minority of about 15 percent of the population. Sign of Division, Sign of Hope To some Indians the untouchables' increasing tendency to fight back against caste Hindus is a dangerous sign of social division. Others find in it hope that there might be some chipping away at the caste system, one of the most paralyzing features of Indian society. “Americans had to go through some dark and violent days before the black man there finally began to get his due,” said an angry young un- touchable who had taken part in marches in Bombay. “Maybe it will work now in India, too.” For 30 years India has had laws prohibiting untouchability, the practice of designating people untouchable from birth, restricting them to occupations viewed as unclean and denying them access to temples, wells and residential neighborhoods reserved for the higher castes. However, the practice has persisted in most rural areas. The law has been strengthened several timed over the years. The most recent legislation, enacted in 1976, provides jail sentences for discrimination against untouchables and forbids compelling “any person, on the ground of untouchability, to do any scavenging or sweeping or to remove any carcass or to flay animals or to do any other job of a similar nature.” Pessimists — who, on the subject of India, are not difficult to find — point out that such laws are widely ignored. Optimists reply: Yes, but at least they show that the country is trying and that its leaders are determined to make an effort to end ancient abuses. In the summer, when the state of Maharashtra decided to name one of its universities after B.R. Ambedkar, who was a framer of the Constitution and probably the most illustrious untouchable in India's history, the higher castes protested violently, and half a dozen people were killed in riots. The violence tended to obscure the fact that, finally, 20 years after Mr. Ambedkar's death, someone was trying to name something important after him and that if this effort failed another one would probably succeed before long. In a coordinated program to break down the ancient prejudices, the Government of Prime Minister Moraji R. Desai has started a vigorous program of what in the United States is called affirmative action, with specific quotas for untouchables in government, in Parliament and in university placement, and often with different admission standards. In certain schools in the state of Madhya Pradesh, 15 percent of the places are reserved for untouchables, who can qualify with test scores of 181 out of a possible 450, compared with the 261 points required of the general population. As in the United States, the programs have often been controversial. In a land- mark case in 1975, the Supreme Court upheld the southern state of Kerala, which was promoting untouchable civil servants without requiring them to take the same tests that their co‐workers take. “The concept of equality is that if persons were dissimilarly placed, they cannot be made equal by having the same treatment,” the court declared. ‘A Woman Is Made to Obey’ A similar standard is frequently applied to women, whose status the Government is also trying hard to advance through specific admission quotas in schools and through laws aimed at reversing the tradition of male superiority. An ancient Hindu precept decreed: “A woman is made to obey at every stage of her existence. As daughter it is to her father; as wife, to her husband; as widow, to her sons.” Though a good many men —and women — still feel that way, women are increasingly breaking out of their traditional roles, especially in the cities, so that they constitute 12 percent of the scientists and 8 percent of the doctors. “I am regarded as much less of a freak than I used to be.” said a middle‐aged lawyer in the northern state of Uttar Pra- desh as she hung up the starched white dickey and black frock coat that she and her male colleagues wear. “It used to be that when young girls asked me about entering the law I'd tell them they needed a great deal of courage. Now I say, All you need is brains, just like a man.” Women have traditonally been more active in politics here than in most countries. The current Parliament has 38 women — there are 17 in the American Congress — and Indira Gandhi was, of course, one of the few women elected head of a major government. It is outside the area of jobs that the position of the Indian woman is changing the most rapidly. Abortion on demand, which became legal in 1972, is increasing at a rate of more than 20 percent a year. Similarly, divorce, which was made easier in a federal law passed two years ago, is also steeply on the increase as women discover that if they are not happy in marriage, they can leave. Greater Awareness of Rights “Women are more and more aware of their rights,” explained Ansuya Dutt, a leading divorce lawyer, “and that leads to more marital breakups as the wife insists on greater freedom and the husband fights back.” Although the percentage of women who can read has tripled since independence, many are expected by their husbands and their in‐laws to “exist as property,” in the words of a recently divorced New Delhi woman. Rama Mehta, a well‐known sociologist, put it this way: “Indian society is going through dramatic and rapid changes. affecting radically the traditional role of women. The increasing number of women receiving higher education and using their training to establish their individual sphere of influence is something completely new in Indian society. Women are no longer equipped by their upbringing or education to view themselves as completely subordinate.” In a study Mrs. Mehta also related the increase in divorce to the decline in the traditional Hindu extended family —called in India a “joint family” — with several generations living together and all certain of their roles. “As the traditional respect for age and authority was on the decline, the line of authority and responsibility between men and women was no longer clearly delineated,” she said. Life Expectancy Sharply Higher One reason that some of the old extended‐family living patterns are breaking down grows out of a major advance in another area: a sharp increase in life expectancy. Thanks to better sanitation and medical care, Indians are living 20 years longer than a generation ago, which puts new strains on younger wage‐earners in the joint family. “You see, nobody ever expected us to live as long as we have,” said R.M. Sethe, a 74‐year‐old member of the Indian Association of Retired Persons, a club formed in a Bombay suburb four years ago. As his gray‐haired friends. nodding in agreement, sat in a circle in the brightly decorated game room, Mr. Settle continued: “You live with your son's family for years and at first your authority remains unchallenged. But then maybe it gets crowded in the flat, and then the young ones begin muttering about how much they are paying for you, and after a while you think, sadly, that maybe you'd be better off on your own.” In Bombay, India's most westernized city, a recent survey indicated that as many as 30 percent of the old people no longer lived with their children, a high figure in a society to which the extended family has traditionally been bedrock. Besides the increase in life expectancy, the developmental gain that probably affects the most people is in education, which has been a priority of the Government since independence. More than 80 percent of children of primary‐school age are in class, compared with 30 percent 30 years ago, and the literacy rate has gone from 16 percent to 30 percent. The number of universities has quadrupled in the same period, with institutions in virtually every important discipline, nurturing pride in technical competence and selfsufficiency."
Albany Session Is Due to Stress State Economy,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/01/archives/albany-session-is-due-to-stress-state-economy-new-legislature.html,"ALBANY, Dec. 31 — With the bitter election‐year battles behind it and no immediate fiscal crisis ahead, the 202d New York State Legislature will join Governor Carey here Wednesday to begin a session expected to center on the less flashy imperative of rebuilding the state's economy and making the government do more with less. To help pay for his debt‐ridden campaign, the Governor is holding a $125‐aperson ball here on Wednesday — the first inaugural ball in Albany since 1959 — and another in New York City on Jan. 13. He is expected to renew his push for public financing of state campaigns shortly thereafter. But when the parties are over, many of the same problems that have plagued the state's people and its government will remain, and many of the old partisan battles are expected to resume between the Republican‐led. Senate and the Democratic Governor and his allies who lead the Assembly. Economic development will continue to loom large among legislative concerns, and recent court decisions are expected to focus new attention on the real property tax laws and educational financing. In addition, now that the Legislature has settled its fight over barring “redlining,” or geographic discrimination in mortgage placement by banks, it must, under Federal law, face the same problem by insurers, which is expected to be no easier to solve. And a series of interviews with politicians and legislative aides indicated that the. longstanding emotional fights over the death penalty and public financing of abortions are certain to be revived — this time apparently with the Senate in a position to override a veto of the death penalty by the Governor but with the Assembly still lacking the necessary twothirds majority. And even before the new Legislature convenes, the Senate's Republican leadership has begun warring with Mr. Carey over some of his appointments. The Assembly will continue to be controlled by the Democrats, who retain an edge over the Republicans, 86 to 64, after a loss of four seats in the last election. The Republicans will continue to have solid majority in the Senate, 35 to 25. Among them will be an unusually large number of new faces in the ranks — 26 in the Assembly and 10 in the Senate. New Assembly Leadership The Assembly will be under new management after the defeat of two longtime leaders, the Speaker, Stanley Steingut, and the minority leader, Perry B. Duryea. Stanley Fink, Democrat of Brooklyn. appears to be uncontested in his quest to be Assembly Speaker, and he will have to find a replacement to fill his former post of majority leader. Daniel P. Walsh of up. state Franklinville and Alan G. Hevesi of Queens are viewed as the leading contenders for that post. James L. Emery, Republican of Geneseo; will be the new minority leader. Much of the legislative agenda will be determined by the tussle over how to spend the state's money, a fight that will not begin in earnest until Governor Carey presents his budget in early February. The following are some other matters the Legislature is expected to consider: ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT In an effort to spur the economy, Governor Carey has promised another tax cut to follow the $750 million reduction enacted last year, but he and the Republicans are already at odds over the size and shape of the cut. Mr. Carey talked during his re‐election campaign of reducing the corporate income tax from 10 percent to 9 percent, and more recently of a cut in the capital gains tax. But the Senate majority leader, Warren M. Anderson, Republican of Binghamton, said in a recent interview that he believed that a further personal income‐tax reducton would be more beneficial in encouraging business decision‐makers to locate and stay in New York, thus spurring the economy. The Republicans are also looking for a faster and deeper cut in the sales tax on beating fuel, in addition to the modest reduction that was reluctantly accepted by the Democrats last year. EDUCATION AND LOCAL AID Further adjustments are expected to be made in the new financing plan adopted last year in an effort to have the state comply with court decisions ordering more equitable education financing —but again, there are disagreements over how to adjust the complicated aid formulas. The state must also work toward a permanent solution of a financing crisis created in Rochester, Buffalo and several dozen school districts by a court decision barring them from levying taxes above the constitutional limits under any circumstances. The Legislature made loans and adopted stopgap measures last year, but a permanent solution remains elusive. CITY UNIVERSITY Faced with continuing problems in closing its budget gap and the threat of more aid cutbacks from the Federal Government, New York City is expected to turn once again to the state for additional financial help. The city is also seeking more state aid in paying for the operating and capital costs of City University, and to what extent it gets it remains to be seen. But the price the Legislature likely to exact from the city is a reduction in the number of city representatives on the Board of Higher Education, the university's governing body, which must be renewed in some form when it expires June 30. HOUSING The state's faltering Mitchell‐Lama program, subsidizing middle‐income housing, remains in need of changes that will return it to financial stability. The plans put forward lest year — which involved rent increases and state subsidies — were politically sticky and a solution remained elusive as the elections approached. With the election behind him, Mr. Carey is preparing another plan for the Legislature's consideration. Other proposals to improve the state's housing stock are also in the works. WELFARE With the new fraud‐prevention and cost‐cutting programs of recent years in place, some legislators are making tentative soundings on the possibility of raising the welfare grant level, which is currently based on the 1972 cost of living and was last increased in 1974. Governor Carey said he did not foresee an increase in the basic grant unless there was more Federal welfare aid. But a Democratic aide in the Assembly suggested there might be a move toward a “selective increase,” perhaps in the rent allowance. The Senate will have a new Social Services Committee chairman to replace William T. Smith, a conservative who each year proposed slashing the grant level. Mr. Smith has been named deputy majority leader, and a ranking Republican aide there said: “How long can we go on with the '72 figures? We're not Scrooges.” LABOR The Legislature will be forced, by the expiration of old laws and contracts, to face a number of difficult issues regarding public employees. The state's labor contracts with 200,000 of its workers expire this year, as do the laws permitting an “agency shop,” the temporary extension of the “heart bill” that allows policemen and firemen to retire with higher benefits if they develop heart trouble during their tenure, and binding arbitration provisions between the police and firemen and local governments outside New York City. The battle over reforming the state pension system will resume as the current system expires. A commission studying reforms in the system is scheduled to make its report. GAMBLING After much wrangling, the Legislature last year gave first approval to three versions of a constitutional amendment that would permit casino gambling in New York State. This year's Legislature must decide which — if any — of the proposals to put to the voters. The different amendments provide for varying mixtures of state and privately run casinos."
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/01/archives/letters-on-abandoning-democratic-taiwan-of-westway-ecology-and.html,"To the Editor: I am a graduate student who recently returned from 14 months’ study in Taiwan. I am very excited at the the United States’ decision to recognize Peking (it's about time we students of China had the opportunity to study there). Yet I am surprised at the omission, in all the discussions of portentous consequences to Taiwan, of any analysis in the press of President Chiang Ching‐kuo's decision to cancel the Dec. 22 provincial and national government elections in order to “avoid unrest.” This election would have been unique in the history of the Republic of China, promising increased liberalization and political diversity in a Government much too dominated by the ruling Kuomintang. To one familiar with the unusual backgrounds of many of this year's non‐party candidates, it is difficult not to see Chiang's decision as taking advantage of an unrelated issue to spare his Government some well‐deserved challenge on issues of human rights and freedom of the press. The Kuomintang (KMT) has long suppressed all political opposition, citing the need for “unity to fight the Communist bandits.” The essentials of its propaganda have changed little since 1949, as it continues to promise a swift “recovery of the mainland.” The result is that the Taiwan press is limited internationally to reporting evidence of the Communists’ impending downfall and internally to giving extravagant praise to the KMT. Taiwan is economically very stable and prosperous and in a good position to begin rectifying its untenable international situation. Under the current Government public discussion of the question warrants a life prison term. Rapid industrialization has also brought problems of social disruption and uneven distribution of wealth. Yet unions and strikes remain illegal, and there is no welfare system. Candidates such as Chen Ku‐ying, former National Taiwan University professor (fired for protesting Government policy during the Tiau‐yu‐tai incident in 1971); Huang Tien‐fu and Chen Wan‐chen, former reporters for the Taiwan Times (a widely read daily paper which the KMT purchased from its editors recently on condition that these and other reporters be fired); the very popular writers Wang Tuo and Yang Ching‐chu, whose stories are about current social issues and the conditions of workers in Taiwan (the former's books have been suppressed), and many others were committed to liberalizing the Government from within. Their campaign literature and public statements showed them to be committed to the democratic process and to orderly, nonviolent political change. They are hardly “Communist dupes and conspirators,” as intimated by the latest grossly distorted reports released in the international Chung Yang Jih Pao, Taiwan's official newspaper. Candidates such as these won resoundingly during last November's elections despite widespread evidence of KMT harassment and vote fraud. The number of independent candidates running in 1978 increased tenfold, and I think it is fair to say that the KMT would have faced its most serious political challenge since the 1950's, when opposition was put down with troops. It is extremely ironic that cries in the U.S. of abandoning “democratic Taiwan” in favor of “Communist China” should coincide with what all Taiwanese surely see as just the most recent example of the Kuomintang's thinly veiled maneuvers to maintain its dictatorial control. Of Westway, Ecology And Carey's ‘Shuffle’ To the Editor: No wonder Governor Carey is furious with E.P.A. Regional Administrator Eckardt Beck, who keeps raising questions about Westway. Given Mr. Carey's own prior statements about Westway — “a planning and ecological disaster” — Mr. Beck is probably making the Governor see ghosts. Besides, Mr. Beck is undermining the main contribution of the Carey administration: the shuffle. Danced to the tune of an old disco group, Big Money, the shuffle involves convoluted movements through which high officials end up with positions opposite to those held before they gained office. The Governor has successfully taught the shuffle to Mayor Koch and Transportation Secretary Brock Adams. That a lower‐echelon public servant refuses to practice the shuffle is so galling the Governor that he is now publicly calling Mr. Beck a “lunkhead” and apparently trying to get him removed from office. Well, Mr. Beck may be out of step with the Governor, but he is certainly not out of line with the law or with democratic principles. But if he is “lunkhead,” he should do well in New York; we always elect a few lunkheads to our highest offices. ‘Let's Get On With It’ To the Editor: Opponents of Westway either are imbued with self‐interest or live in the past. The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates there will be 30 million more vehicles on our roads in 10 years. More and more people travel by car and bus. More and more goods are distributed by truck. Vehicles —and they will increasingly become powered by less‐polluting fuels —must be accommodated. Holding back the building of a long‐range, traffic‐facilitating project like Westway is holding back the clock. It is a disservice to our region and to the vast majority of our residents. Good for Governor Carey in his push for Westway. Let's get on with it. The Insanity ‘Charade’ To the Editor: As shocking as the Officer Torsney case is, your thinly veiled racial explanation for it [editorial Dec.22] is misleading and incorrect. I have prosecuted numerous cases where defendant and victim were the same color; the results were tragically identical. The jury verdict is critically influenced if not solely determined by psychiatric testimony where “insanity” defenses are asserted. The real insanity lies in allowing this charade to continue. The gross unreliability of medical projections and evaluations of insanity and danger to the community have been amply documented, yet the deference to medical mumbo jumbo continues apace, in the name of science, which barely masquerades expedience. Would that the results were atypical; unfortunately they are not. Senior Trial Attorney Bronx Homicide Bureau Bronx, Dec. 22, 1978 To Choose a Chief Judge To the Editor: In commenting on the new, nonpolitical method of selecting the Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals [editorial Dec. 26] you lament the absence from the list given the Governor by the Judicial Nominations Commission of any candidate measuring up to” a Cardozo, Fuld or Breitel.” Each of these exemplars of judicial excellence was nominated and elected by the old, purely political system. What Peking Relations Will Do for the U.S. To the Editor: The substantial opposition to U.S. rapprochement with mainland China is surprising in view of the new relationship's overwhelming advantages. The U.S. will continue to maintain its trade relationship with Taipei. It is likely that it will permit the flow of military supplies to Taiwan since the island serves as a buffer zone in a strategic part of the world, defending both the mainland and American interests in the region. The U.S. fleet in the Formosa Strait can be deployed elsewhere, possibly in the Indian Ocean, where Soviet influence has been expanding. Besides, unofficial links to Taiwan will persist. Economic ties with Peking represent a brand‐new ball game. A vast, untapped market with enormous potential is being made available to the West. The oil potential of the mainland can help reduce Western dependence on the OPEC nations. Oil from Peking and from Mexico in the next decade can keep our economy afloat. The military significance of the new relationship must not be overlooked. It will help balance Western influence in the eastern perimeter of the globe. The ties will temper the Soviet thrust in the far Pacific region. Japan, our great ally in the Far East, will feel far less stress from the U.S.S.R. Members of Congress opposed to the new relationship with the People's Republic of China must accept the realities of a changed situation. Realpolitik inexorably destroys the slender fabric of idealism — perhaps unfortu nately. ‘Superfluous’ Presidential Action on Alaska To the Editor: In your editorial concerning protection of Alaska lands, you state this premise: “. . . a similar bill died in the Senate when Alaska's Senator Gravel refused to let it reach the floor. The impasse posed the danger of a destructive land rush. A special interim protection for the best national lands provided by a 1971 law will lapse on Dec. 18.” It is convenient for those who favor President Carter's land withdrawals to postulate this “deadline” after which a “land rush” could begin. But in fact no such land rush is possible under Federal law which was in place before President Carter acted. Some of the land which the President withdrew has indeed been protected since 1972 under Section 17(d)(2) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, and that section did indeed expire on Dec. 18. But on that date, all of this land reverted to equal protection under the previous clause of the same act, Section 17(d)(1). The President's action was superfluous. In addition, I feel he overstepped the intent of the law that he relied upon in making the withdrawals. This is the Antiquities Act of 1906, which is intended to protect “historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest” by withdrawing land “confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected.” The natural wonders of Alaska should indeed be protected and preserved. But the emergency suggested in The Times's editorial simply does not exist, and the President's action was inappropriate. MIKE GRAVEL U.S. Senator from Alaska Washington, Dec. 22, 1978 E.R.A.: The Doubts and the Fears To the Editor: We of Women's Branch, Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, take issue with Eleanor Schwartz's letter of Dec. 20, in which she castigates Rabbi Sol Roth for expressing concern that despite the guarantees of the First Amendment the Equal Rights Amendment may interfere with and hamper religious procedures and practices of the Orthodox community. Orthodoxy does not countenance coeducational advanced schools of Torah studies, nor does it approve of women serving in the rabbinate or officiating as cantors, or mixed seating at religious services. There are no guarantees in the E.R.A. that the above practices may not be challenged in the courts as violation of that amendment. We are also deeply troubled that, should the draft be reinstated, under the E.R.A. women would be drafted into the armed forces and Orthodox young girls would thus be exposed to a life style antithetical to their religious and moral convictions. To those who have abandoned Orthodox practices and traditions such possibilities conjure up no fears or apprehensions, but to women who are loyal and committed to historic, traditional Judaism these matters are of deep concern. There are presently at least three Federal laws designed to protect women's rights in employment: the Equal Pay Act of 1963, Executive Order 1246 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Why, then, give the Supreme Court an opportunity to carry the Equal Rights Amendment to the same limits of absurdity as the laws regarding apprehension of criminals and the death penalty? Once an amendment like the E.R.A. is law, the matter is no longer in the hands of the people; the courts become its sole interpreters. Who are those still seeking to foist the E.R.A. upon the American populace after having failed to succeed in the seven years originally allowed for passage? By and large they are the same individuals who have made a holy crusade of gay rights and who are responsible for making tax‐paid abortions a national disgrace. To accuse those who express legitimate doubts and fears about the E.R.A. — doubts and fears shared by millions of Americans — is bigoted and unjust. DEBORAH TURK National President, Women's Branch Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America New York, Dec. 23, 1978"
Book Censorship Increasing in Schools,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/02/archives/book-censorship-increasing-in-schools-teachers-dispute-board-no.html,"ANAHEIM, Calif., Jan. 1 (AP) When school opened this year, Nancy Mitchell packed away dozens of books accumulated over the years as supplemental reading for her literature students. The paperbacks, which had been used in her 10th‐grade and 11th‐grade courses for nearly 10 years, were suddenly banned. They were not on the list of 270 books deemed appropriate for English classes in the Anaheim Unified School District. Anaheim is one of a growing number of communities to ban books from classrooms. More incidents of removing or censoring books occurred in the United States in the past school year than at any other time in at least 25 years, according to Judith F. Krug, director of the American Library Association's Office for Intellectual Freedom. Among the books involved in 300 reported incidents of censorship were The American Heritage Dictionary too many objectionable words — J.D. Salinger's “The Catcher in the Rye,” Richard Wright's “Black Boy” and the works of Richard Brautigan, including his well‐known “Trout Fishing in America.” Teachers Dispute Board In most communities, banning stems from parental complaints to school boards. But in Anaheim, it grew out of a teacher‐designed program to return to the basics of grammar. The teachers say they were merely providing examples of appropriate books, not creating a “restricted” list. The limitations were imposed later by the board, they contend. “They are trying to delete all controversial books from the list,” said Dave Barnes, former chairman of the district's English department. “If they did that overtly, it would be very obvious and would draw a lot more criticism. By going in the back door, it makes them look more legitimate.” Mrs. Mitchell said, “Most of the teachers who participated in the revision of the curriculum did not realize those books not on the new lists would not be available for supplemental reading.” But James Bonnell, president of the Anaheim Board of Education, said the teachers apparently misunderstood. ‘No Need for Further Books’ “The only effort to restrict comes from the content of basic grammar classes,” he said. “If they teach grammar properly, they will have no need for further books. Nor will they have time for them.” Jo Ann Barnett, a board member who believes a majority of the board specifically meant to limit reading material, noted that two members also sat on the board that openly tried to ban about 15 books from the district in 1971. That effort was dropped under community pressure. Around the country, some books have been banned because they contain obscene language or references to drugs or premarital sex. In other cases, the authors themselves have come under fire, sometimes for being homosexuals, sometimes for being Communists. “What they did in Anaheim is a little broader than is common,” said Dorothy Massie of the National Education Association. “But it's not at all uncommon for school boards to bow to community pressure to take some books out of the library or make modifications in the program. “Some of it is tied now to the belief students are not learning to read and write,” she said. “People say we're putting new materials in school about the black experience, or books by Kurt Vonnegut, for example and they also point to declining test scores. They say one is causing the other.” Norma Gabler of Longview, Tex., recognized nationally as one of the chief advocates of book banning, criticized what she considers a move away from wholesome books once assigned as school reading. “The whole philosophy of education has changed,” she said. “The aim is no longer to teach fact, skills and knowledge. The aim is to change the thinking and values of children.” Advocacy of New Ideas An example of the kind of protest raised by Mrs. Gabler occurred last summer in the South when textbook critics challenged a book that portrayed women in careers outside the home. Their attitude was that most women in this country are in the home — where they should be — and if they are to be protrayed accurately, that is where they should be shown. Mrs. Gabler believes the schools are experiencing a change of teaching technique in which new ideas are not only presented but also advocated. “The aim is to change the social values of the child and any time you do that, you're going to step on people's toes,” she said. Some teachers readily concede that subject matter has changed. “Sure, we're dealing with some pretty adult matters in school,” said Anaheim's Mrs. Mitchell, a 51-year-old mother of five. “But then, I can't remember anyone in my high school class having an abortion.” “It is difficult to decide what things to use in the classroom,” said Mr. Barnes, who left his Anaheim teaching job because of what he saw as the board's repeated suppression of teachers’ rights. “Do you deal with premarital sex? And how do you handle it so as not to glorify it? That's part of the problem of being a teacher.” But many parents and board of education members consider it their problem, too. “It's all a matter of what you're .going to fill the time with,” said Mrs. Gabler. “Parents are spending more money on education than ever before and they have less to show for it. Whenever you choose materials’ with offensive language and no academic value, I think parents have a right to complain.”"
"Death Rate Falls To 9.6a 1,000, A Record in City",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/02/archives/death-rate-falls-to-96-a-1000-a-record-in-city-shift-in-population.html,"New York City's death rate fell to 9.6 deaths per 1,000 population in 1978, a record low, the city's Health Department reported yesterday. The number of deaths — 72,800 — was the lowest in the city in 50 years. “Older persons seem to be moving out of the city and younger persons seem to be moving in,” Dr. Reinaldo A. Ferrer, Health Commissioner, remarked in explaining part of the decline. But he added that “medical advances and better delivery of health services are also responsible” for “a decreasing death rate at the same time that our resources are strained by the fiscal crisis.” The department reported that the city's birth rate had resumed a decline after a one‐year increase, with 14 births per 1,000 population, down from 14.5 in 1977 as against an average of 20.2 during the 1960's. Last year's 106,700 births represented a numerical low since the Depression years of the 1930's. Births to Teen‐Agers Rise Births to teen‐agers were 14.1 percent of the total, or 15,048, the rate up slightly from 14 percent in 1977. Abortions increased from 86,676 in 1977 to 90,600, rise of 4.5 percent. There were 75,011 deaths in 1977, for a revised death rate of 9.9 per 1,000 population, compared with 77,538 and a rate of 10.2 in 1976; 76,312 and 10 in 1975, and 88,161 and 11.2 in 1970. The death rate was as high as 15 in annual averages from 1910 to 1919. Eighteen women died in childbirth in 1978, a rate of 1.8 per 10,000 live births, down from 24 deaths and a rate of 2.2 in 1977. In the 1920's, the city's maternal mortality rate averaged 52.3. “Advances in prenatal care and obstetric care and care of the newborn are the keys,” Dr. Melvin S. Schwartz, assistant commissioner for biostatistics, said, “but without the role of overseer and monitor which the Health Department plays, such advances could not be translated so quickly into the favorable maternal and infant mortality rates which we see.” Heart diseases remained the leading cause of death, but were down to 396.4 per 100,000 population, compared with an average of 476 in the 1960's. Total deaths from the 10 leading causes were: Heart, 30,187; malignant neoplasm (cancer), 16,238; cerebrovascular disease, 4,085; influenza and pneumonia, 3,096; cirrhosis of the liver, 2,072; accidents, 1,565; diabetes mellitus, 1,538;. homicides, 1,526; perinatal mortality, 970, and suicides, 780."
STUDENTS ARE ASKED VIEWS ON ABORTION; Study of Admission Policies Finds 40% of U.S. Medical Schools Put Query to Applicants,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/04/archives/students-are-asked-views-on-abortion-study-of-admission-policies.html,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 3 (AP) — Forty percent of the nation's medical schools question prospective students about their views on abortion, but a survey sponsored by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare found that only one school acknowledged that those views could be a factor in the admissions process. Also, 1 percent of the nation's nursing schools said that they inquired about an applicant's views on abortion. The survey was ordered by legislation sponsored by Senator Richard S. Schweiker, Republican of Pennsylvania, who is a critic of abortion. In 1977 he charged that students who opposed abortions were being discriminated against by medical schools. 1,000 Answer Questions Nearly 1,000 of the nation's 1,371 nursing and medical schools responded to the survey. Only six said that an applicant's views on abortion had any effect on admissions. Four were nursing schools apparently attached to religious hospitals that had policies opposing abortions. One medical school reported the “quality” of an applicant's views as weighed by interviewers could affect admission. And an osteopathic school said that theoretically there might be “an adverse effect” if a student was rigidly opposed to abortion or sterilization. The 26‐page report, which was prepared by System Sciences Inc. of Bethesda, Md., cautioned that the survey had been conducted quickly, no effort had been made to verify what the schools reported and the results did not show how much discrimination existed. ‘Tip of the Iceberg’ Mr. Schweiker said that he thought the report showed “only the tip of the iceberg.” He said that he would press for legislation to bar medical and nursing schools from discriminating against students because of their views on abortion. Of the six schools that said an applicant's views had an effect on admissions, the report said, “it appears that the nature of the discrimination is generally rejection of pro‐abortion applicants at nursing schools and rejection of anti‐abortion applicants at medical and osteopathic schools.” The schools were not named. All but four of the 126 medical schools in the United States responded to the survey. Of those, 40 percent said that they questioned prospective students about abortion, but only “to examine the applicant's grasp of topical issues and ability to express an idea logically.” “The schools report they are interested in the abilities related to formulating and expressing an opinion, rather than the opinion itself.- the report said. Other topics treated in the same way included euthanasia, socialized medicine and physician fees, it added. Some Rule Out Question Twenty medical schools said that they had admissions policies on abortion. Half prohibited rejecting a student because of his personal views and the other half ruled out asking the students about it. Only four nursing schools said that views favoring abortion could affect admissions decisions. Eight schools said that they had policies that prohibited abortions. One nursing school said that would reject a woman who had had an abortion or a pregnancy outside marriage. The report also said that one hospital “clearly” discriminated against doctors opposed to abortion who competed for residency in obstetrics‐gynecology."
"Assemblyman Walsh, an Upstater, Is Named Majority Leader by Fink",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/05/archives/assemblyman-walsh-an-upstater-is-named-majority-leader-by-fink-new.html,"ALBANY, Jan. 9 — Assemblyman Daniel B. Walsh of Franklinville was appointed majority leader of the New York State Assembly today in a move that legislators saw as an effort to broaden the appeal of the Democratic Party upstate. The appointment, made by the new Speaker of the Assembly, Stanley Fink of Brooklyn, places an upstate Democrat in a key Assembly policy‐making role for the first time in many years. Mr. Fink, who assumed his new office yesterday, also announced changes in the chairmanship positions of several pivotal Assembly committees. Contrary to earlier reports that Assemblyman Leonard P. Stavisky would be removed as chairman of the Education Committee, the Queens legislator was reappointed to the post by Mr. Fink. An aide to the Speaker acknowledged that Mr. Stavisky had been reappointed despite expressions of dissatisfaction with his performance by other committee members. New Banking Committee Chairman An expected change that was mane was the removal of Assemblyman George W. Miller as Banking Committee chairman. The post went to Assemblyman Herman Farrell, who, like Mr. Miller, is from Manhattan. Mr. Fink, who named Mr. Miller his majority whip, said the change had nothing to do with reports that Mr. Miller's wife owed $193,000 on a housing rehabilitation loan in Harlem. In another change, Melvin H. Miller of Brooklyn replaced Richard N. Gottfried of Manhattan as chairman of the powerful Codes Committee. Mr. Gottfried was given the post of assistant majority leader, the job Mr. Walsh held last year. At a news conference tonight, Mr. Fink said geography was a “factor, but not a determing factor,” in his selection of Mr. Walsh. End of ‘Absurd Argument’ Mr. Walsh, who is from the western part of the state, said his appointment would “put the nail in the coffin” of the “absurd argument that the state has geographic divisions politically,” with upstate being Republican and downstate being Democratic. The Republican majority in the State Senate also announced its new committee chairmen today, including the appointment of Richard E. Schermerhorn, a con- servative from. Cornwall-on-Hudson, as chairman of the Social Services Committee. In an interview, the 43-year-old Mr. Walsh said he intended to be “an extension of the Speaker” in his new job, which involves helping to shape Democratic policy and leading the fight for the passage of Democratic‐sponsored bills in the Assembly. Like Being ‘Cub Scout Leader’ The on-the-floor aspect of the job, Mr. Walsh said, is largely technical: lining up votes and managing the debate. Off the floor, he said, it involves acting “much like a Cub Scout leader, trying to keep everybody happy and solving problems.” The new majority leader acknowledged that he has had differences with Mr. Fink and a majority of Assembly Democrats on two major emotional issues — abortion and the death penalty. Mr. Walsh has opposed Medicaid financing for abortions and has supported the death penalty. He said he expected to maintain those positions in future votes. “Those things are beyond political boundaries — they are ideological differences,” he said. Mr. Walsh was described yesterday by associates in the Legislature as an amiable and hard‐working Assemblyman who had made few enemies in his six years in office. Some associates speculated that Mr. Fink had chosen him as majority leader because his quiet, easygoing manner would not outshine that of the new Speaker. ‘You Don't Want a No. 1’ Mr. Walsh, told of this theory today, said: “When you are making a choice for a No. 2, you don't want someone who will be a No. 1.” The new majority leader represents a large, sparsely populated district that includes Cattaraugus County and parts of Chautauqua and Erie Counties. Mr. Walsh, by profession a teacher, coached basketball and taught social studies before entering politics. Mr. Walsh served in the Cattaraugus County Legislature before being elected to a traditionally Republican seat in the Assembly in 1972. Mr. Walsh lives in a restored 150-yearold house in Franklinville with his wife, the former Nancy Cashimere; their two daughters, Courtney, 19, and Meghan, 9, and the family's Irish setter, Brigid."
Liberal Group Criticizes President and Congress,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/05/archives/liberal-group-criticizes-president-and-congress.html,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 4 (AP) — The liberal Americans for Democratic Action gave failing grades today to President Carter and Congress for “one of the worst session: of Congress in recent history.” Leon Shull, national director of the lobbying group, said the 95th Congress was bad for women, minorities, the middle class and the national interest. “Both the President and Congress overall must receive failing grades,” he said. In its annual evaluation, the group gave five Representatives perfect scores for adopting the same position as the A.D.A. on 20 issues. They are Representatives Sidney R.

"John Paul's Winning Ways; Public Seems Pleased by Liveliness of New Pope, But His Impact on the Large Issues Is Still Unclear; News Analysis",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/06/archives/john-pauls-winning-ways-public-seems-pleased-by-liveliness-of-new.html,"ROME, Jan. 5 — Outwardly John Paul H, the first non‐Italian Pope in 455 years, has revolutionized the papacy in the three months since his election. He has become the most highly visible pope in modern history, sallying forth! from the remoteness of tne Vatican every few days and charming the crowds from schoolchildren to old people and from nuns to soccer players. His impact on the Roman Catholic hierarchy, on theological doctrine and on the global politica‐and religious problems facing the church is more difficult to define. He has gone out of his way to placate the traditionalists in the church by taking conservative positions in statement after statement on such issues as celibacy for priests, abortion, the unbreakable nature of marriage and the need for priests and nuns to wear the clerical habit at all times. Name of Virgin Mary Invoices In his first address, on the day of his election, he demonstrated his theological conservatism by twice invoking the Virgin Mary. Liberal Catholic theologians have lately sought to de‐emphasize Mary's significance in deference to Protestant beliefs. He received the defiant traditionalist French prelate, Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, and there are hints - not officially confirmed- that the two may have reached agreement on a reconciliation under which the church would lift its twoyear‐old suspension of the rebel in exchange for his promise of moderation. Some Vatican specialists believe that the new Pope has adopted a strategy of pre‐empting opposition from the conservative forces to gain greater leeway later with social and political issues on which he does not share their view. A Bow to ‘Progressive Dissent’ Yet the Pope also went out of his way to receive one of the leaders of “progressive dissent” - Msgr. Sergio Mendez Arceo, Archbishop of Cuernavaca, Mexico. The Pope will soon find himself in the middle of a confrontation between conservatives and progressives in Puebla, Mexico, when he attends a conference of Latin American bishops there. Conservative prelates of the region want to revise a progressive policy statement adopted last month calling on the church to side with the poor and persecuted against dictatorial regimes. If Pope John Paul was less determined to assert his personal leadership, he could have stayed out of that confrontation by declining to go to such a meeting so early in his pontificate. That was the course that his predecessor, John Paul I, chose. Policy on Communists Not Clear On the vital issue of the Vatican's relations with the Communist governments of Eastern. Europe, the ‘Pope has made no major moye yet. Being Polish and coming to the Holy See straight from a post as second‐ranking figure in the embattled Polish church, his every gesture is being watched Carefully for the impact it might have in Eastern Europe. His utterances make it clear that he regards the Polish church, with its strong nationalist tradition, its militancy and discipline, as model to be followed elsewhere. The Pope's decision to move around and seek the public limelight, stems, according to Vatican specialists, from his conviction that a bit of charismatic leadership can restore to Catholicism some of the youthfulness and joyfulness that the church has lost under previous papacies. He plays to different crowds with the skills of the former actor that he is. He has kissed babies and has accepted skis as a gift during a visit to a community sports club. He has received the national soccer team of Spain. He took the unprecedented step of answering reporters’ questions. Mobbed by Thousands of Nuns When he gave an audience to several thousand of Rome's 18,000 nuns, they mobbed him in an emotional scene of cheering, shoving and pressing forward to touch him. When calm returned he told them: “I thought that sisters were serious. Instead they make a lot of noise and are so energetic they seem to want to destroy the Pope or, at least, his cassock.” Almost every Sunday he has left the Vatican to visit churches and Catholic gathering places in Rome. Some of his predecessors made one such trip a year, some never. The sorties have caused monumental traffic jams that lasted for hours and spread from his route to virtually the entire city. The Italians, and especially the Romans, are delighted with the public, performance of the new Pope. As the first non‐Italian in centuries, he was keen on I conquering the hearts of the Catholics ofl Rome who are his on-the-spot constituency —""the studio audience,” as a Vatican prelate termed them jokingly. Handline the Vatican Bureaucracy John Paul II has been tough‐minded in his handling of the Curia, the Vatican administration,. The cardinals who direct the Curia are appointed for periods of five years but their term ends automatically with the advent of a pope. John Paul I declared immediately after his election that he wanted all the members to serve out their terms. Not so John Paul II. He waited several weeks before he confirmed Jean Cardinal Villot, Secretary of State and second‐ranking prelate of the church, in his post, and even then he did so only for “an initial period.” The same restrictive phrase is reported to have been included in letters to the other cardinals of the Curia, but, unlike the one to Cardinal Villot, those have not been made public. Officials here have drawn the conclusion that the Pope is determined to exert strong personal leadership on all the major issues facing the church and that in due time he will surround himself with new and mostly younger men to carry out his policies.

Pope Draws Wide Political Fire On Abortion and Divorce Views,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/06/archives/pope-draws-wide-political-fire-on-abortion-and-divorce-views-fear.html,"ROME, Jan. 5 - Pope John Paul II has made himself the focal point of a political controversy between Italy's major parties as a result of his statements against abortion and divorce. A Socialist member of Parliament, Loris Fortuna, has accused the Pope, a Pole, of “open intrustion” in internal Italian affairs. In addition, L'Unittl the Com munist Party paper, and Avanti I , the Socialist Party paper, criticized the Pope this week for placing himself in opposition to the law. The leader of the Radical Party, Marco Pannella, urged Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti to defer the signing of the new Concordat between Italy and the Vatican even though agreement on its terms has been reached after nearly 10 years of negotiations. And the Republican Party said it might call a national referendum to show that most of the people approve of the law, passed last May, that makes abortion legal in Italy. Fear of Losing Referendum It was fear of losing such a referendum that originally prompted the governing Christian Democrats, who have strong ties to the church, to accept the law after long negotiations with the Communists and other parties. The Christian Demo- crats need the support of the other parties for their minority Government.. The law was a compromise, stronger than the Christian Democrats had wanted but weaker than the other parties wanted. It permits state‐subsidized abor- tion on demand in the first 90 days of pregnancy for any woman over 18 who says that childbirth would endanger her physical or mental health. A medical cer- tificate is required after more than 90 days, and women under 18 must have the approval of a parent or guardian. The Pope's latest statement on the sub- ject came in a New Year's Eve address. He declared that the church had not only the right but also the obligation to defend “the principle of absolute mutual fidelity until death” in marriage and “respect for new life from the moment of its concep- tion.” No Evidence of Any Benefits His prepared text said that “it could not be conceded that the principle of divorce and the principle of abortion served the well‐being of man, made his life more worthy or served the creation of a better society.” But in his delivery, the Pope spoke of “programs that facilitate the betrayal of marital faith and the destruction of life conceived in the womb,” avoiding the words “divorce” and “abortion.” A few days earlier, the Pope condemned the abortion law in a speech to doctors. As permitted under the law, many doctors have registered as conscientous objectors to avoid having to perform abortions. But the medical profession has generally gone along with the law and abortions are being performed in state hospitals at a rate that pro‐abortion organizations call satisfactory. Politicians and commentators in parties other than the Christian Democrat took issue with the Pope not so much for speaking out against abortion and divorce as for saying the church had an obligation to oppose the two. They argue that since both are now legal, the church Is infringing on the independence of the state by obstructing the law."
UPSTART IN THE SENATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/07/archives/upstart-in-the-senate-after-a-short-flamboyant-time-in-congress-pat.html,"After a short, flamboyant time in Congress, Pat Moynihan is a controversial apostle of the new conservatism and prime booster of New York. WASHINGTON. A half a dozen environmentalists troop into Pat Moynihan's inner office, array themselves in a semicircle around his elegant antique desk and beein to tell New York's Democratic Senator why pending legislation to preserve Alaska's undeveloped land is of compelling importance. Moynihan listens as attentively as he can, tapping a green felt‐tip pen against his desk. “Quite frankly, it's not something think about,” he breaks in brusquely, switching to New York's problems of “acid rains” (industrial emissions that are transformed into sulfuric acid and pollute waters) and the deterioration of Central Park. “I have been preoccupied with Central Park,” he announces majestically. “It is the greatest piece of urban design we have.” The group, worried that the point of its visit has been missed, tries to steer him back to Alaska. “I've been to Alaska,” he says. “I know what Alaska is like. I've been just about everywhere.” He deftly maneuvers the delegation to the door, exhorting it to “stay in touch. My main interest is New York. If there are things in New York on your mind, let me know.” The heavy oak door hisses closed behind the visitors just as Moynihan's frustrations burst out. “Did you hear what she said?” he asks rhetorically, his expressive voice enhanced with measure of indignation drawn from his ample reserve. “This is the first time the New York chapter of Americans for Democratic Action has sent someone down here and it's to worry about Alaskan lands.” He rises to his full height, an imperious feet 4 inches, and runs a hand through his disobedient shaggy gray hair. “The South Bronx is burning and all they're worried about are caribous in Alaska.” In two years as a United States Senator, Daniel Patrick Moynihan has become New York's biggest booster, New Yorker's New Yorker who eats, Steven Rattner is a reporter in the Washineton bureau of The Times. sleeps and breathes New York. He even roots for its professional sports teams, a substantial concession for a man who attends sporting events only under duress. His flamboyant energy, provocative ideas and dexterous intellect are now at work diverting Federal dollars to New York, not only to ease the visible fiscal crisis, but also to bail out the Delaware and Hudson Railway, save the Social Security center in Jamaica, Queens, build a new Federal courthouse on Long Island, give Buffalo a mass transit system and clean up the chemical pollution in Niagara Falls’ Love Canal. His longstanding interest in social policy, and particularly in urbanism, meshes nicely with New York's urban focus. When, from time to time, he continues to dabble in foreign policy — mostly to warn of the Russian menace — he is indulged and even respected. Moynihan's “New York First” philosophy is typical of a new parochialism that has struck Congress in the last few years, since the problems of the industrial states and the disparity in economic growth rates between Sun Belt and Snow Belt states first received wide public notice. That discovery convinced Northerners — once content to allow rural states to receive a disproportionate share of Federal spending—of the importance of Washington's dollars to local prosperity. The result has been increased friction over the division of Federal outlays and a heightening of regional tensions, at least within the Capitol. Helping to arouse regional consciousness — for instance, through his ongoing battle with the Carter Administration over whether New York gets its fair share — has been one of Moynihan's principal achievements. Taken together, his accomplishments are impressive for a freshman Senator. Although his blunt style has earned him more than his share of enemies, he has mostly played the Senate game well, picking his issues carefully to avoid the bruising battles at senior levels over more controversial questions like defense spending or energy. Instead, he has chosen to become the Senate's resident expert on a handful of issues, including welfare reform, tuition tax credits and revenue sharing, all key to New York. On those issues he can be tenacious. Moynihan now qualifies as a leader of the neoconservative movement which stands for a strong foreign policy and a social policy based on the welfare state, but conditioned by a critical realism. In part, his domestic shift has been aided by the national conservative trend. Industrial growth, technological progress and a decentralization of choice are cornerstones of the Moynihan ideology. “At heart, we're New Deal, Fair Deal, John Kennedy types who stand for a liberal, social‐justice type of society and have taken a strong position on defense and foreign policy,” said Senator Henry M. Jackson, a Washington Democrat who is close to Moynihan, although more liberal. “There's been change in position for both of us and we'd like to think our approach is pragmatic one.” Moynihan is mentioned often these days as a future Presidential candidate. His position as a leading apostle of neoconservative philosophy frequently brings him into ideological conflict with another Presidential contender, Senator Edward M. Kennedy. “We've been enormously disappointed with Moynihan,” said a top Kennedy aide. “We had hoped that Moynihan would be more of an ally on issues like tax reform and welfare.” In any role, the 51-year-old Moynihan will never suffer from a low profile or from lack of critics. His outspoken style — strong, sometimes excessively strong, opinions delivered vigorously, sometimes too vigorously — produces equally strong reactions. It is not so much what he has accomplished in the Senate that is criticized as the way he has gone about accomplishing it. In Moynihan's mind, ends have triumphed over means. The criticism is not so much of Moynihan in comparison with colleagues of similar junior status (by that standard his achievements are almost universally considered substantial), but of Moynihan in comparison with what might be expected of one of the Senate's most impressive minds. That mind can draw heavily on the lessons of history and offer observations on the role of xenophobia in the construction of the Washington Monument or the fact that the first atomic bomb took 39 months to build, a demonstration that “there are no insoluble technological problems.” Furthermore that mind can generalize brilliantly, as in seeking to abstract from the specifics of the New York experience generalities that try to explain the decline of mature societies. Not surprisingly, Moynihan's moods are deep and far‐ranging. But their outward manifestation is a sometimes erratic performance. In many ways, his actions are conditioned by the tension between his poor, Irish‐Catholic origins and the Harvard‐New York-Washington experiences of his maturity. He is trapped between the intellectual and the pragmatic, between the grave demands of his present duties and his darkly Irish barroom past. It is, in fact, a tension mirrored by his staff, by his life style and by his ideas. Almost invariably, at the end of meal, Moynihan will dip two outstretched fingers into his water glass, run them across his puckish lips, then dab at his mouth with his napkin. “That's an old habit of the English aristocracy that he's picked up,” one associate explained. “The poor Irish have always looked to the English upper class as their model.” For Moynihan, the route to the aristocracy was a long one. It began on St. Patrick's Day Eve, 1927, in Tulsa, Okla., where — before moving to New York — his father worked as a newspaperman. An Indiana‐born, first-generation Irishman and a classically harddrinking reporter, he walked out on Pat's mother, a practical nurse, when their son was 6 years old. Mrs. Moynihan tried to support the family by running a saloon on 42d Street near Times Square, even then a rough, honky‐tonk neighborhood. Pat spent his childhood hawking newspapers, tending bar at Moynihan's, the new family enterprise, and shining shoes, including one stint on the southeast corner of 43d Street and Broadway, where the Toffenetti restaurant then stood He graduated in 1943 from Benjamin Franklin High School in Harlem, worked for a while as a longshoreman; then took and passed the City College entrance exam. “I swaggered into the test room with my longshoreman's loading hook sticking out of my back pocket,” he told one interviewer. “I wasn't going to be mistaken for any sissy college kid.” That toughness is still with him. Ultimately, he collected four degrees from Tufts University and also spent a year at the London School of Economics on a Fulbright scholarship. Moynihan's ruggedly individualistic rise to the top seems to have left him with a Calvinistic view of how today's poor should be helped. In part, he has become disenchanted with the direction of the movement to help the poor, particularly the black poor. His energetic involvement in welfare reform notwithstanding, however, his efforts are increasingly being expended on the working poor: families whose adult members are trying hard but just can't make a go of it. Indeed there is a noticeable lack of compassion in Moynihan's welfare rhetoric. His talks about totalitarianism are more passionate than those about poverty. In recent years, he has come to enjoy elegant dress and elegant bars; his aspirations to the gentry may be showing. Moynihan's high living includes as well a prowess for after‐hours socializing. That aspect of his personality combines with his eccentric mannerisms to lead to suggestions by both critics and supporters that he drinks during the day—enough to affect his performance. Moynihan denies it and there is absolutely no evidence that his pleasures  In 1955, Moynihan met another IrishCatholic — feisty, wonderfully independent Elizabeth Brennan — who became his wife. Liz, who prefers the family farm at Pinders Corners in the Finger Lakes region of New York, endures Washington and their frame house in a racially mixed section ofCaipol Hill,There, Moynihan enjoys Diono Walker  Tim Moynihan, 22, drew the affectionate brown-paper-bag caricature of his father sitting by the fire, attired in an aristocrat-at-leisure costume, sipping a cognac, feet resting on rugs Liz found‐in Afghanistan. The Moynihan children are: John, 18, at Wesleyan University; Maura, 21, now in Paris, during her year off from Radcliffe; and Timothy, 22, an artist, living in New York. During the 1976 Senatorial campaign, Moynihan was viewed as something of an interloper in New York. After all, he had spent most of the previous decade and a half in Washington and Cambridge, Mass., where he taught urban studies and government at Harvard. So he enjoys being able to trace his New York political lineage back to 1953, when he worked on Robert Wagner's first campaign for Mayor. “I've been around longer than anyone else in New York Democratic politics,” he says. “1 wrote speeches during Robert Wagner's first term and visited Averell Harriman in Washington when it was a major expedition for which you practically had to get a passport and vaccinations.” In 1961, Moynihan began his Federal service and his well‐publicized activities during those years provided much of the notoriety that propelled him into the Senate. As a 34-year-old whiz kid, he was asked by President Kennedy to design the nation's first antipoverty program. His Kennedy service is perhaps best known for one remark. “I don't think there's any point in being Irish if you don't know that the world is going to break your heart eventually,” Moynihan said shortly after the assassination. “We will laugh again, but we will never be young again.” During the Johnson Administration, Moynihan's Kennedy efforts became the landmark Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, which set up the war on poverty. In the course of it, Moynihan not only aired the sensitive issue of lower I.Q. scores posted by black children, but also ascribed it to broken and fatherless black homes. Later, during his Nixon years as a counselor, he suggested a period of “benign neglect” on the question of race, a statement that unleashed a firestorm of criticism. Moynihan has spent much of the past eight years reminding people that he did not say that blacks should be subjected to a period of benign neglect—only that the issue should he so treated. Yet even today, he is distrusted by blacks and other minorities, as demonstrated by the vote in the Senatorial primary. Perhaps sensing Nixon's coming fall from grace, Moynihan left the White House in 1971, made a show of being excited about returning to academe and promptly reappeared on the Federal payroll in 1973 us Ambassador to India. In 1975, under a new President, he became permanent representative to the United Nations. That proved Moynihan's most visible plat form from which to preach his hard‐line rhetoric. Ile won enthusiastic audiences. Polls showed overwhelming approval of his tough attitude; and that rhetoric, designed for Republican Administration in 1975, now appeals to Democratic audiences in 1977. “We will not be rolled back any further,” Moynihan told a liberal audience — to applause — in Nyack, N.Y. recently. “There will be no more retreat.” When Moynihan finally decided to run for the Senate from New York after insisting that he wouldn't and then offering unconvincing explanations for his switch — the primary campaign became a referendum on neoconservatism versus 1960's liberalism. Moynihan, the darling of the Commentary set and the sometime apostle of revisionist social policies, bested a traditional Democratic liberal. Bella Abzug, amid bitterness and recriminations which Moynihan willingly fed. Even today, the public attitude toward him mostly reflects his earlier careers.  The campaign itself proved anticli -mactic as Moynihan — positioned deli. cately at the center and self‐right. eously indignant at incumbent James Buckley's record on behalf of New York — swept into office a half‐million votes ahead of his Presidential ticket mate. “The biggest of our problems in the period ahead is that nobody is confidently — much less, passionately bringing new ideas to government,” Moynihan said during the period between his election and his ascension. “I'm part of a movement to assert the needs of the Northeast with respect to the national economy, which is a new idea.” Senate tradition dictates that freshmen Senators should be seen frequently, heard on occasion and listened to only rarely. So, like the class genius trying to ingratiate himself as one of the boys, Moynihan arrived in the Senate wearing as much humility as he could muster. The customary deference to the Senate leadership was proffered and in return came a choice assignment, the Finance Committee. As Moynihan enjoys noting at least five times a day, that made him the first New Yorker in 60 years and the first New York Democrat in 100 years to serve on the committee “where the money is.” For his second major spot, he chose the Environment and Public Works Committee, another large dispenser of local patronage.  Moymiban appears to be respected by his colleagues; although they, like others, are sometimes put off by his style. “He's a delightful rascal,” said Senator Lloyd Bentsen, a Democrat of Texas, who is on the opposite side of the Sun Belt‐Snow Belt debates. “I have differed with him on a number of occasions, but he is an extremely effective Senator for New York.”  Moynihan is also liked reasonablity well by Jacub Javits, the state's Republican senior Senator, who says: “We've gotten along very well. My voting record and my advocacies are more identified with Senator Moynihan's views than they were with Senator Buckley's.” Nevertheless, Javits is sensitive to the vast amounts of tavora. ble publicity Moynihan's Senate activities have received. (For its part, Moynihan's supporters take a somewhat derisive view of Juvits. Ili has given up his ranking position on the Human Resources Committee for a similar position, of less use to New York, on the Foreign Relations Committee. “lie's been it) Israel more than he's been upstate,” said one observer. Moynihan becomes Inuibled when his intellectualism and his politics are in conflict, as they often are. At such times, his good sense takes him one way and his instincts take him the other. One day last fall, a delegation of women visited to insure his support for an approaching key vote on the equalrights innendment. Moynihan was reassuring, for his supporters ate heavily in favor of the amendment. But after the delegation left, he began to question his position. Actually, he and his staff have grave misgivings about the E.R.A., based on their interpretation of the law. His intellectual guilt (sizing, Moynihan complained to an aide, “Isn't there any residuum of selfrespect around here? Not much in my case, I know, but we're dealing with constitutional procedures.” When the vote comes, Moynihan votes with the women; but an aide painstakingly notes that the issue will ultimately be settled in the courts. Recognizing, as most freshmen Senators must, the instability of his present employment, Moynihan has already formed a 1982 re‐election fund which allows him to stump around the state on behalf of local candidates. the party and, ultimately, himself. By nature gregarious and extremely likable, Moynihan — undoubtedly the most popular Democrat in New York — enjoys these appearances in small doses, but the novelty quickly wears thin, particularly when the dosage is three packed weekends a month. One day he marvels about how well Mary Anne Krupsak has taken her defeat in the New York primary. “I guess not cut out for this,” he says quietly. “That toughness you have to have. I just don't have it.” The inclination toward dilettantism and grandstanding can combine to produce the appearance of a man against himself. It is sometimes as Moynihan knows what he has to do, but comes close to hating himself for doing it. That conflict permeates even Moynihan's remarkable Senate staff, which is heavily weighted towards the young, intellectual and politically naive. The super‐bright administrative assistant, Elliott Abrams, was introduced by Norman Podhoretz, the editor of Commentary, a conservative journal. In the cramped staff offices, a lack of political savvy reveals itself from time to time. For instance, one legislative assistant persuaded the Senator to denounce the assignment of teachers by race in New York City as comparable to II itler's Nuremberg Laws and “a prescription fur division and hostility.” Two weeks later, the Senator felt ohliged to issiue clarification. Moynihan runs his (Mice much like Ilarvard tutorial — Socratic, unpredictable and intellectually demanding. The hard‐working staff members publish articles and also help with those articles Moynihan publishes each year Ile also continues to write books, partly because his $67,:)011 ov and tight limit lilt Outside fees have lett him in financial bind. The staff's shoot-front-the-hip, stinctive reaction I ellects Moynihan himself, who, despite his profundity of knowledge, sometimes may tint know quite as much as he thinks he does. It was a minor incident, but a telling one: Moynihan, visiting a vast Georgetown house, pronounced one oil painting on the wall a “Monet from the Chartres series.” The Monet series, however, was of the cathedral at Rouen. At other times, statistics he cites with great precision turn out to be not so precisely accurate. With Mayor Koch and Suffolk County's John Klein, Moynihan discourses on welfare. Port of Moynihan's instinctive style involves speaking publicly first and privately later, a practice which has contributed much to his cool relations with the White House. But the fact is that he loves the attention from press and public that accompanies a vigorous public denunciation. Last fall, when he was battling the White House over whether New York receives its fair share of Federal aid, Moynihan received a letter from President Carter which included a handwritten postscript inviting a further response. Moynihan's response added up to two press releases over the following 10 days and, according to the White House, a note to the President later in the month. For its part, the Administration isn't overwhelmed by Moynihan or by his self-assurance, which it sees as excessively holy self‐righteousness. He is too intricate, too innerdirected and hx) removed for their taste. “On balance, he's a plus,” said one very high Administration official. “But he's not done it the right way. He has had a problem getting his act together. He goes off in this direction and that direction. He's not one of those people who move or who will ever move the Senate very much the type who works hard in committee to grind it out, a Russell Long type, an Abe Ribicoff type — who get the work of the Senate done.” (Moynihan has also occasionally irked his colleagues, as when he termed an amendment proposed by an absent Senator, Malcolm Wallop, “inane, devoid of intellectual competence, or even rhetorical merit.” “Are we to reduce the United States Senate to a playground, a playpen of juvenilia, to the fantasies of prepubescent youth?” Moynihan asked. The next day, he apologized.) Progress in the United States Senate occurs incrementally; the landmark pieces of legislation are dwarTed in number and even in impact by routine, almost daily measures. For every Civil Rights Act or Panama Canal Treaty, the Senate approves a hundred minor bills or amendments which can shift many of the burdens and benefit; of the Federal Government from state to state. A small change in a publicworks formula — whether, for example, to include the area's unemployment rate — can mean millions of dollars more or less to New York. Moynihan recognized this phenomenon at the outset, and the battle over the public‐works formula, in which he beat Bentsen of Texas and others, brought New York $135 million extra. That pattern has been repeated in case after case energy‐tax exemptions, bridge repairs, transit grants, environmental regulations and so on On selected larger issues as well, Moynihan has performed commendably. Perhaps most dramatically, he almost rammed through Congress a first‐ever tax credit for private‐school tuition. The concept had been kicking around for years. as a means of aiding troubled private and parochial schools and colleges, but never came close to becoming a reality until taken over by Moynihan. The legislation ultimately failed to emerge, but not for lack of Moynihan's efforts. That experience with tuition tax credits involved a rare unveiling of Moynihan's Catholicism. a factor he normally tends to play down. He prefers to wage the tuition-tax-credit battle by relying on his decentralization rhetoric: “The liberals define anyone who is nut a statist as illiberal.” But he has also said that the tuition tax credit was the victim of anti‐Catholicism, “the one form of bigotry which liberalism curiously seems still to tolerate.” (Moynihan is aware of the support for the proposal in New York — and the potential political gain for him. During a recent visit to Elizabeth Solon College, a parochial school in Yonkers, he asked the audience to “pray” that the President would drop his Opposition.) Moynihan is less eager to grapple with the conflicts that his Catholicism holds for him on another issue involving religion — abortion. When pressed, he will say that he is for “freedom of choice” but that he finds abortion “personally repugnant.” If the quasi‐religious issues hold conflicts for Moynihan, so do most questions involving New York. Although a neoconservative, he is aware that big Government is still popular among his constituents when it means more money for the Empire State. “What's good for New York is good for the country,” he says glibly, when pressed about the contradiction. However, his record is clear — welfare, revenue sharing and the like are good if New York stands to get a disproportionate share. During the closing days of the last Congress, Moynihan at one point voted for a series of conservative, probusiness tax provisions and even co‐sponsored an amendment to cut the tax rate for business. A little later, he switched gears and rose to denounce a conservative, anti-big-Government, tax‐cut amendment. (His voting record meanwhile is mixed: 58 (out of 100) according to People & Taxes, a publicinterest group, which ranks him below Javits. and 70 accordint, to the A.D.A.. which listed him below Henry Jackson.) On issues of concern to New York his record is clear. Moynihan spent countless hours in the summer and fall pressing for an extension beyond 1978 of countercyclical fiscal assistance — a form of revenue sharing for beleaguered cities. The bill was virtually dead in the House when Moynihan, pushing against the grain of tradition, persuaded the Senate to consider it favorably. Although that legislation died in its final hours in the House (in part because of resentment over Moynihan's unorthodox strategy), another effort in which Moynihan was central —loan guarantees and related legislation for New York City was wholly successful. He has hammered away as well on welfare reform; and he has ultimately emerged without direct grants to local governments, but with a substantial increase in the earned-income tax credit which now aids onethird of all families in the country, many of them in New York. Regarding welfare, as other New York issues, Moynihan's efforts are driven by a rare candor about the gravity of the New York economic situation. “I've got this bankrupt city and declining state,” he explains. “We're just at the top of the business cycle and we'll go down in no time at all. We know how much we have let the cost of government in New York get out of line with the rest of the country. But the balance of payments between the state and the Federal economy is just wrong. We've got to learn in the Northeast to he quick on questions about the impact of changes in Federal expenditures.” Wherever he goes, Moynihan is almost always asked about his Presidential ambitions. In some ways, this is inevitable, for a Senator of his stature and talents automatically becomes a prospective Presidential contender. But more important, the Moynihan- for‐President talk sterns from a conscious effort by those who share the Ile000OS011iiii IVO halilli`f to put forward the most effective spokesman for their position. Moynihan himself has firmly and repeatedly disavowed any such goals and his denials are convincing. Indeed, Moynihan might find a Presidential race not to his liking — there would be fewer convivial evenings over drinks, no quiet IllOrThings at home to write an article, no naps in the Marble Room of f the Senate floor. Moreover, the broader electorate might riot find him so attractive — toil intellectual, too New York, OKI VCmoved. Moynihan seems to SCOW all this arid concentrates I ill his Senatorial duties. Late one night, he is standing favorite tweed hat and all — at the hat in the Madison Pub, a below‐stairs New York saltion. One patron tells hint, “You look much better in person than you do on television.” Then comas the inevitable question: “Are you going to run for President')” “Now,” responds Moynihan with finality, turning back to his beer. Ile softens and decides to explain. “It's true that the Senate is no longer a place where you don't speak fin two years; Senate traditions are breaking down and the average age of Senators is dropping each year. But it is still place that reveres longevity. ‘I he things I do are incremental. I can do lot of good if I stay there a long time and keep at it. And that's just what I'm of a mind to do.”"
Carter Aide on Women's Issues Is Stressing Economic Problems,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/07/archives/carter-aide-on-womens-issues-is-stressing-economic-problems.html,"WASHINGTON, (UPI) — In her job as White House adviser on women's issues, Sarah Weddington has been as. signed the arduous role of peacemaker to the warring factions that have polarized viewpoints among women. The path she has chosen is an economic emphasis on issues that involve all women — married or single, white or black, young or old, urban or rural. Among the pocketbook issues she plans to tackle are Social Security and pension reform, tax law inequities, credit questions, divorce settlements and veterans’ preference, which eliminates most women from equal competition with men for Federal lobs. While she still plans to deal with such emotional issues as abortion and the proposed equal rights admendment, Mrs. Weddington, a 33-year-old lawyer and former member of the Texas Legislature who succeeded Margaret Costanza as President Carter's assistant for public liaison, prefers a behind-the-scenes approach on controversial topics. “I personally will continue to be involved in E. R.A. and we will continue to work on all the issues of the International Women Year,” she said. Mrs. Weddington is the attorney who successfully argued before the Supreme Court in 1973 on the case that established ‘women's abortion rights. But she echoes Mr. Carter's more conservative stance, 'saying: “The Administration is really trying to push contraceptive availability and research. I will be involved in the President's commitment to provide alternatives.” As chairman of an intergovernmental task force involving 15 Federal agencies, Mrs. Weddington plans to work in tandem with the Women's Congressional Caucus, which has also targeted economic issues as a nrioritv. To illustrate the differences in Social Security benefits for men and women, she pointed to a family in which a man earns $12,000 compared with a married couple in which each partner earns $6,000. Under current laws, she said, “women will receive 61 percent greater benefits from the single worker family than from the dual worker family.” Another area of inequity she sees is unequal pay, despite recent legislation. “It's still true that men earn, on the average, 60 percent more than women,” Mrs. Weddington said. Pension reform is still another thorny question. Mrs. Weddington said she first became interested in this issue in the eight years she worked as a divorce lawyer in Texas. “Those in the retirement group are generally men, whose wives have not worked long enough to establish their own benefits,” she said. “In almost every private pension plan it is optional at the time you retire to choose survivor's benefits, and if you do, the pension will be less. This has an economic impact on the wife.” In divorce settlements, Mrs. Weddington said judges should view the husband's pension and Social Security benefits as form of community property, especially in cases involving nonworking wives. Credit problems continue, despite legal changes, Mrs. Weddington noted. As young lawyer putting her husband through school, she was required to get his signature on her credit application. Through her efforts, Texas finally changed its laws. Mrs. Weddington, who was one of five women among the 250 students in her law class, recalls that some professors refused to call on women in class. And, after graduation, some firms refused to hire women. “Society ought not to have preconceived models for people to fit into, but rather, it should give individuals a choice to exercise for their own lives,” she said. After three months at the White House, Mrs. Weddington said, she tries to remains a realist, unaffected by the aura of power. She also said she missed trial work but loved her current job. “I never planned to go to law school,” she said, adding that she earned a teaching degree but, realizing that she did not want to teach, went to graduate school instead. “I didn't plan to run for office,” she continued, “and decided three days before the filing deadline to run.” She won two terms. “I never thought I would come to Washington and then Agriculture Under Secretary John White called,” Mrs. Weddington said, and she became general counsel at the Department of Agriculture. Mr. White is now the Dernocratric national chairman. “I never planned to come to the White House and then Rosalyn Carter called,” she said. Her next step? That dep,smis on the saying a Texas professor passed on to her: “Where you are tomorrow depends on who you meet today.”"
Anderson Says He'sThe One,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/07/archives/anderson-says-hes-the-one-but-carey-demurs.html,"ALBANY— Warren M. Anderson is now the number one Republican in Albany, and don't you forget it. That was the message Mr. Anderson, the senate majority leader, seemed to be delivering, with considerable relish, last week. At one point, from his post on the Senate floor, he zeroed in on Governor Carey. Mr. Carey, Mr. Anderson claimed, had attempted an end‐run around the Senate's “advise and consent” prerogatives by slipping through 68 appointments during the 60‐hour gap between the 201st and 202d Legislatures. After good‐humored remarks questioning the process rather than the quality of most of the appointments, Mr. Anderson's voice took on a harder edge and, denouncing what he termed an attempt to “violate the Constitution,” he led his colleagues in rejecting the whole lot of “alleged recess nominations.” In the end, Mr. Anderson's polemics and maneuvering may not really matter. The legalities of the Senate's action are doubtful, and Mr. Carey insists it was “a meaningless exercise.” But the incident may have provided a preview of what many politicians expect to be a more combative Warren Anderson, one who will be less cautious about picking fights with Hugh Carey and possibly of great significance to the Carey administration— less likely to help him out of a legislative squeeze. The last few years have, in many ways, been disappointing for the 63-year-old Senator from Binghamton, who has led the Senate's Republicans since 1973. After the Democrats reclaimed the Governor's office and the Assembly majority in 1974, he was left as the only Republican in a position to make or break legiSlation, but he still wasn't his party's top figure in the Legislature. Somehow the aura of once-andfuture leadership remained with Perry B. Duryea, the minority leader of the Assembly. Despite Mr. Anderson's best efforts, Mr. DUryea parlayed that aura into the nomination for Governor that Mr. Anderson also coveted. The Senator is unabashed in saying that he thinks he could have beaten Mr. Carey in the general election. But Mr. Anderson also concedes that there was no way he could have overcome Mr. Duryea in a primary. Any satisfaction that might have been gained from watching Mr. Duryea's departure from Albany had to have been diminished by the success of a young Republican who has a perpetual smile and who already acts like a gubernatorial prospect. That new face belongs to Comptroller Edward V. Regan, who so far has nothing but praise for Mr. Anderson, at least in public. At any rate, it is obvious that Mr. Anderson does not plan to be a disinterested observer when his party next selects its gubernatorial candidate, and some insist that he still harbors hopes of running in 1982, although by then his age could be a factor. For now, he plans to raise his profile in the Senate, taking a more active role in its proceedings. He's also attempting to make himself better known generally; even his press releases are now more sharply honed. (Mr. Anderson got plenty of mileage recently, for example, when he was said to have said about Mr. Carey's recess appointments, “I can only assume that either the Governor is trying to hide some unsavory turkeys in an otherwise healthy flock, or he is following the perverse advice of people who know they are not going to be part of the second Carey administration, which will suffer the consequences.') Mr. Anderson has never been shy about using his power. All legislation must of course pass through his House, which has a 10‐vote Republican majority. On innumerable occasions in the past, Democrats have had to fashion their programs to his liking before he would support them. Last year's tax program, for example, in the end looked like a moderate Republican's view of what a tax reduction should be. The New York City convention center, a pet project of the Senate Minority Leader, Manfred Ohrenstein, didn't clear the Senate until it suited Mr. Anderson. But Mr. Anderson's reputation is not that of a legislative innovator, in part, because the “Republican Action Prdgram” is usually a reaction to the Democratic initiatives. This is also the case because Mr. Anderson is reflecting the will of his Republican conference, which is generally more conservative than he is. As a result, in floor battles on some issues, such as government‐financing of abortions — he is one of only a few Republicans to favor continued Medicaid funding — he has been temporarily separated from his fellow Republicans. The Senator is already drawing the lines for a battle over Mr. Carey's budget and where any new tax cuts, which both he and Mr. Carey agree should take place, should be targeted. Mr. Carey has been pledging to cut the business tax or the capital gains tax or some combination of the two; Mr. Anderson is looking for an additional reduction in the sales tax on energy and on the top brackets of the personal income tax, asserting that “I don't think we're as far out of step” in the business tax. Mr. Carey is said to have a good deal of respect for Senator Anderson, remembering that during New York City's fiscal crises, the Majority Leader somehow found the seven or eight votes that, with those of the Democrats, always passed the bills necessary to rescue the city. But the Governor and his aides are known to be frustrated by some of Mr. Anderson's parliamentary contortions, such as technically recessing the Senate to forestall Mr. Oarey's “recess” appointments. And without Mr. Anderson's competition with Mr. Duryea, which often found Mr. Anderson allied with the Governor and the Democrats against the Assembly Minority Leader, the legislative equation may be even more complicated. The new Assembly minority leader, James L. Emery, has expressed an interest in working with Mr. Anderson on a joint plan to regain Republican primacy. “I don't think it's going to be that much different,” Mr. Anderson said, although he added: “The Assembly Republicans will be part of what we do. We will always try to speak with one voice.” Richard J. Meislin is chief of the Albany bureau of The New York Times."

A POWERFUL current, only dimly perceived abroad, is surging throughout Soviet political life. It may be described, somewhat inadequately, as an intensely felt Russian nationalism, as distinct from Marxist internationalism and from the self‐identity of the scores of other nationalities that make up the Soviet federation. A force with enormous implications for the future, Russophilism is probably the most potent ideological factor in Soviet politics today, of far greater appeal to ordinary citizens than Western democratic values. It influences government officials and dissidents alike, and thereby confounds many Western notions about the nature of the Soviet system and its opponents. Russian nationalism is not new in Soviet history. Only five years after the revolution, Lenin was warning bitterly.ougainst a resurgence of “great Russian chauvinism.” By the 1930's, the nationalist underpinnings of Stalin's “socialism in one country” were the ascent. And in the 1940's, due partly to the great Soviet victory over Germany, a crude and strident nationalism became dominant in official Soviet ideology. So it remained until Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev revived early Leninist themes as part of his de-Stalinization campaign. Since the mid‐1960's, with the end of Khrushchev and de‐Stalinization, Russian nationalism has reemerged as a more pervasive and complex phenomenon. Not one but several, often antagonistic nationalist trends now compete in official and in dissident circles. Some accept uncritically the entire Soviet experience from 1917 to the present‐day state. Some reject everything Soviet, usually in favor of Russian Orthodox religion. Others embrace both the church and the Soviet state, but not Communism — or Lenin but not Stephen F. Cohen is director of the Russian studies program at Princeton and author of “Buklia rin and the Bolshevik Revolution: A Political Biography, l8881938.” Marx, Stalin but not Lenin. Still others manage such dizzying amalgams as the “idea of Moscow as the Third Rome, as the new Jerusalem, as the embodiment of the Leninist highest Truth and justice on ea rth. Underlying all these nationalist trends is an obsession with the special historical virtues of Russianness and, with few exceptions, contempt for things non‐Russian, including other Soviet nationalities and Western civilization. Even in its most outwardly “Soviet” expression, the new nationalism is plainly Russian, as a current ditty about the cosmonaut (and ethnic Russian) Yuri gaga riti is meant to illustrate. How good it is that our Gaga rin Is not a .Jew and not a Taturin [Tartar] Not a Bashkir and not an Uzbek. But our own Soviet chelovek [person] . The sources of contemporary Russian nationalism are both traditional and modern, which helps to explain its appeal to different segments of the populalion. On the one hand. there has developed within the intelligentsia a modern‐day replica of Inth‐century Slavophilistn, with its characteristic ideas about Russia's cultural apartness and special political destiny. And this has been accompanied by popular nostalgia, partly spirit- ??al and partly faddish, for features (real and irriagitied)”OC:.; prerevolutionary Russia,from the icon and czarist monoments to the virtues of rural life . On the other hand. today's tiunalism is Russian triumphs andy tragedies since 1917. The trumphs, notably in World War ll, have created an Intense national pride, even among dissidents. The tragedies, especially of the peasantry, have given rise to deep concern about the material, spiritual and demographic losses of the Russian people. In this respect. Russian nationalism is also a response to the growing national assertiveness of other Soviet Cl Int groups and to a dramatic demo graphic trend. Declining both rates among Russians and other Slays, and high birth rates Elmong the Turkic peoples of Soviet Asia especially, could soon reduce Russians to minority status in the U.S.S.R. Ethnically conscious Russians now speak privately, with alarm, of the “yellowing” of the Soviet Union, an anxiety exacerbated by the widely perceived menace in China. The once‐shadowy political agendas of Russian nationalism have now become an integral part of continuing disputes in all policy areas of Soviet life. Some evidence, though not much, supports the view that nationalist sentiments will be a beneficial factor in Soviet politics. AlIllorhough none of the nationalist trends, dissident or official, can confidently be called democratic in the Western sense, one trend, inspired by more benevolent and ecumenical strands of Russian Orthodoxy and focusing on real social problems, does set itself against the deeprooted illiberalism in Soviet officialdom and Russbin society. A remarkable example is Father Dmitrii Dudko, the son of poor peasants and a veteran of the war and Stalin's Gulag, who has achieved a saintly reputation among believers and nonbelievers alike. In 1973‐74, until banished from his small “Moscow parish, Father Dudko abandoned the traditional sermon for frank “discussions” about everyday concerns of his parishioners. Addressing the painful dilemmas of Soviet believers, as well as more general problems of cynicism, drunkenness, divorce and abortion, Father Dudko's uncompromising candor, simple Christian preachments and ethical nationalism attracted a sizable following. (Eleven of these interesting “discussions,” which also provide a rare look at popular attitudes, are collected in Father Dmitrii Dudko's “Our Hope” (St. Vladimir's Seminary Press, Crestwood, N.Y.) Unfortunately, the most conspicuous, politically muscular and apparently popular brand of Russian nationalism is far cruder — and ominous. Since the mid‐1960's, resurgent nationalist sentiments have mainly strengthened the most conservative and authoritarian elements in Soviet political life. Reviving some of the worst themes of Stalinism, these elements have found in nationalism a potent idiom and large constituency. Still worse, there has emerged, again both in official and dissident circles, a neofascist trend, complete with racist cults and truculent xenophobia (“Europe is an incorrigible harlot, and America is its final, Insane, nocturnal Bacchanalia”). Among its modest proposals are a “merciless rooting out of traitors, criminals, fornicators, smart alecks, and feckless people,” corporal punishment, anti‐Jewish pogroms and the “militarization of youth from primary school on.” Right‐wing extremism, though obscured by the victory of the left in 1917, is as Russian as vodka. As John J. Stephan, professor of history at the University of Hawaii, shows in “The Russian Fascists,” it lived on among some of the two million Russians driven from the country by the revolution and civil war. Between 1925 and 1945, about 10,000 emigres enrolled in an openly fascist movement to overthrow Soviet Communism and establish a Russian fascist state. As benifits his subjects, Professor Stephan's well‐written book is both a serious analysis and entertainment. It treats two centers of Russian fascism, one real, the other mostly chimeri- cal. The serious center was in Manchuria, where an aspiring Fiihrer, Konstantin Rodzaevsky, fashioned a small but vigorous Russian Fascist Party with roots in the large émigré settlement in Harbin and, after 1931, ties to the Japanese authorities. Rodzaevsky's party eventually became an instrument of the Japanese, and collapsed with their defeat, but it was an authentic, if repellent, political movement worthy of Professor Stephan's scholarly examination. The comical center was near Putnam, Conn., where another self‐styled Führer, Anastase Vonsiatsky, played out a bizarre rendition of only-in-America. A once‐destitute émigré in Paris, Vonsiatsky married the American heiress Marion Buckingham Ream in 1921. In the 1930's, her Connecticut estate became the headquarters, dubbed the Nineteenth Hole, of the squireFiihrer's All‐Russian Fascist Organization. something called the Russian Fascist Bible School in Harlem, Vonsiatsky's organization was a fiction of his tireless imagination. Professor Stephan properly forgoes much analysis of Vonsiatsky's politics and instead amuses us with lively anecdotal accounts of his flamboyant antics, which included showing up at black‐tie affairs in Nazi regalia, whistling the Horst Wess,1 marching song on the golf course- and commanding a pond‐bound navy of 700 toy battleships purchased at Woolworth's. Unlike Rodzaevsky, who was lured to Moscow in 1945 and executed, Vonsiatsky's ruin was a result of his own capacity for self‐promotion and notoriety. If in the 1930's his empty boasts of a worldwide network of agents - including saboteurs and assassins inside the Soviet Union - stirred only Stalinist paranoia, in the 1940's they brought him up against America's wartime fear of spies and the ambitions of a future United States Senator. Vonsiatsky was prosecuted in 1942 by Thomas J. Dodd (then a young Justice Department lawyer) and convicted of espionage. After three years in prison, he retired from active politics, appropriately to St. Petersburg (Fla.), where he died in 1965, American ‐style, ofa heart attack.

Unlike more nar. rowly focused collections, the book almost fully represents the broad spectrum of uncensored ideas from left to right. Of its 24 essays, most are substantial intellectual or political documents, and several will stand as landmarks in the development of Soviet political thought. The volume includes some authors already well known for their democratic views — Roy Medvedev, Pyotr Grigorenko, Valery Chalidze, Andrei Sakharov and Lev Kopelev. But Americans who equate all Soviet dissent with Western values should read the extreme nationalists, who are also represented. The moderate nationalists are here too, but they seem a center that cannot hold against the right‐wing tide. The “heralds of maniacal greatRussian chauvinism,” in Lev Kopelev's despairing words, find Russia's corruption in all things “foreign” — Jews, intellectuals, Western goods, liberal reforms and, yes, detente. They indict today's Soviet regime not for its authoritarianism, but for its false ideology and lost zealotry. They seek solutions and fulfillment of “Russia's mission” in a new despotism. Its exact form hardly seems to matter. “Back! Only back!” can mean, after all, hack to czarist autocStalinism. Is this extreme nationalism fringe eccentricity or, as Wk. hail Agursky insists in the samizdat anthology, the “tip 11i a huge neo‐Nazi iceberg, swimming unhindered in the Soviet Union's waters?'’ this is du subject of Alexander Yanov'!, very important hook “The Russian Now Right.” An ????????

His thesis, simplified considerably here, is as follows: There is a “repetitive effect” in the recurrent struggle between the authoritarian state and its opponents in Russian history. Like their 19th‐century predecessors the Slavophiles, today's nationalist dissidents begin as implacable foes of the regime. But their contempt for Western democratic traditions leads them, through successive schools of thought, first to an alternative concept of benevolent authoritarianism and finally to despotic programs that support the right wing of the Establishment and the existing state. Their evolution from liberal to fascist inclinations is a logical function of their obsession with “Russian idea.” Mr. Yanov traces this “repetitive effect” from revolutionary, liberal nationalists of the mid. 1960's, through Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's “enlightened authoritarianism,” to today's extremist trend typified by Gennady Shimanov. Despite his on persecution, Mr. Shimanov castigates civil‐rights activists for their “mutiny” against “our state” and dreams of a reborn ideocratic despotism based on a collaboration of Orthodoxy and the Soviet state. This logical progressio explains, for Mr. Yanov, the paradox of those Soviet dissidents who hate dissent and whose politics increasingly resemble those of the Establishment rightwing, especially in the I< .G.B., the Army and the Young Communist League. Thus the real function of the new extreme nationalism is to shape a “coalition of all factions of the New Right” in order to replace IN current Soviet leadership. An ticipating future crises and de dining popular support to Communist ideology, right wing nationalism is creatin,• “an ideological base for the pir. stble transfrirmatiori of the gume ... and the restoration I.

He warns against the nonsense, •tow rampant in American polltics, that all Soviet dissent is adnirable. He wants an American foreign policy that is attentive to democratic dissidents, but One that also supports reform forces inside the Soviet Establishment who are trying to resist the New Right “upstairs.” And, perhaps most important, he helps us to understand the possibility of a Soviet Government worse than that of Leonid I Brezhney."
ABOUT NEW JERSEY,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/07/archives/new-jersey-weekly-about-new-jersey-getting-away-from-the-city-isnt.html,"PEOPLE move from the city to the suburbs for various reasons. Some want a bit of land and the space of a house, some even like mowing lawns and some want more trees around them than there are in a city block. Some move to the suburbs simply to ‘get away from” what they consider the minuses of the city: excessive traffic, too many people, overcrowded schoolrooms, higher rents. A whole raft of reasons are cited. But these days — at least, in the part of New Jersey where I live — one does not “get away from” the city because the city is very much with us. And it manifests itself in many ways. Take my town of Montclair. It is probably, never mind probably, it is one of the more physically attractive of all the New York City suburbs. There are nice homes and lots of trees; so many trees, in fact, that you don't really miss the ones that are being killed along my street by the indiscriminate parking of cars and the subsequent discharges of oils and fluids onto the tree roots. Traffic is really very light, and most mornings the air smells just fine. The government of my town is no more inept than any other government, and it seems to respond quite well to the more‐powerful lobbies in town. Which really is very much like the cities, isn't it ? The schools are generally very good, although occasionally they resemble laboratories more than they do houses of learning. But that's all right. My town has been getting more Democrats of late, too, and this, we are told, is a sign of creeping urbanization. Suburbs generally have a lot of Republicans, and the Democrats are regarded suspiciously. To a certain extent, that's still the case in our town, but it's changing. And the change is almost a painless one because the Democrats — at least those who tend to wear the party, label seem just like Republicans. I think that's a nice development, too, since it can lead only to future harmony, which is a good thing. And there are other signs of urbanization in my town. We’ have a pornographic bookstore that does a pretty good business, a couple of fast‐food restaurants that are refugees from the city, a clinic specializing in abortions and a shop with all sorts of splendidlooking marijuana paraphernalia on display. Our newest commercial tenant is a shop that is a miniature version of those job‐lot cut‐rat e stores that are so dear to Canal and Church Streets in downtown Manhattan. In our town, policemen and firemen have to struggle to get salary increases, just like they do in the city, and our government is talking about dire budget cuts this coming year. Not so bad as in Cleveland, mind you, but enough to alarm some of the townspeople. We even have an urban‐renewal ‘plan. Of course, they don't call it urban renewal here; rather, it is suburban renewal, but it works very much the way it works in the city. First, blocks of old houses are discovered. Then it is resolved that they are not good houses, and it is further resolved that they therefore are to be destroyed. A contract is awarded for their destrtiction, and the houses are razed. For a few months, we look at flat lots with bits of rubble strewn about; then new housing goes up to replace what has been torn down. The only problem is that the new housing, not nearly as pretty or graceful as the houses that have been torn down, is filled with tiny rooms that seem as if they hem in people. Why, they might just as well live in city housing because whatever trees are around are taken down in the general wreaking and are replaced with those weedy little saplings so dear to dwellers. We even have a mall in our town — a shopping mall — which is something that the far‐thinking cities are all establishing these days. Well, we really haven't a mall. What we have is a wide brick sidewalk, with lovely new saplings replacing the trees that were torn up to make way for the mall. But that's O.K., I suppose, because at least our pseudo‐mall leads to one of our prides that often is as satisfying as Second Avenue in Manhattan: Our collection of antiques shops and first- and second‐degree flea markets that pepper our downtown shopping area. We have little places in which there have been finds as good as anything in Manhattan, and a collection of shops in our railroad station — a miniature Grand Central, by the way — that sells others’ throwaways and benefits our local Historical Society (which is also an advantage of our town). We have a rather good art museum that, while occasionally dull, is always interesting enough to warrant a pleasant hour or two ori a Sunday afternoon. And we even have rent control or, I should say, a debate about rent control that will continue in our town and continue to make us sound like the New York City Council in debate. It is warming to ex‐city people to wander into familiar territory. I will say one thing: Our parks are really better than those in the city. We swim in them, play tennis in them, hit softballs in them and bicycle in them. We enjoy them, and the people who take care of them do a far better job than their urban counterparts. Thank heaven for our parks."
Bridgeport Abortions Top Births,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/09/archives/bridgeport-abortions-top-births.html,"STAMFORD, Conn., Jan. 5 — More women chose abortions than childbirth in Bridgeport in 1978, according to estimates gathered from hospitals and health officials. Hartford had two‐thirds as many abortions as births, according to the figures. Statewide figures for 1978 are not yet available, but in 1977, Connecticut recorded 14,997 abortions and 36,350 births, and officials do not expect a major change in that proportion. Two hospitals and an abortion clinic in Bridgeport, Connecticut's largest city, reported more than 4,182 abortions, compared with an estimated of 4,108 births. It was the second year in a row that abortions exceeded childbirth there. In Hartford, hospitals recorded 4,750 abortions, while the State Health Department estimates 6,650 births last year. New Haven had more than half as many abortions as births, with over 2,760 abortions and approximately 5,240 births. Abortion is “probably one of the minor factors” in the birth‐rate decline, according to Dr. Michael Bracken, an epidemiologist at Yale Medical School. Describing unwanted pregnancies as “an epidemic,” he added that “well over half the legal abortions replace illegal abortions,” common before the 1973 United States Supreme Court decision that struck down most antiabortion laws. “There are certainly fewer children, that's well known,” he said in a telephone interview. “Whether it's because of abortion is not clear. Improved contraceptive practice, women moving into the job market, and changes in the status of women are factors.” Ironically, the state keeps closer track of abortions than it does of births, because state law requires that abortions be reported to the Health Department, while birth records are forwarded to Hartford by officials of the 169 towns which sometimes take months."
Assembly Unit Approves A Bill for a Death Penalty,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/10/archives/assembly-unit-approves-a-bill-for-a-death-penalty-measure-vetoed.html,"ALBANY, Jan. 9 — The Assembly Codes Committee today revived efforts to restore the death penalty in New York State as it approved a capital‐punishment bill and sent it to the floor The measure, which was passed quickly with almost no debate, is virtually certain to be approved by the full Assembly. The committee's quick action, however, was seen by some legislators as an attempt by the Democratic leadership to insure that an expected veto by Governor Carey would be sustained. Since an overriding vote would initially take place in the house where the legislation is first passed, Democratic leaders rushed to have the capital‐punishment measure originate in the Assembly, these sources said, since support for it there is not as strong as it is in the Senate. Measure Vetoed Last Year Last year, both the Assembly and the Senate approved a measure to restore the death penalty, but it was vetoed by Mr. Carey. An attempt to override the legislation in the Senate, where last year's bill originated, failed. A two‐thirds majority of legislators in both houses is needed to override a veto. At a news conference today, the Governor reiterated his intention to veto the legislation if it is passed again. Both Mr. Carey and Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink, who is also opposed to the death penalty, denied that the intent of today's move was to force the issue first in the Assembly. “Speaker Fink has a quality of leadership and he exercised it,” the Governor said. Mr. Fink, a Brooklyn Democrat, said that the decision to move quickly on the measure was made because debate on the issue was inevitable and that he was anxious to move onto other matters. “I can't see it lingering, lingering, lingering,” he said of the capital punishment bill. “If it is going to happen eventually, let's get going on it.” The bill sent to the floor today could be taken up as early as next Monday, according to Melvin H. Miller of Brooklyn, the Codes Committee chairman. The legislation is the same as the bill passed by both houses last year. The bill would authorize, executions in any of a series of “intentional murders” — including the murder of a police officer, a contract killing and a murder committed during a robbery, burglary or rape. The death penalty, however, would be imposed in a proceeding separate from the original trial by a jury charged specificaly with weighing whether such a sentence were warranted by factors “aggravating” to the crime itself. Assembly Overriding Unlikely The debate over the identical bill last year was lengthy and rivaled in emotionalism the fight over ending Medicaid subsidies for abortions. The capital‐punishment bill was passed first in the Senate by a vote of 39 to 19 and then in the Assembly, 94 to 51. After the Governor's veto, an attempt to override in the Senate failed by the same vote. 39 to 19. Forty votes were needed to override a veto. With changes in the Sente as a result of the November elections, legislative head counters believe that there are now the necessary votes to override a veto. In the Assembly, however, most counts show that supporters are short of the 100 necessary votes. At a news conference today, Warren M. Anderson, the Binghamton Republican who is the Senate majority leader, said that he had “no plans” to try to regain the initiative by introducing a slightly different version of the bill in his house. The desire of the Assembly Codes Committee to quickly vote out the bill was evident this morning, when Mr. Miller, long an opponent of the death penalty, voted for the bill. Two members of his committee who were known as supporters were absent. Rather than wait until they would be present, Mr. Miller cast the deciding vote to get the issue to the floor. He pledged to vote against the bill in the Assembly. “We've debated this issue seven times since I've been here,” said Mr. Miller, who came to the Assembly in 1970. “We're going to have to confront this issue again. We might as well do it now.”"
BUSINESS PEOPLE,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/10/archives/business-people-exgov-perpich-joins-control-data-johnson-trusjoist.html,"Former Gov. Rudy Perpich of Minnesota, the maverick from the Mesabi Range who was defeated in an upset last November, is going to work for Control Data Corporation overseas. “This is my third career,” said Mr. Perpich, 50 years old, who was a practicing dentist until he entered politics. He will become vice president and executive consultant to Control Data Worldtech Inc., an international trade division of the Minneapolis‐based computer concern. “This will be an opportunity for me to promote Minnesota in international trade, breaking down barriers,” he said. Mr. Perpich is expected to be based in Yugoslavia, but he said he could find himself in Hungary, Bulgaria or Rumania. The move represents a completing of the immigration circle for the Perpich family. His father was born in Yugoslavia and came to Minnesota to work in the iron mines. The younger Mr. Perpich is the first Governor of Minnesota from the iron range and the first of Eastern European descent. Both he and his wife speak Croatian, one of the two national languages of Yugoslavia. The other is Serbian. Mr. Perpich was named Governor as part of a game of political musical chairs in December I976, when Walter F. Mondale left the Senate to become Vice President. Gov. Wendell R. Anderson then resigned. Mr. Perpich, the Lieutenant Governor, succeeded him and then appointed him to the vacant Senate seat. The former dentist's term was brief. He ran on his own on the DemocraticFarmer‐Labor ticket last November and was upset by his Republican opponent, Representative Albert H. Quie, in what was widely interpreted as a victory for so‐called right-to-life groups in Minnesota. Both men had taken anti. abortion stands. but the right-no-life groups apparrently felt Mr. Quic had done more for them. Johnson, Trus‐Joist Part What happens to young company presidents who rack up a 65 percent profit increase in one year and help push the stock from 12 to more than 50 in about six months? If they are like Peter Johnson at the Trus‐Joist Corporation, they apparently get into a fight with the chairman and resign. Mr. Johnson, 46 years old and president of the Boise‐based concern since 1973, resigned unexpectedly Monday as president and chief executive officer. apparently over a widening philisophical rift between himself and Harold Thomas, board chairman and a co- founder of the company. The company said “personality differences” prompted the resignation. Walter Minnick, vice president of operations, has assumed Mr. Johnson duties as president, and insiders said he had the inside track for the top position. The company makes a patented wooden I‐beam using a continuous lamination process and existing plywood technology. Trus‐Joist officials say it will replace the traditional 2by10 floor joist More Executive Shifts at Garrett You may recall that on Monday Edward J. Garrett, chairman of the Instrument Systems Corporation, Huntington, LI., was named president following the dismissal of his brother Bernard from the job. Another brother, Irving, who was a vice president, was also discharged, along with Allan LaBel, another vice president. Edward Garrett is not a man to shilly‐shally. While still declining to explain the whys of the changes, he made the following announcements yesterday: Allen Kaden will assume the duties of Leonard Goldstein, vice president, operations, and treasurer of the Lightron Corporation subsidiary, replacing Mr. Goldstein, whose services were terminated. Martin Cross, executive ace president of Bendix Mouldings, a subsidiary, was named president, replacing Elliot Braunstein, whose services were terminated. Henry Jampol was named president of Laurel Lamp, a subsidiary, replacing Harold Weiss, whose services were terminated. At the Crossley Window division, Frank Sally will assume the duties of Dominick Cianciulli, the president. whose services were terminated. William L. Hockett, formerly vire president of the F. & S. Central subsidiary, was named president, replacing Stanley Furer, whose services were terminated. Martin Slavin was named president of the Telephonics Corporation subsidiary, replacing Daniel Fiore, whose services were terminated. In addition, according to a spokesman for the company, “other employ. ees in various staff positions have been terminated or reassigned.” Mr. Garrett may not be a new broom. but he does sweep clean. Instrument Systems makes electronics, lighting, communications and building products and is traded on the American Stock Exchange. Pacific Gas Pays Widener $300,000 Donald Widener, a Los Angeles television producer and film writer, was $300,000 richer yesterday thanks to a decision by Pacific Gas and Electric Company to settle a libel action he brought against the company in 1971. According to the terms of the out‐of court settlement, Mr. Widener was paid $300,000 and his lawyer, ,David Pesonen, was paid $175,000. Mr. Widener was not available for comment, but Mr. Pesonen said he was “very happy” because he had also just sold a film for $150,000. Mr. Widener originally sued an official of the power company charging that the official had asserted that Mr. Widener had recorded and filmed his activities surreptitiously and then dubbed the interview into a controversial television film on nuclear power. Following a 1975 trial, a jury awarded Mr. Widener $7.76 million, all but $8,00 of which was to be paid by Pacific Gas and Electric, whose engineer, James C. Carroll, made the original accusations. Mr. Carroll was to pay the $8,000. The trial judge reversed the verdict on the ground that malice had not been proved. The California Court of Appeals ordered a new trial, maintaining that the damages were excessive. Finally, the Supreme Court upheld the appellate court's demand for a new trial. Both sides agreed to an out-of-court setttlement before the new trial could begin. Mr. Widener was a publicity man for KNBC‐TV in Los Angeles when he made the controversial film, called “Powers That Be.” He asserted in his suit that the charges against him prevented him from winning any television contracts from 1971 to 1976. This despite the fact that he had won awards for two earlier fliers, one on air pollution and the other on ecological pmt At one point, according to Mr. Pesonen, his client was reduced to selling his car for $50 and using buses to get to fruitless studio conference:. All that has changed now, but Mr. Widener made a key concession to the power company in the settlement. He will not write a book or an article or make any films about the case."
High Court Voids an Abortion Law Limiting Doctor Choice of Method,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/10/archives/high-court-voids-an-abortion-law-limiting-doctor-choice-of-method.html,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 — By a 6‐to‐3 vote, the Supreme Court today declared unconstitutional a Pennsylvania law that required a doctor performing an abortion to choose the abortion method most likely to save the life of a fetus that might be old enough to survive outside the womb. The majority called the law “little more than a trap for those who act in good faith” and said it could have a “profound chilling effect on the willingness of physicians to perform abortions near the point of viability in the manner indicated by their best medical judgment.” Under the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act, a physician who did not try to save a potentially viable fetus could be subject to criminal charges. As the majority interpreted the law, these charges could have included murder, although the dissent vigorously disputed this interpretation. The decision, Colautti v. Franklin (No. 71‐891), was written by Associate Justice Harry A. Blackmun, who wrote the landmark 1973 decision holding that a constitutional right of privacy prohibited state from interfering with a woman's decision to terminate an early pregnancy. That decision said that once the fetus was viable, or able to survive outside the womb, the state could regulate or even prohibit abortion. But Justice Blackmun said today that Pennsylvania had taken that invitation too far by requiring the doctor, if he either determines that the fetus “is viable” or if “there is sufficient reason to believe that the fetus may be viable,” to use the abortion technique “which would provide the best opportunity for the fetus to be aborted alive.” Other Laws Challenged Similar laws are under legal challenge around the country. But they are not identical to the Pennsylvania law, so the immediate impact of today's decision beyond Pennsylvania is not clear. Pro‐abortion spokesman said, however, that decision upholding the Pennsylvania law would have encouraged the adoption of such laws in other states. Justice Blackmun found two basic faults with the Pennsylvania law: that the “may be viable” language was unconstitutionally vague and that the law tried to second‐guess the doctor in making what is essentially a medical decision. “The present statute does not afford broad discretion to the physician,” the majority said. “Instead, it conditions potential criminal liability on confusing and ambiguous criteria. It therefore presents serious problems of notice, discriminatory application, and chilling effect on the exercise of constitutional rights.” Justice Blackmun was joined in the majority by William J. Brennan Jr., Potter Stewart, Thurgood Marshall, Lewis F. Powell Jr. and John Paul Stevens. A dissent by Associate Justice Byron R. White complained that the majority, “now withdraws from the states a substantial measure of the power to protect fetal life that was reserved to them” in Justice Blaclmun's 1973 decision. Justice White was joined by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Associate Justice William H. Rehnquist. Pennsylvania passed its abortion law the year after the 1973 decision. Dr. John Franklin, medical director of a Planned Parenthood chapter in the state, brought the lawsuit. Other sections of the law, including a requirement that a woman obtain her husband's consent for an abortion and that teen‐aged girls obtain their parents’ consent, had earlier been declared unconstitutional and were not before the Supreme Court today. Other jurisdictions — Louisiana, South Carolina and the City of Akron, Ohio —have similar but not identical antiabortion laws, which are now being challenged in the courts."

Jersey Abortion Rule Is Overturned,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/11/archives/jersey-abortion-rule-is-overturned.html,"NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., Jan. 10 (AP) — The State of New Jersey was ordered yesterday to pay for medically necessary abortions for boor women. Judge David D. Furman of the State Superior Court, said the state's ban on Medicaid payments for abortions unless the mother's life was threatened was in conflict with governing Federal law. The New Jersey statute “must therefore be held invalid as a breach of this state's obligation as a participating state to provide its share of Medicaid funding for necessary medical services including abortions.” Judge Furman ruled on a class‐action suit instituted last summer after a Newark welfare recipient, identified only as E. M., went to court in an attempt to force the state to pay for her abortion. The New Jersey statute was signed by Governor Byrne in December 1975, but was enjoined a month later by a Federal judge. The injunction that prevented enforcement of the law was lifted in August 1977 after the United States Supreme Court ruled that states did not have to pay for all Medicaid abortions. Joan Vermeulen, an attorney for Essex‐Newark Legal Services, which brought the suit, said that before the ban was enforced about 900 Medicaid abortions had been performed each month. The number dropped to between 12 and 25 once the statute was enforced. In his 24page opinion, the judge said the number of births to women eligible for Medicaid increased by 30 percent while the ban was enforced."
"Screen: Visconti's 'The Innocent,' an Elegant Finale:Passions Rule",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/12/archives/screen-viscontis-the-innocent-an-elegant-finalepassions-rule.html,"THOUGH it's sometimes difficult to associate the neo-realism of Luchino Visconti's early films, especially ""Ossessione"" and ""La Terra Trema,"" with the operatic indulgences of ""The Damned,"" ""Ludwig"" and ""Death in Venice,"" the connections are there — and not simply in the visual elegance of all his work. The more profound connections are in the passions that rule Visconti's principal characters, whether a lusty, sex-starved mistress of a roadside inn, a Sicilian aristocrat at the time of Italy's unification, or an upper-class Roman wife who manages to betray her philendering husband in a way that confers on him an unbearable innocence.This last is more or less the heart of ""The Innocent,"" Visconti's last film (completed in 1976 shortly before his death) and among the most beautiful and severely disciplined films he has ever made. It goes a long way toward erasing the memory of ""Conversation Piece,"" that curiously (sometimes ludicrously) awkward talk-film that opened the 1975 New York Film Festival and seemed emotionally charged to some Visconti admirers, who saw it as an old man's summing up.""The Innocent,"" based on Gabriele D'Annunzio's 1892 novel (published in this country in 1898 as ""The Intruder""), which I haven't read, may well keep to the spirit if not the letter of the original, as Visconti said some time before his death. More importantly, it exemplifies Visconti's social concerns, though in terms of a story so limited in its field of vision and so precise in its details that it comes as something of a shock when, at the conclusion, one realizes the real magnitude of the work.The turn-of-the-century world of ""The Innocent,"" though small, is no microcosm. It is exactly what it seems to be, a world of fashionable drawing rooms, music rooms and bedrooms in ancient Roman palaces and immaculately tended country villas, where incomes are enormous but invisible, and where affairs of the heart have almost nothing to do with the soul and everything to do with the body.Tullio (Giancarlo Giannini) is a perfect specimen of his time and place. He is rich, handsome, arrogant, self-confident and cruel, with a beautiful wife Giuliana (Laura Antonelli) whom he once loved and now fondles as a sister, which allows him the freedom to pursue his equally beautiful mistress, Teresa (Jennifer O'Neill), a widowed countess who is quite as self-absorbed as he.Though Tullio fancies himself a realist, completely in charge of his emotions, he is struck with a suddenly renewed, totally baffling (to him) love for his wife when he learns she has been having an affair with a young novelist. This new love is different from all the others he has experienced. It may even be real. Magnanimously he offers to overlook Giuliana's indiscretion until he learns that she is pregnant with the novelist's child.Though the novelist conveniently dies, Tullio tries unsuccessfully to persuade Giuliana to agree to an abortion. She refuses to go against church law, which infuriates Tullio, who thinks of himself as an atheist. ""The earth is the only country I belong to,"" he says. ""When I die, that's the end of it. I live now."" In the most sunny, civilized, well-ordered and well-mannered of worlds, the lives of Tullio and Giuliana are wrecked by their passions, as fatally as if they'd gone down with a luxury yacht in the middle of the Adriatic.""The Innocent"" has a surprising kind of narrative balance, a shapeliness that is not characteristic of Visconti though it serves to implement his larger concerns with the individual in his own society. In ""The Innocent"" these concerns are reflected in major scenes as well as in the most seemingly casual images, such as a series of shots of the guests at a piano recital sitting in the manner of beings frozen in time. Even the women's costumes, with their wasp waists, their veils and their parasols, suggest psychological constraints — bonds that eventually snap in the series of revelations that concludes the film.Although ""The Innocent"" is one of Visconti's most beautiful films, the décor is essential to its meaning. ""The Innocent"" is also one of Visconti's most terse, most dramatically economical films. There's not a superfluous frame in it. Further, it is splendidly performed by Mr. Giannini, who indulges none of the comic mannerisms that are standard equipment in his work for Lina Wertmuller, and by Miss Antonelli, whose childlike face and voluptuous body combine to form a kind of ideograph that tells us what the film is all about.It is difficult to judge Miss O'Neill's performance. She looks great but her Italian dialogue has been dubbed, sometimes none too carefully, though for that matter all of the dialogue sounds post-synchronized.""The Innocent,"" which opens today at the Gemini II Theater, is a fitting coda to the Visconti career. It's a film of effortless command in which the director's presence is everywhere felt — and nowhere intrudes.

POLITICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/14/archives/connecticut-opinion-politics-looking-into-mrs-grassos-crystal-ball.html,"HARTFORD 0N paper Ella Grasso looks like solid gold. Twice elected to Congress, Mrs. Grasso, who has never lost an election in her quarter of a century in politics, now begins her second term as Governor of Connecticut. She is by seniority and position the highest‐ranking woman in American politics today. The only women who come close to reaching her accomplishments are Dixie Lee Ray, who is serving her first term as Governor of the State of Washington, and Nancy Kassenbaum of Kansas, who is serving her first term as United States Senator. There are no hints of scandal in Governor Grasso's career. The state has functioned well enough during her administration. With’ her middle-of-theroad and conservative philosophies, she has frustrated people, but not alienated them. Her political enemies have been conquered and her previous trou- bles with President Carter seem to have subsided. In an era when talented, successful women are increasingly in demand, Governor Grasso, at the seasoned age of 59, would appear to be not at the end of her career, but, to play on her own analogy, blooming, fully ripened and ready for picking. Whenever the Governor is asked about seeking higher office, she says she is not interested, that she wants to “bloom” where she is “planted,” at least until 1982. Not long ago, she used to get a lot of questions on whether she wanted to run for Governor, and she said no. She does not demonstrate the raw ambition that Is a usual prerequisite to success on a national level. In fact, there is substantial evidence that she shuns the very power she has worked so hard to earn. She refused to pick her running mates last year and left the decisions of her ticket to the delegates at the State Democratic Convention. In 1977, when the state budget included an 11 percent increase in state spending, which was largely a reflection of her own proposals, she refused to deal with it. She did not sign it, she did not veto it ; she let it become law through her inaction. Mrs. Grasso was one of the last people in Congress to call for former President Richard M. Nixon's impeach. ment. Last year when she discharged Daniel McKinnon, a Republican, as the new head of the Department of Administrative Services, she refused to go for the jugular. Her public explanation for the action concerned poor morale in the department, and Mr. McKinnon was able to get a lot of mileage out of his yet unsubstantiated charges that she was politically manipulating government contracts. Since Mrs. Grasso seldom makes it clear what she is thinking, however, it is easy to weave facts into a distorted web. She almost never publicly speaks her mind, but there are a few notable occasions when she has revealed herself to be a woman of strong spirit. And if it is allowed that passion and ambition are closely related, her long‐time allies privately maintain that 'she has it. “Ella is a sore winner who resents any kind of challenge,” said one friendly veteran Democrat. Publicly, she occasionally has been emphatic. On state financing for abortions she said, “I do not wish to be a party to killing the children of the poor.” And during the gubernatorial race last year she called her opponent, Robert Killian, the former lieutenant governor, a “son of a bitch.” But even assuming that she hides a secret yearning for higher office, her future of course, also depends on how she is viewed nationally. Her relations with the President, which were soured initially by her late endorsement of Mr. Carter during the 1976 Presidential campaign, seem to be sweetening. During her re‐election bid last year, nearly every member of the Carter family, including the President, ventured to Connecticut to campaign for her. And even if you assume thay President Carter is only protecting himself from possible re‐election problems with Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, the results remain the same: Mrs. Grasso's ties to the White House appear to have new strength. But another factor in her relations with powers outside of Connecticut is that outsiders often have no appreciation of what a slow‐ball league she plays in. Republican opposition here is limp, as witnessed by last year's campaign. The game of cut‐throat politics just is not played in Connecticut. Moreover, this is a wealthy state, its businesses are growing, the main problems are those of the city and the populace seems inclined for her to leave them there. True, she has steered the state through difficult economic times and she has insisted on difficult, austere fiscal measures, but when she is credited with the rebound, a healthy part of the credit must also go to improved national economic conditions. Much depends on the political needs of the moment when considering the question of Mrs. Grasso's possible new national prominence. She may, like al- most every other Democrat in the state, have her eye on Senator Abraham. Ribicoff's seat. His term expires in 1980. But he has not said he is going to give it up yet. Representative Christopher J. Dodd is widely thought to hunger for the Senate seat, and last year he was leading Mrs. Grasso in the polls. But anything can happen politically in two years. Governor Grasso has often been mentioned as a vice presidential candidate. President Carter has indicated no dissatisfaction with Walter Mondale, so that option would seem to be out. However, there is lots of talk in Washington these days of cabinet reshuffling. Senator Kennedy may run for President in 1980, but two Northeasterners would seem an unlikely ticket. Some observers say that Governor Gerald Brown of California and Governor Grasso would make a striking ticket: the liberal and the conservative. The geography is right and for those who still think of Governor Brown as something of a brash young upstart, there would be Mrs. Grasso at his side. ■"

WASHINGTON. President Carter's Half‐Time Mood,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/14/archives/washington-president-carters-halftime-mood.html,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 13 — President Carter is coming down to the second anniversary of his inauguration in remarkably good spirits. All the recent troubles abroad in Iran, Cambodia, Israel and Egypt, and all the anxiety over the dollar and inflation at home do not seem to have shaken his confidence as he goes into the second half of his term. He appears to have survived the frantic pace of the last two years in good physical condition, somewhat leaner — and less dogmatic — than when he walked down Pennsylvania Avenue and into the White House with his wife two years ago. He is also a little more defensive about criticism of his record. He looks at the past two years and the next two years as follows: • On the U.S. Economy: He isn't sure that anybody can manage an economy so complex in such a turbulent world and in such a vast continental country as the United States. He is doing all he can to keep the economy strong, cut down on the budget deficit (which he notes has been reduced by half since he took office), keep the American people employed, meet the social needs of the country within essential budget restraints, etc. This, of course, is the heart of the controversy. • On the U.S. Dollar:He doesn't believe there is anything else he can do to stabilize its value at the present time. He has established a very large reserve fund. He has intervened very slightly to maintain the dollar almost constant since last Nov. 1. But the inflationary pressures are severe, he says, and for the next few months they are going to be quite disappointing. • On the Reaction of Big Business: The President feels he has had fairly good cooperation from business leaders. The Administration is now monitoring 600 top corporations, with their cooperation, on wage and price levels, and while they don't like it, they recognize and agree with him on the primary problem of inflation. • On the Reaction of Big Labor: We have a series of test cases coming up, Mr. Carter says. The first will be the oil workers and his information is that they and the Teamsters are trying to go along with his wage’ guidelines, limiting increases to about 7 percent. • But he cannot be sure, he says, about the ultimate results. The only thing he can guarantee, he insists, is his own commitment to try to keep the budget and the deficit and unemployment down as far as possible while preserving the security of the poor and raising the defense budget for the military security of the nation. Mr. Carter was sympathetic to both objectives but he obviously didn't resolve the dilemma. He was more specific, but still vaguely cautious, about the politics of all these problems. He was asked whether it had crossed his mind that the 1980 Presidential election had already started. He had thought’ about that, he said with that sudden Carter smile and glint of the eye. What was the former Governor of Georgia going to do about that? Had he thought about the suggestion of the Governor of California that there be a constitutional convention to amend the Constitution of the United States in order to compel a balanced Federal budget? What was the Governor of California saying? Well, Mr. Carter said, he didn't quite know and didn't want to comment on him. But the President said he thought that one of the worst things he could imagine would be the converting of an uncontrolled and uncontrollable constitutional convention, at which every radical group in the country could put forward, possibly successfully, massive amendments to the basic document. This, the President said, would be a drastic departure from the history of the country and he thought it would give rise to an uncontrollable deluge of Constitutional amendments concerning not only taxation, but abortion, states’ rights, local rights, and almost every other controversial issue. Lobbying groups, emotional in nature and well financed, would have a field day if they could amend the Constitution at such a convention. The President was asked whether he had made up his mind about running for re‐election in 1980 —with Governor Brown crying for massive budget cuts on his right and Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts arguing for massive budget expenditures for health and welfare and other things on his left. Mr. Carter paused and smiled again. He had never worried about his political opponents, he said. When he ran for the governorship of Georgia, he was the underdog, he recalled, and when he ran for the Presidency, it was the same. He had never let that worry him and it didn't worry him now. When, then, would he make up his mind about the election of 1980, he was asked. His mind was already made up, he replied, leaving ‘no doubt that he was going for a second term ; he was just not ready to announce his intentions, not before sometime late this year. He didn't want all the many immediate questions facing him to be considered in terms of his candidacy or noncandidacy. At the same time Mr. Carter worries about the problems of the Near East, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. In fact his mind seems to be more on these foreign policy questions of arms control and world order than anything else — and his observations on these problems will be reported here in another column."
Ideas &Trends,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/14/archives/ideas-trends-a-genetic-link-is-identified-for-some-ulcers-a-shift.html,"Peptic ulcers are one of the commonest of serious diseases — and one of the least understood. Doctors have presumed that the causes are both genetic and environmental but have had trouble identifying particular factors. Last week The New England Journal of Medicine reported the strongest evidence to date linking heredity to many peptic ulcers. Specifically, researchers say that persons who have inherited a high level of something called pepsinogen I in their blood are five times as likely as other persons to have an ulcer. Doctors studied two large families with histories of duodenal ulcers. Measuring the pepsinogen I in their subjects’ blood, the doctors found that a high level of the chemical is a genetic trait that can be passed on by mothers or fathers to 50 percent of their children. Duodenal ulcers were found in 40 percent of those who possessed the trait .but in none of those without it. The findings suggest that some petple may be genetically predisposed to ulcers, and that environmental factors, as yet unidentified, may trigger the disease. The research is a step toward prevention. Theoretically, at least, doctors could identify ulcer‐prone persons, note which ones developed ulcers and which did not, and perhaps discover environmental differences between the two groups that might explain Why one group became ill. Controlling those factors might help prevent some ulcers. The pharmaceutical industry — a $10-billion-a-year business — makes 90 percent of its profits on brand‐name drugs. That may be the reason consumer advocates are finding it difficult to promote the sale of generics, the cheaper counterparts of tradenamed prescription drugs. Last week the Federal Government bolstered the consumer position. The Food and Drug Administration released a list of 2,400 drugs, naming the chemical equivalents of branded products and thus easing the task of doctors who want to'precribe and patients who want to buy the least expensive version of any drug. The Department of Health, Education and Welfare also announced that it would publish the wholesale prices of all drugs. The list is expected to help consumer advocates by confirming that the retail price markup on drugs is very high (averaging at least 66 percent). And the health department, acting with the Federal Trade Commission, published a “model drug product selection act” for possible enactment by states. The model statute makes it troublesome for doctors to precribe brand names because it requires them to write “medically necessary” if they call for a trade‐named product. Existing laws, by contrast, often make it harder to order generics by requiring that doctors write a phrase such as “substitution permitted.” Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare Joseph A. Califano Jr. said that the generic equivalents list, which has only implied Government endorsement now, will be given official status before the year is out. The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association has sued to prevent that from happening. Its argument is that generics do not always work exactly like branded drugs and that efforts to promote generics undermine the authority of doctors and the ability of drug firms to finance research. In New York, many druggists and doctors have resisted the state's new drug substitution law. One reason doctors prescribe branded drugs, Michael Pertschuk, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, said last week, is that drug companies spend $2,400 a year per practicing doctor to insure that brand names are “indelibly stamped in the physician's mind.” Since the Supreme Court's landmark ruling in 1973 that no state could prohibit abortion before the final 10 weeks of pregnancy, Federal and state legislators have erected such barriers as they could to execution of the Court's sweeping principle, Some such efforts, for example Congress’ ban on the use of Medicaid funds for abortions, have passed the Court's scrutiny. But last week, the Court struck down a Pennsylvania law requiring doctors to choose the method of abortion most likely to allow a fetus that “may be viable” to survive. Logically, if the fetus survives an abortion, there has been no abortion. The Court's opinion did not, however, turn on that point. Writing for the &‐3 majority, Associate Justice Harry A. Blackmun, who also wrote the 1973 decision, said the “may be viable” language was unconstitutionally vague, and that state legislatures could not second‐guess doctors by prescribing in advance what their professional decisions in individual cases should be. Other sections of the Pennsylvania law, requiring women to obtain the consent of their husbands and teenaged girls that of their parents, had already been voided by lower courts. Several other jurisdictions have laws similar to the Pennsylvania statute, but not identical, so the full effect of the Court's ruling is not clear. Like the earth's climate, the Supreme Court has a long history of going this way for a long time and then going that way. And like climatologists, court‐watchers wonder whether the next development will carry recent trends further, or swing back toward an earlier cycle. Last week, the Court accepted two libel cases that seem pointed toward a possible Ice Age for the press's right to say pretty much what it feels like saying about socalled “public figures.” Both plaintiffs in last week's cases had lost in lower courts because they were held to be public figures. In one, a psychologist had been ridiculed by one of Senator William Proxmire's “golden fleece” press releases, but had been ruled a public figure because he had solicited Government grants and published articles. In the other, a man listed in a book as a Soviet spy in 1974 was adjudged a public figure because, an appeals court said, he had invited public attention by defying a grand jury subpoena in 1958. Why is a “public figure” different? In 1964, the Supreme Court ruled that, to sue successfully for libel, public officials would have to show they had been defamed “with malice” — that a publisher had doubted the truth of his accusations, or not cared. In 1967, the Court extended the doctrine to “public figures,” and in 1971 to private individuals in cases of public interest. Eight justices wrote five opinions in the 1971 case, and ever since, the Court has been backing away from its result. In 1974, it excluded from the “public figure” category private citizens who neither were well‐known nor had forced themselves into controversy. In 1976, it found that a Florida socialite was not a public figure even though she had given press conferences during her divorce proceedings. That artificial insemination has been used by human beings for 200 years is well blown. Less familiar is the increasing reliance on sperm banks. At a family planning symposium sponsored by the American Association for the Advancement of Science last week Dr. Armand M. Kamm Jr. of the Medical College of Georgia estimated that frozen sperm is now used in from 10 percent to 20 percent of all attempts at artificial insemination. A decade ago the figure was about 1 percent. Doctors used to fear that freezing sperm could alter chromosomes and lead to the birth of defective offspring, but experience suggests otherwise. Reporting on a survey of 3,000 children whose mothers were inseminated with thawed sperm that had been frozen from several months to 10 years, Dr. J. K. Sherman of the University of Arkansas College of Medicine said that fewer than 1 percent had birth defects. In the general population, more than 6 percent of children are born abnormal. Dr. Sherman attributes the reduced rate not to the use of frozen sperm but to careful timing in artificial insemination and to screening of the donor, his sperm and the recipient. Using frozen sperm increases the number of available donors and cuts down on certain diseases because frozen sperm, unlike fresh semen, can be “quarantined” until it is certain that the sperm will not transmit disease. The central committee of the World Council of Churches, meeting in Jamaica, voted last week to continue its controversial Program to Combat Racism. Since 1969 the program has awarded $2.6 million, contributed by member churches and by several Western European governments, to various causes that, in the Council's judgment, are antiracist. Such grants have included $85,000 to the Patriotic Front, the Rhodesian guerrilla group. Though the money is earmarked for humanitarian purposes — medical care and the like — critics point out that such a sum, even if used for medicine, frees a like amount of the Patriotic Front's finances to pursue violence. In voting to continue the program, the central committee made a few concessions to critics. It agreed to extensive review of the program with member churches, including consultation with member churches in any continent where an antiracist grant or project is contemplated.

Job Threats to Workers’ Fertility Emerging as Civil Liberties Issue,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/15/archives/job-threats-to-workers-fertility-emerging-as-civil-liberties-issue.html,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 14 — When Christine Schwalm became pregnant several weeks ago, she and her doctor decided that exposure to industrial chemicals on the job might be dangerous to her unborn baby. So Mrs. Schwalm, who was a photography laboratory technician for Bechtel Inc. in Gaithersburg, Md., took a letter from the doctor to her supervisors and asked for a transfer to a job that did not expose her to the chemicals. The supervisors told her that there was no evidence that any of the chemicals were hazardous and that, anyway, there was no other job available for which she was qualified. Then they discharged her. Mrs. Schwalm's experience, like those of a growing number of workers in chemical plants, nuclear installations and other hazardous workplaces, signals the emergence of a major new civil rights and civil liberties issue that poses medical, legal, economic and moral dilemmas. The issue involves, first of all, the right of fertile women to hold jobs and not suffer discrimination. It also involves the even larger, more emotional and more portentous question of the threat to the reproductive capacity and genetic stability of hundreds of thousands of men and women whose jobs expose them to substances that can cause sterility or cause mental or physical deformity in fetuses. The issue came to public attention recently when four West Virginia women told of having themselves sterilized to keep their well‐paying jobs in a lead pigment plant operated by the American Cyanamid Corporation. That company has a policy of removing women of child bearing age from, or not hiring them for, jobs that expose them to lead or other substances that could damage a fetus. “If American Cyanamid and others can get away with removing women of child‐bearing age from these jobs, we will have established the principle of altering the worker to the configuration of the workplace instead of altering the configuration of the workplace to protect the worker,” said Anthony Mazzocchi, vice president of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union, which is challenging American Cyanamid's policies. Mr. Mazzocchi and others, including the Federal Government's Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, insist that the solution should be to make the workplace safe for workers, and Mr. Mazzocchi said he is forming a coalition to demand worker protection against discrimination and against genetic damage in the workplace. “This is the real right‐to‐life issue,” he asserted. “What we are talking about is the right of workers to conceive and bear healthy children.” He noted that there was ample evidence that some materials affect the reproductive capacities and genetic makeup of men as well as women, and he said that inevitably men also would be confronted with a choice between their livelihood and parenthood. “Eventually, thousands upon thousands of jobs would require that workers of child‐bearing capacity be excluded,” he said. “You then wind up with an entire class of neutered workers.” Corporate policies excluding female workers from some jobs are usually defended as protective. “It is not that the female is unique, but that we are attempting to protect the fetus. We are talking about exposures that won't hurt the mother but to which the fetus is sensitive,” said Dr. Bruce W. Karrh, corporate medical director of E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, which excludes women of child‐bearing potential from certain jobs. “We are just beginning to see the possibility that there are some situations where the risk through the father must be considered,” he added. Safe Level Is Termed Unknown The Du Pont official said he basically agreed that the best way to safeguard workers and their unborn children would be to clean up the workplace. “But,” he said, “first of all it is not technically and economically feasible to clean it up to a safe level. And, second, we don't have the data to know what is a safe level. But I will say that this is a problem that occupational health specialists are starting to look at very seriously.” The extent and nature of the problem has dawned on Government, business, the unions and scientists only in the last few years and is only now bubbling up to policy‐making levels. “We really don't know the scope of the problem we are facing, but we know that socially we have a problem,” Eula Bingham, Assistant Secretary of Labor for occupational health and safety, has said. She noted in a recent speech that 200,000 children are born in the United Sates each year and that 10 percent suffer from serious birth defects. There are many “inexplicable” spontaneous abortions and still births, she said. “Yet the more we learn about the effects of environmental toxic exposures on reproduction, the more we suspect that it is a substantial burden,” she said. Dr. Bingham said that the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health now lists 56 mutagens — substances that can damage or change genetic structures — and 471 teratogens, substances that can create physical or mental deformities. Practice Called ‘Protective’ No one seems to know the full extent of the practice of excluding women of childbearing age from jobs involving exposure to toxic substances. A recent NBC news program named American Cyanamid, Dow Chemical, Monsanto, Du Pont, General Motors, Allied Chemical, Bunker Hill Smelting, St. Joseph Zinc, Eastman Kodak and Firestone Tire and Rubber as companies that pursue exclusionary practices against women of child‐bearing age —“protective discrimination” the practice is sometimes called. Some Companies transfer pregnant women to other jobs, letting them keep their seniority and pay levels. But it is likely that there are many thousands of cases like Christine Schwalm's, in which women lose their jobs or suffer employment disadvantages because of their child‐bearing potential, though the company has no explicit policy. Those disadvantages include being transferred to jobs that pay less. Dr. Bingham and others noted that only in recent years had women gained jobs in factories and elsewhere that had been held exclusively by males and that tended to be better‐paying than traditional “women's work.” “Now that they have managed to get a foot in the door, they fear this reproductive issue is being used to exclude them,” Dr. Bingham said. Sue Nelson, director of the office of policy analysis for OSHA, said that men are rarely removed from jobs to protect their reproductive functions. And yet, OSHA officials agree, men are also susceptible to cell damage from exposure to toxic chemicals, and it may be damage to the husband that causes a sterile marriage, a miscarriage or a deformed baby. John Freund, who recently prepared lead exposure standards for OSHA, said the father's exposure to lead “is just as dangerous to the fetus” as the mother's. It is believed that the pesticide DBCP caused workers engaged in its production to become sterile. OSHA fined a hormone manufacturer in Chicago after male employees of the company complained that their breasts had become enlarged and they had become impotent. And workers who were exposed to kepone and who suffered severe damage to their nervous and reproductive systems also are believed to have carried the dangerous chemical home in their clothing thus affecting their families. “What this is really about is that the employers are trying to save themselves from expensive lawsuits,” Miss Nelson said. “It is easier for a woman worker than a man to bring a lawsuit against a company on behalf of a fetus.” Andrea Hricko, health coordinator of the University of California's occupational health program, asserted in a telephone interview that employers excluded women employees from potentially dangerous exposure to chemicals for economic reasons. “It is cheaper than cleaning up the workplace,” she said."
Bella Abzug's Ouster and Limits of Dissent,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/16/archives/bella-abzugs-ouster-and-limits-of-dissent-news-analysis.html,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 15 — President Carter's abrupt tlimissal of Bella S. Abzug from his National Advisory Committee on Women appears to reflect not only his irritation with her confrontational style, but also the urging of his ad- ‘risers to project a decisive image in preparation for the re election drive he is expected to mount in 1980. But the controversy, which continued to ferment News Analysis today, also raises difficult questions about the proper role of an advisory committee and the limits of legitimate dissent. The furor over the dismissal has also underscored some of the substantive differences over economic and social policy that separate Mr. Carter from the socalled “Kennedy wing” of the Democratic Party — the more militant feminists, blacks and labor leaders who are rxisning for ambitious new domestic programs. The incident seemed to indicate how thin‐skinned Mr. Carter and his top aides have become to what they perceive as disloyal criticism of his performance from within the Administration. And also revived suspicions among mAny feminists of what they regard as the male chauvinism of Mr. Carter's Georgia‐bred advisers, especially Hamilton Jordan, his top political aide. Weighing the public reaction to the dismissal today, White [louse, officials seemed confident that the President's move would prove ultimately to he political plus, Even though 26 of the 40 Carter‐appointed members of the advisory committee have resigned in protest, the Administration expects to reconstitide the group soon and find replacements for the co‐chairmen. The President's press secretary, Jody Powell, said that, of the 170 telephone calls received by the White 11 house switch boa rd in the first two hours of business this morning, 87 percent supported the President. This tended to confirm the judgment of Mr. Carter's political aides that, while Mrs. Abzug may have the support of organized groups of politically active women, she does not necessarily represent American women at large. The dismissal fits in with the new tougher and more “Presidential” posture that Mr. Carter's advisers have been urging him to adopt in his third year in office. At all costs, they want him to avoid giving the itnpre'ssion of vacillation and indecisiveness that many believe sometimes characterized his first year. This explains in part the strong reaction of Mr. Jordan and others in the White House to the critical news release that the advisory committee prepared and distributed in advance of its meeting with Mr. Carter last Friday afternoon. The practice of preparing such releases in advance is routine — White House reporters regularly receive them from groups going in to see Mr. Carter — but the tone of the four‐page release prepared by the advisory committee seemed more accusatory than most. As far as the President's aides were concerned, crossed the line between constructive criticism and provocation. Mrs. Abzug'rejected this characterization today. “It was critical, bet not accusatory,” she said. “We have a responsbility to tell the President when we disagree with him.” Written in the past tense as if the meeting had already occurred, the release stated that the committee had “warned” the President that his anti‐inflation program would pose additional burdens on women in increased unemployment, cutbacks in riocial programs and other areas. It also said that the committee had been “critical” of the President's proposal to increase the military budget and had asked Mr. Carter to appoint committee to investigate “military extravagance.” The release also “condemned” the President's long‐standing opposition to Medicaid‐financed abortions for the poor., It said that the committee had told the President that•it was its responsibility to “help sensitize this Administration and Congress to the realities of women's lives today.” The committee's duties have never been outlined in great,detail. Ostensibly, it was created to advise the President of the impact of his.policies on women, but Mrs. Abzug, a former Democratic Representative from Manhattan, and her supporters believe it also has an advocacy role to play on behalf of American women generally. The White House insists that it is a consultative group. Beyond these differing interpretations, there is an ideological gap between the Carter Administration and Mrs. Abzug and her followers that was striking at the Democratic miniconvention in Memphis last month. A majority of the 1,600 delegates there were politically active women, and their real enthusiasm was reserved for the bold social programs espoused by Senator Edward M. Kennedy rather than for the fiscal conservatism of Mr. Carter. Mr. Carter faces similar problems with black groups and with labor. He has taken steps to mend his fences with hoth in recent days, but the differences over social spending are fundamental and likely to erupt again as the debate on the 1980 budget intensifies. In private conversations, many feminist leaders here are frequently critical of Mr. Jordan: They see him as primarily responsible for the resignation of Margiiret Costanza. the President's first special assistant for women's affairs.  Her successor, Sarah Weddington, has developed a smooth working relationship with the senior White House staff and focused her attention on pockettxxik issues affecting women, such as Social Security and pension revisison rather than on such issues as abortion and the equal rights amendment.  Although she has avoided any public comment on Mrs. Abzug's dismissal, she is known to support the President's decision and is actively engaged in the search for new co‐chairmen of the committee."
Feminist Will Head Women's Panel,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/17/archives/feminist-will-head-womens-panel-2-members-back-two-who-will-stay.html,"WASHINGTON. Jan. 16 — The White House today selected Marjorie Bell Chambers, an active feminist who is national president of the American Association of University Women, to succeed Bella S. Abzug temporarily as head of the President's National Advisory Committee on Women. Sarah R. Weddington, President Carter's special assistant for women's affairs, said that Mrs. Chambers had accepted the position temporarily and would work with the White House to reconstitute the committee and define its responsibilities. Meanwhile, two of the 26 women who resigned from the committee in protest over the abrupt dismissal of Mrs. Abzug last Friday advised Miss Weddington that they would remain on the panel. Miss Weddington added that only four of the 26 announced resignations had so far been received and said there were indications that a number of the women were reconsidering their decision. Two Who Will Stay The two who said they would stay are Billie Masters, a member of the American Indian Women's Caucus, and Tin Myaing Thien, a leader of the Asian and Pacific Minority Women's Caucus. Neither was immediately available for comment. In New York City, Cy Chassler, editor of Redbook magazine who was one of three men on the committee, told a television interviewer that Miss Weddington had been calling members who resigned “to test whether or not we would join either this committee or a newly constituted one.” Mrs. Abzug, the former Democratic Representative from Manhattan, was dismissed by Mr. Carter after the advisory committee issued a press release critical of his policies before a meeting with the President at the White House. There are 40 members of the committee, which was estabished last year. Mrs. Chambers, a registered Republican who is a member of the City Council of Los Alamos, N.M., is described by associates as a “strong and committed feminist.” They add, however, that she is more low‐key and moderate in her views than the outspoken Mrs. Abzug. Mrs. Chambers could not be reached for comment in New Mexico, but an aide in the Washington office of the Association of University Women said that Mrs. Chambers had been distressed by the dismissal of Mrs. Abzug. “Marjorie resisted the emotional pull to resign in protest herself,” the aide said, “because she feels strongly that women must keep the door to the Administration open.” A former president of Colorado Women's College, Mrs. Chambers, 55 years old, has wide experience in education and the women's movement. Her associates report that although she has been active in fighting for improvements in the economic and legal status of women, she has generally stayed away from the more controversial issues, such as abortion and lesbian rights. She lobbied actively on Capitol Hill on behalf of an extension of the ratification time for the proposed equal rights amendment and has worked with Miss Weddington in an effort to win its adoption in state legislatures. Miss Weddingon stressed in an interview today that, despite recent reports to the contrary, she had devoted a major portion of her time in the White House to promoting the equal rights amendment and had made more than 45 speeches nationwide on its behalf in the last three months. In a related development, Phyllis Schafly, the national chairman of the STOP E.R.A. Movement, called on Mr. Carter today to either abolish the advisory committee “and save the taxpayers $300,000,” or include among the new members he must now appoint women opposed to the equal rights amendment. Mrs. Schlafly contended that the committee was in violation of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which requires such groups to be fairly balanced in the points of view of their members. Although the panel's members receive no salary, the Government provides $300,000 annually in expenses for its operations. Mrs. Abang Forecasts New Panel Mrs. Abzug said in New York yesterday that members of the advisory committee who resigned in protest of her ouster would join with other feminist leaders “to reconstitute” their own advisory committee. She made the statement in a television interview on WABC but did not elaborate on plans for the apparently ex officio panel."
Excerpts From Panel Statement,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/17/archives/excerpts-from-panel-statement.html,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 16 — Following are excerpts from the press release, issued on Friday by the National Advisory Committee for Women that led in part to President Carter's ouster of Bella S. Abzug as co‐chairman and to the ensuing controversy. In its first meeting today with President Carter, the National Advisory Committee for Women, fulfilling its mandate to advise him on initiatives promoting equality for women, warned that the Administration's anti‐inflation program will impose additional burdens upon women in increased unemployment, cutbacks, in social programs, postponement of comprehensive national health insurance and deferred action on programs addressing poverty and assistance to cities where the majority of women live. The committee also called for an accelerated White House effort to emphasize the importance of ratifying the Equal Rights Ammendment as a national priority. In a statement prepared for a meeting with the President today at 2:30 P.M. at the Cabinet Room of the White House, co‐chairs Bella Abzug and Carmen Delgado Votaw asked that the Presidentially appointed committee participate fully with the Administration in setting national priorities, developing public policy ana determining budget allocations. The committee was critical of the Administration's proposed 10 percent increase in the military budget and said that the recognition of China and the impending SALT agreement should lead to deceleration of the arms race. It asked the President to appoint a committee “to investigate military extravagance and make specific proposals for substantive cuts and cost saving.” The women leaders noted that in Dec. 20 meeting pith Stuart Eizenstat, the President's chief domestic policy adviser, he admitted that the Government has not “sensitized itself” to the “profound implications” of women's increased participation in the labor force and has been negligent in failing to develop a public policy on women's role in the changing economy. They pointed out that 49 percent of women are in the labor force and 90 percent work at some periods of their lives. The committee strongly condemned the continued Medicaid ban on abortion payments and urged the President to change his position on this issue and also to “take vigorous action” to restore the right to abortion services for military personnel, Peace Corps volunteers and their dependents."
Study Says Smoking Perils Baby Even If Halted Before Pregnancy,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/17/archives/study-says-smoking-perils-baby-even-if-halted-before-pregnancy.html,"HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C., Jan. 16 (AP) — New evidence indicates that the negative effects of smoking continue even if women quit before pregnancy, according to a major new study. Data released today for the United States Collaborative Perinatal Project, which examined more than 50,000 pregnancies at 12 hospil al centers, confirmed preVious studies showing that smoking during pregnancy increases disorders that kill the unborn and the newborn. Dr. Richard L. Naeye of Pennsylvania State University, head pathological scientist for the study, told the American Heart Association's annual science writers’ forum that he was particularly disturbed by the first data indicating that past smoking had an effect on later pregnancy. He said placenta praevia and the presence of abnormally large areas of dead tissue on the placenta were more common for smoking mothers and were related to past smoking, measured as cigarettes per year over a period of time. Placenta praevia is a condition in which the placenta is attached abnormally low in the womb, leading to dangerous complications during labor and birth. Duration Undetermined Dr. Naeye said it was no: determined how long the effects of smoking continue after a woman quits, but he advised women contemplating pregnancy to give up smoking as early as possible before conception. Previous studies linked sudden infant death syndrome, also called crib death, to smoking in pregnancy. But Dr. Naeye said that this study was the first to show smoking as an independent risk factor of the condition, a problem of unknown origin that kills one of every 400 children born in the United States. While smoking is not the greatest risk factor in crib death — premature birth and respiratory and prenatal infection are others — it alone increases the risk of crib death by 52 percent, Dr. Naeye said. Among the adverse effects that increase because of smoking in pregnancy are spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and premature births, the study confirmed. The study found that smoking increased the frequency of three other often‐fatal disorders: premature separation of the placenta (the sac in which the fetus grows) from the womb; Rh disease, a blood disorder; and malformations of the heart and other organs. Dr. Naeye said that the study disagreed with previous reports on the prena- tal effect of smoking on a child's intelligence. Several studies have reported that children of mothers who smoke have lower intelligence test scores than those of nonsmokers. But in comparing I.Q.'s of siblings whose mothers smoked in one pregnancy but not the other, the study found no difference. Dr. Naeye said. The project, financed by the National Institutes of Health, uses data gathered during pregnancy, birth and the postnatal period from 1959 to 1966. Much of the data are still being analyzed, and it will be years before all the results are in. Dr. Naeye said. Participating medical centers are: Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore; Columbia‐Presbyterian Medical Center, New York City; Metropolitan Hospital of New York Medical College, New York City; Boston Lying In Hospital; University of Oregon Medical School, Portland; Charity Hospital, New Orleans; Children's Hospital, Buffalo; Medical College of Virginia, Richmond; University of Minnesota Hospital, Minneapolis; Pennsylvania Hospital and Children's Hospital, of Philadelphia, considered as one unit in the study; Brown University Child Study Center, Providence; and Gailor Hospital of Memphis."
Soviet Tends Its Orphans Well but Is Wary on Adoption,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/18/archives/soviet-tends-its-orphans-well-but-is-wary-on-adoption-far-more.html,"MOSCOW, Jan. 17—The rooms at orphanage No. 23 are bright and spacious. the toys plentiful and well chosen. The adults who work there seem caring and warm. And still the children have hollow eyes. Longing gazes fasten onto every new grown‐up who walks briefly into this small world — the same searching pleading looks of silence once seen in the brutally squalid orphanages of Vietnam. Materially, there is no sense of deprivation in the three‐story building in northwestern Moscow that houses 180 children between the ages of 3 and 6. They are well clothed and well fed, rarely left idle, shepherded gently through the same program of play and learning that governs thousands of ordinary state-run kindergartens throughout the country. The difference is that when evening comes, no one picks them up and takes them home. That difference is in their eyes. The problem of orphaned, rejected, abandoned and abused youngsters is rarely publicized in the Soviet Union, but it is a problem nonetheless, one addressed by an elaborate governmental structure of adoption procedures, orphanages, boarding schools, family investigators and a fixture in every police precinct known as the children's room, where trained teachers, not policemen, try to cope with delinquency and battered or neglected children. Far More Extensive Problem The difficulties are sufficient to have produced an unusually candid documentary, shown last year in some movie houses, on small boys and girls running to the police for protection after being beaten by drunken parents. Ostensibly it was a film against alcohol ism, but in interviews with parents, children and state officials, the documentary made it clear that child abuse was a broader problem with deeper ca uses than heavy drinking. The extreme measure is for the courts to remove children from theirhomes — “deprivation of parents’rights” is the legal term — and, according to figures given by Anna I. Shishova, a Ministry of Education official responsible for child welfare, this happens 30 to 65 times a year in Moscow, city of 8 million. The youngsters may be returned home after a t ime. About a third of the 180 in orphanage No. 23 have been taken from their parents by the courts, explained the institution's director, Fira S. Dobrovetskaya ; another third were abandoned and the rest either have no living parents or were given up at birth by young unwed mothers. Moscow has 14 such orphanages, known by the euphemism children's homes, housing some 2,000 children, Mrs. Shishova said, as well as two boarding schools with 700 boys and girls aged 7 to 17. A further 6,000 orphans live with relatives. In New York City, which is about the same size as Moscow, the listing for foster families alone is 16,630 children. Adoptions are also fewer than in New York, 500 annually compared with a 1977 total of 1,483. The difference is attributed to both smaller number of available children and more stringent procedures. ‘Demand Exceeds Supply “Many people want to adopt,” said the director, a veteran of 20 years in orphanages who has grjandchildren of her own. “The demand vastly exceeds the supply.” Despite the demand, not many of her charges leave for families. The number was only about 20 last year, she said, figure that seems to reflect official reluctance to encourage adoptive parents to take older children. This attitude, in turn, results from a very strong axiom in the Soviet Union that the child must always believe that his adoptive parents are his natural ones — an illusion usually impossible to create for a child of 5 6. Mrs. DobrovetAaya has tried and succeeded with the younp,r ones. “Re- cently a small Ath:rel, corn,: up to me and asked , ‘Please find my mother!'” she related. “I told him I would try to find her. And later, when a couple came in looking for a child to adopt, Andrei came up and said, ‘My parents!’ “ They adopted him. Fostering the illusion is perhaps the greatest philosophical difference from the method of adoption in the United States, where social workers often advise couples to be honest with their adopted children, to bring them up understanding that they are adopted, to avoid the trauma of sudden discovery later in life. Here, the conviction that child cannot handle such knowledge emotionally is so firmly rooted that the law provides for three years’ imprisonment for anyone who divulges the truth to an adopted youngster before age IS. After that age, Mrs. Shishova maintained, a person is usually mature enough to adjust, providing there has been solid, loving family upbringing. Extraordinary Precautions Both government and individuals take extraordinary precautions to reduce the possibility of a breach. Birth certificates can be changed. Families often move to new neighborhoods, and the Education Ministry helps them exchange apartments to avoid old neighbors who might let the truth slip out. Yet there seems to be no feeling that adoption is always the best course for child, no sense of urgency about finding homes. Families are chosen with extreme care in a long process, with preference given to what Mrs. Shishova called full families — those with both husband and wife, and preferably grandparents as well. To be considered adoptable, children are screened so thoroughly that many are screened out. Physically handicapped and mentally retarded youngsters are housed separately and are prohibited by law from being offered for adoption except to close relatives. Outwardly normal children are examined physically, psychologically and genetically by special medical boards before being declared eligible. Both official philosophy and parental wishes combine to work against the adoption of older or disturbed children. “A sick child,” Mrs. Shishova declared a a statement that would provoke disagreement from many American profes- sionals, “cannot be better off in faintly than in an institution.” “Most parents don't want to adopt older children,” said Mariya N. Olisova, a child‐welfare investigator, “and if I hey do we recommend t hat they take a young child because they can watch how the child grows and develops.” Consequently, all but 5 percent of the children adopted in Moscow are under the age of 3, and most are infants handed over in maternity hospitals by very young “sinful girls,” as Mrs. Dobrovetskaya put it, who give birth despite free, legalized abortion. The adoptive mothers get the same maternity leave that natural mothers do. The room the children use during the day is big, with a play area and a set of desks. Through one door is a spacious bedroom with beds made up with crisp sheets; through another is a tiled dressing room for shedding winter clothes. There are plants and fish tanks and birds. The girls have close‐cropped hair, with big ribbons for a visitor's benefit; the boys have scrubbed faces. They do not reach out to touch you or hug you, but their eyes will not let you go. Mrs. Dobrovetskaya is proud of the work done at her institution. “The children do not seem to feel that they lack real love,” she said. “They become so used to the regime here that they do not feel the lack of parents. They call the nurses Mama, and they do not even know the difference.” It was a view expressed with a smile in her office at the start of a formal interview, and whatever its source, it evaporated after a walk among the staring children. “Maybe deep in the soul they develop some kind of sadness,” she conceded later. And she herself —does she ever go home at night in sadness? “Of course,” she answered quietly. “Every day of the week. It is a difficult mission. Sad. Sad. It is sad to see the mists in their eyes.”"
"Billy, Bella and Dick",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/18/archives/billy-bella-and-dick.html,"For some days each January, Washington goes into a kind of limbo. The Presidency is, in effect, at the printer. After weeks of internal warfare, the budget has been shaped and the initiatives, whether for heroic new programs or heroic cuts in old ones, have been swathed in rhetoric. Everyone is left waiting. Until the boxes of printed budget documents come back and the ritual messages on the State of the Union and the economy are delivered, there can be no useful discussion or argument. That season has obviously arrived. is signaled by what, in the absence of substance, students of the Presidency (that is, most people in Washington) are talking about:  We have little patience for Billy Carter's behavior, which has now crossed from bumptious to boorish. But that is hardly a subject of interesting disagreement, let alone weighty substance. By contrast, the President's firing of Bella Abzug as head of an advisory committee on women has provoked disagreement, even controversy. The manner her dismissal seemed clumsy but it is hard to get exercised over the discovery that Presidents dislike public criticism from their own appointees. In any event, what issue of substance is involved? Was Mr. Carter proposing to be any less committed to the Equal Rights Amendment, or any more committed to abortion rights? There may be cuts in the coming budget that women's groups will find painful. If so, lobbying against them while the budget is still at the printer seems more adversary than advisory. There is a long Congressional season ahead for opposition. The third subject, guess who's coming to dinner, involves both hot controversy and real substance. Some people are sputtering mad that Richard Nixon, who left the White House in such disgrace, should asked to return in circumstances of such ceremony: the Jan. 29 state dinner for China's top man. “It is degrading to the office of the President, sneering at the American people's desire for integrity in government and a sordid political ploy,” said Representative Elizabeth Holtzman of Brooklyn. There is indeed something troubling appearances; The social penalty for Presidential betrayal of public trust should not provide for time off for good behavior. Still, Mr. Nixon's sins do not vitiate his genuine accomplishments, of which the opening to China 1971‐72 was probably the highest.  The likelihood, though, is that these considerations had little to do with the invitation. Mr. Carter may have had no choice. Teng Hsiao‐ping wanted to see Richard Nixon somewhere. Better, from Mr. Carter's perspective, in the White House than in San Clemente. And who knows, what Miss Holtzman called “a sordid political ploy” might in fact have constructive political value. His disgrace notwithstanding, Richard Nixon's views on formal relations with Peking or an arms treaty with Moscow could, for many citizens, lend credence to President Carter's goals. Hence the invitation might well be political without being all that sordid. Paris in 1593 was worth a Mass, China in 1979 is surely worth an extra place at dinner."
White House Fails to Mend Fences With Key Women's Groups,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/20/archives/white-house-fails-to-mend-fences-with-key-womens-groups-a-rubber.html,"A week atter the so‐called Friday Night Massacre in which Bella Abzug got a pink slip from the White House, the scorecard on the National Advisory Committee for Women read: 15 mem- bers on, 25 members off. But those numbers could change, the game being far from over. For days now, committee members who re- signed to protest President Carter's dismissal of their co‐chairman have been getting telephone calls from his special assistant on women, Sarah Weddington, urging them to serve on a reconstituted committee. By week's end, however, only two had agreed to return, one of them for what she termed “a trial period.” “As long as my constituency wants me to work within the system, I will’ give it one more try,” explained Tin Myaing Their, a leader of the Asian and Pacific Minority Women's Caucus. “But if I go back and things are still the same, then I will stop wasting my time.” Speaking for the American Indian Women's Caucus, Billie Nave Masters, the other returning member, 'summed up its message to the WhiteHHouse: “We don't like what you did, but we're still here and you're going to have to deal with us and try to work this out.” Their remarks reflect the conflicting feelings of many named to the 40-member committee, which was established last April by Mr. Carter to advise him on implementing the 26‐point National Plan of Action that emerged from the historic National Women's Conference in Houston in 1977. Feminist hopes were high then. 'A R'bber Stamp’ Now, however, leaders of some of the country's, largest and most powerful women's organizations have followed Mrs. Abzug out of the White House. They include representatives of the National Organization for Women, the League of Women Voters, the National Women's Political Caucus, the Coalition of Labor Union Women, the National Association.of Business and Professional Women. In their minds the committee has become “a rubber stamp,” as many put it. Not all members agree with that characterization, but they are solid on one point. A poll of 35 of the members suggests the overwhelming majority were disturbed by the way the White House treated Bella Abzug. Whether they chose to stay or to resign from the committee, whether they approved or disapproved of their co‐chairman's confrontational style, the consensus was, as one woman put it, that “Bella deserved better.” No one quarreled with Mr. Carter's right to replace the former Representative from New York. In fact, a few members agreed with his decision. “The committee was not happy with Bella's leadership,” Gretta Dewald, director of the women's division of the Democratic National Committee, said. “It was inevitable thdt she would go eventually.” What disturbed the members of Mrs. Abzug's committee was the manner of her dismissal. There she was at an Oval Room press conference on the committee's first meeting with Mr. Carter (during which White House aides say she “lectured” him and she says he “scolded” the committee). Whatever their differences, Mrs. Abzug was “talking nice” about the President to the press, when she was handed a note to report to the office of his top aide, Hamilton Jordan, where she was told to resign immediately or be fired. ‘Shabby and Humiliating’ “1 was horrified by the way the resignation was handled,” declared Mary Helen Madden, executive director of the National Council of Catholic Women. Maxine Waters, Democratic majority whip of the California State Legislature, called the incident “shabby and humiliating.” “It was very disturbing,” said Brenda Parker, a 19-year-old college student who heads the Future Homemakers of America. Several women spoke of the “double standard” used by the White House in its handling of the resignations of Dr. Peter Bourne, Special Assistant for Health Affairs, and Bert Lance, Director of the Office of Budget and Management. “They don't treat men the way they do women,” said Mary Crisp, cochairman of the Republican National Committee. “Those men were heartless and brutal to Bella. It abridged any sense of dignity.” Even Marjorie Bell Chambers, who has agreed to serve as temporary head of a reconstituted committee, could not defend the treatment of Mrs. Abzug, in her words, “a prime leader of the women's movement.” “It was awkward to give it to her right there when she had gone outside to the press and told them how well the meeting had gone and how we were looking forward to more contact with the White House,” admitted Mrs. Chambers, president of the American Association of University Women. “The timing was unfortunate.” At the same time, she and others still on the committee expressed the hope that others would return. “Emotions are running high right now and I recognize that,” said Mrs. Chambers, adding that her chief concern was that the committee be made up of feminists. “The opposition is already attacking the membership of the committee,” she said, referring to demands by Phyllis Schlafly, head of the nationwide Stop E. R. A. forces, that women against the equal rights amendment be named to the committee. Despite these warnings, there is no indication that leaders of major women's organizations will reconsider any time soon. As Ellie Smeal, president of NOW, said: “These were reflective decisions. Most of the members acted after consulting with their boards and executive committees. We treated these decisions with great seriousness.” Resigning members do not feel that the White House treated the committee with equal seriousness. In criticizing the Administration's budget plans, Mrs. Abzug was speaking for the committee, they say. “Bella Abzug was used as a scapegoat to suppress our independence,” said Mildred Jeffrey, president of the National Women's Political Caucus. Nancy Neuman, vice president of the League of Women Voters, said: “When you set up a committee of that size, you automatically set up an adversary relationship. An advisory committee can't always be positive. That's built into the process.” Far from positive, the committee issued a press release critical of the Carter Administration's anti‐inflation program before meeting with the President. Bella Abzug, who denied responsibility for the release, said the fundamental dispute was that the committee was attempting to deal with issues beyond those clearly labeled “women's work.” Cites Broader Issues “That's what got us into trouble and that's all that got us into trouble,” Mrs. Abzug insisted. “We're supposed to stay in our little corner, a very important corner for us, and talk about the equal rights amendment and abortion. What they don't understand is the economy is a women's issue and foreign policy is a women's issue.” Said Ellie Smeal: “We represent half the population. To criticize us for dealing with the defense budget or the budget in general by saying that's not the domain of women's rights is just a parochial attitude. Let's face it, a lot of cuts in the current budget will hurt women. Are we to close our eyes to social security cuts, for example? Proportionately, these cuts will effect drastically more elderly women than men.” The irony, in the view of many resigning members, is that Mr. Carter may well enjoy a better relationship with a reconstituted committee because of his confrontation with the original one. As Jill Ruckelshaus, who headed President Ford's advisory committee for women and who has resigned from Mr. Carter's committee, put it: “They'll have a clearer expectation of what can be achieved and having that will probably make it easier for them.”"
The Pope's Visit to Mexico,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/20/archives/the-popes-visit-to-mexico-government-trying-to-smooth-way-this.html,"PUEBLA,. Mexico, Jan. 19 - The planned visit of Pope John Paul II to Mexico Jan. 26‐30 is awakening long‐dormant religious passions that could disturb the delicate balance of power that has existed between church and state for 90 years. Officially, Pope John Paul is coming to Puebla to open the third Latin American Bishops’ Conference. The mere announcement of the trip has revived debate over the role of the Roman Catholic Church in Mexican society and has aroused latent anticlericalism in official circles. Political groups of left and right have either welcomed or condemned the visit, while the Minister of the Interior, Jesus Reyes Heroles, has said, “We are confident that the visit will neither create nor provide an excuse for the revival of old and painful conflicts that have long been overcome.” It is inescapably ironical that the Pope, on his first trip abroad since being elected, should visit the only Latin American country that does not maintain diplomatic relations with the Vatican. Further, this is a country where the church was brutally persecuted in the 1920's and 30's as a result of its active opposition to the 1910 revolution. While the power of the church is strictly limited by the Constitution and it steers clear of open involvement in politics, over 90 percent of the 65 million Mexicans are formally Catholic, so bishops and priests still exercise considerable influence. Awareness of the continuing political potential of the church is at the heart of the nervousness in governmental circles. Some members of the Government have privately criticized President Jose Lopez Portillo for not discouraging the Pope from coming. “You have to remember the high price we paid for the separation of church and state,” said a young official who was himself baptized. “It's chapter of our history that we don't want to reopen.” Mr. Lopez Portillo responded: “We have confidence in our institutions. We do not fear outside contamination. For that reason we can confront any contact with respect, pride and dignity.” The church's role in Mexico began at the moment of the conquest of the Aztecs by Hernando Cortes and his Spanish conquistadors in 1521. At first missionaries showed enlightenment, protecting the Indians from slavery and exploitation. But, in time, the church became increasingly wealthy and conservative and introduced the inquisition to its largest colony in the New World. When Mexico won independence from Spain in 1821, the church owned half the land. Its influence over the army and the wealthy elite enabled it to break many of the governments that emerged over the next 35 years. A simmering conflict between prochurch conservatives and anticlerical liberals finally erupted in civil war in the mid‐19th century. In the 1850's President Benito Juarez ordered the confiscation of church lands and appeared to break the political power of the hierarchy for the first time in 350 years. Yet the church recovered its influence and even some of its property during the long dictatorship of Gen. Porfirio Diaz, and by time the revolution erupted in 1910, the church was once again closely allied with the landed classes. The deep hostility felt by the victorious revolutionaries toward the church was evidenced in the still‐valid 1917 Constitution, which excludes it from the educational system, declares all church buildings to belong to the state, prohibits foreigners from serving as priests, prohibits priests and nuns from appearing in their habits otitside their churches and establishes penalties for church involvement When these provisions were applied by President Plutarco Elias Calles in 1926, the church responded by striking for three years, closing schools and not conducting services. The church also condoned an uprising of young religious fanatics known as Cristeros who attacked schools and other public property to the cry of “Long live Christ the King!” The response was fierce, with the army sent to wipe out the Cristeros and priests subjected to a wave of persecution that lasted well into the 30's. Hundreds of priests were killed or forced to flee, while those who remained, numbering fewer than 100 in 1935, would frequently say mass in hiding. Only in 1990, when President Manuel Avila Camacho declared that he was a believer, did some reconciliation take place between church and state. The church accepted its exclusion from politics, while the state became more tolerant of minor violations of the Constitution, such as the return of priests to private schools and the formation of an openly prochurch opposition group, the National Action Party. In recent years church and state have come to respect each other's spheres of influence. The hierarchy has quietly accepted the Government's family-planning program on the understanding that abortion will not be legalized. Similarly, President Luis Echeverria Alvarez visited Pope Paul VI in Rome in 1979 although the open anticlericalism of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party prevented him from formalizing ties with the Vatican. Throughout the political ups and downs most Mexicans have remained devout, their expressions of faith frequently echoing the pagan rituals that survived the Spanish Conquest. These people are expected to turn out in the hundreds of thousands to welcome the Pope, not only in Mexico City, where he will visit the shrine of the “Indian” Virgin of Guadalupe, and in Puebla, which is 65 miles southeast of the capital, where he will attend the bishops’ conference, but also in the Indian region of Oaxaca, in the far south, and conservative city of Guadalajara, 290 miles northwest of the capital. The Government, somewhat reluctantly, has come to terms with the visit, and last week the Pope thanked the authorities for “their comprehension and benevolent attitude.” Because no official invitation has been issued, the Pontiff will be “a distinguished visitor,” but the Government will provide him with security. He is expected to meet privately with President Lopez Portillo, who will supply him an official aircraft. John Paul's violations of the Constitution — wearing his robes in public and, being a foreigner, saying mass —will be ignored."
Constitution‐Changing,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/20/archives/constitutionchanging.html,"It's 1979 — Do you know where your Constitution is? You probably do know that Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California has asked that Congress call a national constitutional convention to adopt an amendment to the Federal Constitution requiring a balanced Federal budget and that Senator Edward M. Kennedy has opposed this suggestion, which the National Taxpayers Union says has already been acted upon by over 20 states. But did you know that a number of states have also called on Congress to convene a constitutional convention on a variety of other issues and that 13 states — 10 states within the last two years — have already requested Congress to hold such a convention on the subject of abortion? Or that in other states, including New York, such a resolution on abortion has already passed one house of the Legislature? The United State Constitution, adopted in 1787, has stood up well. But if a stop is not put to the constitutionalconvention resolutions that increasingly threaten it, it may not survive to reach its 200th birthday. Although proponents of a convention on a particular subject appear, on the surface, to be calling for a convention concerned just with that subject, almost all of the lawyers and historians who have studied the question have held that no one can predict with any certainty that if a convention were held on any one subject, it might not decide to change the Constitution in other substantial respects as well. If delegates were so inclined, they might try to amend the Constitution to permit segregation, to change the one‐man one‐vote rule, to end the constitutional mandate of separation of church and state, to reject the guarantees of free speech and free press, to repeal the prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures. The first and only Constitutional Convention was called for the purpose of amending the Articles of Confederation. Finding those Articles a woefully inadequate document to govern our new nation, the Founding Fathers disregarded the purpose for which they were assembled and proceeded to draft our Constitution, which was subsequently adopted by the states. That Constitution has weathered the almost 200 years of its existence startlingly well, and is still proving to be a model for constitutions adopted by other countries. Few people are aware that Article 5 provides that it can be amended in either of two ways since only one of these has ever been used. The procedure by which all our amendments have been adopted has been an evolutionary one: two‐thirds of Congress has proposed them and three‐quarters of the states have ratified them. The alternative method — never used — and referred to by Senator Kennedy as “a darker side to the amendment process” — empowers two‐thirds of the states to pass resolutions asking Congress to call a constitutional convention for the purpose of proposing amendments. If two‐thirds of the state legislatures pass such a resolution (it is not at all clear whether the governor has to approve) Congress must call a convention, and the outcome of the convention must be ratified by three‐quarters of the state. Although many questions immediately arise in connection with the possible holding of such a convention, there is no definitive answer to any of them. Some of the more important ones are: Would the convention be limited to the purpose or purposes of which it was called? Would the courts have the right to decide any issues that may arise? What would be the method of selecting delegates? What would they vote on and what vote would carry — a majority? two‐thirds? three‐quarters? Unanimous? What if the delegates proposed something that would be inconsistent with other parts of the Constitution that they are not amending? On occasion, individual Senators and Congressmen have proposed a set of rules to govern a possible constitutional convention. The most recent rules suggested would divest the courts of any right to decide anything with respect to the convention or its outcome and specify also that a governor's signature is not necessary if a state legislature asks Congress to call a convention. These rules would give all powers to the legislatures; neither the courts nor the executive departments — the President, governors would have anything to say. Moreover, no set of rules presented by one Congress would necessarily be binding on either the convention or the next Congress. The jeopardy to all our basic liberties which a constitutional convention would entail is great. One of the frightening things about these pressures for a convention that have been increasing each of the last few years is that so few people know about them. On the whole, it is not a subject of public discussion, studies or even notice. Surely all Americans who value our hard‐won basic freedoms and recognize the evolutionary process by which they have developed will not want to put them at the mercy of an uncharted and possibly uncontrollable convention, no matter what their views on abortion or a balanced Federal budget may be.

New Abortion‐Law Proposal Sets Stage for Confrontation,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/21/archives/new-jersey-weekly-new-abortionlaw-proposal-sets-stage-for.html,"TRENTON THE continuing controversy over New Jersey's abortion laws is expected to enter a new and possibly bitterly fought stage here tomorrow. Several legisla- tors are proposing one of the strictest abortion laws in the nation, and groups whose position is that a woman alone has the right to decide whether she shall have an abortion plan to descend on Trenton in force to fight the proposal. If they could, many legislators would outlaw abortions almost entirely. But the sponsors of the new bill, which is likely to pass, recognize that the long- standing policy of the state — to protect the right to life of an unborn child from the time of its conception by prohibiting abortion, unless it is deemed necessary to save the life of the mother flies in the face of recent decisions by the Supreme Court of the United States. Efforts to ‘prohibit or severely limit abortions in New Jersey have kept the Legislature and pro‐choice groups at odds for several years. As fast as the courts have struck down a state abortion law, the Legislature has come up with a new one. The latest measure, which prohibits the use of state tax funds to pay for Medicaid‐financed abortions, was struck down on Jan. 10 by Judge David D. Furman in State Superior Court. He found that the law discriminated against poor women, giving the right to an abortion only to those able to afford the cost. “It's absolute nonsense for the Legislature to be involved in trying to regulate abortions,” said Fran Avalone, coordinator of Right to Choose, the state's most active pro‐choice group. “The Legislature should be requiring contraceptive and sex education in the schools so that many of these women won't get pregnant.” Mrs. Avalone said that she also objected to being referred to as a proabortionist. “As the name of our organization implies, we are for the right of women to choose,” she declared. The proposed new abortion law — it was sponsored in the Legislature by Assemblyman Thomas J. Deverin of Carteret and Senator Joseph A. Maressa of Atco, both Democrats — is unconstitutional, Mrs. Avalone said. “All those laws are,” she added. The Deverin‐Maressa bill was voted out of committee last Tuesday, but has not yet been scheduled for a vote by the Assembly. It would do the following:  Require that parents or guardians of unmarried girls under 18 be notified when such a girl seeks an abortion.  Prohibit abortions by saline solution. Prohibit abortions if the fetus is viable, except when necessary to save the life of the mother, and in those instances require physicians to take every step to keep the baby alive. (The mother of such a baby would have no claim to it, nor would the father if he agreed to the abortion. The baby would become a ward of the state.) Require women to sign forms, before undergoing an abortion, that they had been warned of and understood the possible physical and psychological perils. Mrs. Avalone said that she and most others who favored the, right of free Continued on Page 18 choice supported the last requirement of the Deverin‐Maressa bill. “We think women should be informed,” she asserted. A bill to accomplish this — it was introduced by Assemblywoman Mildred Barry Garvin, Democrat of East Orange - is also pending in the Legislature. The law ruled unconstitutional by Judge Furman on Jan. 10 was passed in 1975, but had been in effect only since August 1977. Before it became effective, 10,000 of the estimated 40,000 annual ‘abortions in the state were paid for under Medicaid at a cost of about $20 million a year. Judge Furman's ruling that enforcement of this law discriminated against women who could not afford the cost of at least $300 for private abortions followed a suggestion from the State Supreme Court that such edicts might violate the State Constitution, even though the Supreme Court of the United States had ruled that the New.Jersey measure was legal under the Federal Constitution. Morris Pashman, a member of the State Supreme Court, ruled last year that the New Jersey Constitution probably provided stronger “equal rights” protection than did the Federal Constitution. Chief Justice Richard J. Hughes of the State Supreme Court refused last June to set aside an earlier order by Judge Furman that the state Medicaid program must pay for an abortion for 24-year-old Newark woman who said she feared psychological damage if forced to give birth to an unwanted child. Attorneys for the state have not yet decided Whether to appeal Judge Furman's ruling, but a spokesman for the Right to Life Committee, one of the largest and most militant antiabortion groups and a party to the suit, said it would appeal if the state did not. If Judge Furman's ruling is allowed to stand, Medicaid abortions in the state are expected to increase from about 10 a month to 1,000 or so, adding about $20 million to state welfare costs. Under Federal regulations, no Federal aid may be used to help pay for abortions, but states are free to provide their own assistance. Chief Justice Hughes said that the real question in the Medicaid controversy did not involve money. The Legislature was not trying to save money when it passed the anti-Medicaid abortion bill, he said. Rather, he asserted, it was addressing “the moral issue of the state paying for something so many people think is wrong.”"
State G.O.P. Does Some Soul Searching,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/21/archives/new-jersey-weekly-state-gop-does-some-soul-searching-news-analysis.html,"THE state's Republican Party recently completed the “soul searching” that was forced upon it by the election losses incurred in the 1977 gubernatorial and 1978 United States Senate races. A “task force,” or committee, that was assigned to take the political pulse of the state and find out why the G.O.P. was losing both votes and members has filed its report. While many of the conclusions are obvious and could have been reached before a series of five “town hall” meetings was held last year, the report sets down both the problems and challenges in clear language. For example, some members of minority and ethnic groups told the task force - it was headed by Franklin V. Fischer, a state committeeman from Ocean County - that they were tired of being taken for granted by the Democratic Party and written off by the G.O.P. “Minorities and ethnics expressed the realization that, as long as they remain the sole and unwavering posses- sion of one political party, they will diminish their own chances of political and social gains,” the task force report said. It also was brought to the committee's attention that Republicans tended to have a rather narrow definition of the words “ethnics” and “minorities,” interpreting “ethnics” to mean Hispanics and “minorities” to mean blacks. “New Jersey is richly blessed with great diversity of ethnics and minorities, each with their own needs, interests and unique characteristics,” the task force reported. “If we continue to treat them as one or two groups, we run the risk of not only never expanding our base to include all those who are presently alienated from us, but also offending and losing those with whom we already have a positive relationship.” A majority of the young people who appeared before the task force already were actively involved in Republican politics and were not as interested in being part of the decision‐making process right away. Instead, they asked to be involved in the structural and fuhctional aspects of the party, move they believe will provide them with an educational experience. They also stressed the conviction that the recruitment of new Republicans should begin at an early age. “Statistical material proves that the first few votes cast by an American will establish a life‐long preference in better than 50 percent of all voters,” the task force report went on. “In essence, this simple suggestion of early‐age recruitment could possibly be the best hope for the mid- and long‐range success of the Republican Party.” The interest of the majority of the women who appeared before the task force centered on the pro‐abortion, anti‐abortion and Equal Rights Amendment movements, but they urged the G.O.P. fact‐finders not to believe that politically active women had no other interests. “At the present time, women's groups in the state have no solid idea where we Republicans stand on most issues,” the task force said. “This lack of understanding was heightened by the fact that, in 1977, we produced state Republican Party platform that did not include a specific section on women.” Organizational Republicans — those party members either appointed or elected to office — stressed “the absolute necessity for a political party to remember that its ultimate goal is to elect people to public office,” the task force said, “but, unfortunately, our party invariably seems to forget.” Among the 10 basic recommendations that the task force forwarded to David F. Norcross, the state Republican chairman, was one that said that the G.O.P. must become more active in the social and cultural activities in the various ethnic and minority communities in New Jersey. Other recommendations included one calling for a better relationship with the press and another that said that the party must attempt to restructure its image “by gearing our concerns to the bread-and-butter issues which face the people today and expressing these concerns in a clear and honest style.”"

Practices of Cults Receiving New Scrutiny,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/21/archives/practices-of-cults-receiving-new-scrutiny-cults-in-america-first-of.html,"Some have been highly visible in airports and on street corners, offering flowers and soliciting donations, but until 914 people died in Jonestown, Guyana, most of the thousands of Americans who have joined religious cults in the last dec- ade remained in the nation's peripheral vision. The following article is based on reporting by Jo Thomas and Nathiniel Sheppard Jr. It was written by Miss Thomas. There were groups that were considered odd, such as the Bo and Peep U.F.O. cult or New York's carpet‐cleaning cult. And some practices seemed strange, such as the mass marriages arranged by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon. As religious groups, however, cults were protected by the First Amendment and by a general feeling that their aura of good intentions might at worst cloak fraud. Then, last November. the People's Temple collapsed on itself with a violence that raised fundamental questions about how the nation could deal with religious groups that wooed the young and the idealistic, persuading them to give up their possessions, their family ties, their freedom and at Jonestown, their lives. Webster's New International I)ictionary, Second Edition, does not distinraish between a cult and a religious sect, but it does note that any religion regarded us unorthodox or spurious might be called a cult. Groups that find themselves de- scribed by outsiders as cults usually ???? ject to that designation. Interviews conducted across the country with leaders and current and former members of groups commonly described as cults, as well as with relatives of the members and with persons who have studied cults, show that the groups share at least some of the following character- istics: They have a living charismatic leader who says he has been given new, exclu- sive revelations about God or reality. Anyone who does not believe his teach- ings, he says, is not only wrong but also satanic. The leader creates a family, often a communal living arrangement, and takes a name such as “Dad.” Members fre- quently take new names when they join and sever ties with their real families. The leader sets absolute rules, but he does not necessarily obey them himself. He usually lives far more luxuriously than his followers. The group has an apocalyptic view of the world, in which moral rules may be discarded in the service of the leader. Members also discard their belongings, their occupations and, occasionally, their regard for their own physical well‐being. Certain behavior‐control techniques are practiced, usually in a setting iso- lated from the outside world. Members see the techniques as a religious regimen. Outsiders call them brainwashing. Although the Carter Administration op- poses any broad investigation of such groups on constitutional grounds, some members of Congress favor inquiries into their activities abroad and into the tax- exempt status they frequently have at home. Even before the bizarre episode in Guyana, there had been troubling signs. The complaints came first from parents who said their children had been brainwashed, a charge echoed by former members of some cults. The complaints were denied by the cults and many were virtually,impossible to prove in court. A wave of kidnappings by parents ensued, and a new profession appeared— “deprogramming,” a way of erasing religious indoctrination. There were reports that the Children of God had started practicing prostitution and that Synanon had changed from a group treating drug addiction into a cult that ordered mass divorces and vasectomies, abortions and beatings, and that it threatened those who tried to challenge it or to report on its activities. Paul Morantz, a lawyer who had successfully sued Synanon on behalf of a couple who charged brainwashing, kidnapping and false imprisonment, was bitten by a rattlesnake placed in his mailbox. The rattlesnake attack resulted in charges of attempted murder against Synanon's founder, Charles Dederich. The Federal Bureau of Investigation raided the Church of Scientology, charg- ing that church representatives had infil- trated Federal agencies and placed elec- tronic bugs in offices of the Internal Revenue Service. The raids yielded guns, dossiers on the church's enemies, lock- picking and bugging equipment, and such items as a blackjack and a vial labeled “vampire blood.” The House Subcommittee on Interna- tional Relations, concluding an eight- month study of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church, said it had found evidence that the organization had systematically violated Federal laws on taxes, immigration, banking, currency transactions and foreign‐agent registra- tion, as well as state and local jaws relat- ing to charity fraud. The People's Temple was an extreme example of the cults that have flourished in the United States in the 1970's as goals of the drug culture of the 1960's - escape, truth, community, rapture - were recon- stituted in the names of all sorts of proph- ets, messiahs and religions. Estimates of the number of Americans who belong to cults range from 300,000 to 3 million, depending on who is counting. The Church of Scientology claims a world membership of 5A million. The Unification Church and lesser‐known cults, such as The Way Interfiational, draw thousands. The Love Family is so small - about 250 - that members can all take the same last name. The Druids, a group that supplied a hotel in Gallup, N.M., with most of its workers, had fewer than 40 members. “I don't know what a cult is,” Attorney General Griffin B. Bell told an audience in Los Angeles early in December. “I am a member of the Baptist Church. I sup- pose I am in a cult “ The backgrounds of cult leaders are di- verse. In recent years, cults have been started by an airline pilot, an engineer, a country‐western singer and a real estate salesman, as well as by ministers of es- tablished churches. Bo and Peep, who formed a cult in 1973 based on their prophecy that they would be assassinated, return kom the dead and leave the planet in a craft from outer space, were Marshall Herff Applewhite, 47 years old, a musician and opera singer, and Bonnie Lu Trousdale Nettles, 51, a professional nurse. According to Robert Balch, a sociolo- gist at the University of Montana who studied the group for several years, Bo and Peep videotaped their “final state- ment to the earth,” left it in Oklahoma and disappeared, along with 96 followers. Mr. Balch believes the group has dimin- ished to about 60 to 75 members, organ- ized in three “families.” Ben Sebastian Sapio, 49, who founded a fundamentalist Bible cult called The Way, The Truth and The Life, was a hairdresser. In 1975, his group asked to sponsor 11 Vietnamese refugees, all Buddhists, at a commune in North Carolina. The refugees spent a month with the group, and left after complaints about their treatment were made to Senator Jesse A. Helms, Republican of North Carolina. The refugees said through an interpreter that they had been worked hard by day, indoctrinated by night in English they did not understand, and prevented from leaving. Some said the ex perience had led them to consider suicide. Mr. Sapio and other leaders of the group announced last year that they were leaving North Carolina. Their whereabouts are unknown. Stewart Traill, 43, a former vacuum cleaner salesman who teaches that the Bible was written in code, founded a group in Pennsylvania called the Forever Family. After opposition arose from groups of parents of members, the group changed its name to the Church of Bible Understanding and moved to New York City, where members stand on street corners soliciting business for the cult's carpet‐cleaning company. The group also has a mission in Haiti. Who is likely to join a cult? Prof.. Ronald Enroth, a sociologist at Westmont College in California and the author of a book about cults, said in an interview that a typical cult member is 18 to 22 years old, white, middle or upper‐middle class, and has at least some college education and a nominally religious upbringing. Shari Smith, now 25, was a lonely 19- year‐old freshman at the University of Wisconsin when she struck up a friend- ship with an older girl who was a member of The Body of Christ, a group founded by Sam Fife, a minister from Miami, and C.E. Cobb, an airline pilot. Miss Smith joined The Body - for “a sense of security, friendship,” she said and was sent in January 1973 to a farm it owned near Eupora, Miss:The Body also had wilderness settlements in South America, Canada and Alaska, and a fleet of airplanes to reach them. “A big thing with this group is demons - people are possessed,” she said. “By hurting the flesh, you can make the spirit overcome the devil. They beat on me be- cause I sassed.” She described their methods this way: “They tell you to kneel and put your hands on a chair, and then they take a wooden paddle and whip you a few times. three times it you're lucky. The first time, I got three. Other times, I don't remember. “Rebellious people were tied to a bed or chair or on the floor. They put a headset on them and played preachers from the group. The length depended on how long they fought it. One day or two days. They would also throw people in cold showers for running away. They would throw you in with your clothes on and keep you until you hollered ‘Jesus!’ loud enough. Miss Smith said the longest shower she was ever given lasted four and a half hours. She said that she stayed at the farm until September 1974, then went to live with Mr. and Mrs. Cobb, where, she said, she was told “not to tell what happened at the farm.” In December 1976, on a visit to her parents, Miss Smith said, she was persuaded during a deprogramming ses- sion to leave the cult. Neither Mr. Fife nor Mr. Cobb could be reached for comment. In most cases, conversions to cults in- volve no coercive measures, and law en- forcement officials therefore are gener- ally reluctant to intervene. But some cults, usually small ones, have run into trouble with the law over matters con- cerning their beliefs about health, diet or keeping dead bodies around for a resur- rection. Raymond Alvin Archer, 29, who sold produce and is the founder of the Theocratic Commune Natural Health Service, was charged last summer with manslaughter after the bodies of his 1-yearold son and 3-year-old daughter were found buried in the commune's yard on Detroit's East Side. A former cult member told the authorities that the group advocated a strict diet of raw fruits and vegetables and that the children were not given meat or dairy products. A medical examiner testified that he believed the girl had died of malnutrition. The cause of the boy's death could not be determined in an autopsy. In rural North Webster, Ind., Melvin Greider, a 42-year-old farmer, and Ho- bart Freeman, a theologian, founded the Glory Barn Faith Assembly, which did not believe in doctors. The group at- tracted 1,000 followers and was the object of public outrage over the deaths in child- birth, between 1975 and 1978, of two moth- ers and seven infants. One woman bled to death over a period of two days in the presence of a registered nurse. According to the local authorities, the nurse explained that she was in at- tendance only as a friend. No charges were ever brought against the Glory Barn. Mr. Freeman could not be reached for comment. Mr. Greider parted ways with the group early last year, because, his wife said, it was following Mr. Freeman more than Jesus. Mr. Greider is planning to build underground houses to survive the final days of the planet, in which the major credit‐card companies will al- legedly put a laser mark on everyone's left hand. In New York, Oric Boyar, a 59-year-old former opera coach who asserted that he was Christ, was found praying over the decomposing body of a follower who had died of cancer and was charged with fail- ing to report a corpse. On April 14, 1977, the day he was to stand trial, he jumped from a 10th‐floor window and killed him- self. He had once said, according to some reports, that if he jumped out a window, God would bounce him back."
The New Pope Comes to Confer With a Latin Church Militant,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/21/archives/the-new-pope-comes-to-confer-with-a-latin-church-militant.html,"MEXICO CITY — On his first trip abroad since becoming pontiff, Pope John Paul II will arrive in Mexico this week on a delicate mission - to forestall an open rift between the conservative and progressive wings of Latin America's Roman Catholic Church. By coming to inaugurate the third Latin American Bishops' Conference in Puebla, the Pope gets an opportunity to define the role of the church in society and assert his personal authority over the region's 300 million Catholics. His decision to go to Mexico reflects the gravity of the situation in a continent that will soon have half the world's Catholics. Since 1968, the Latin American church has become deeply involved inpolitics, and progressive priests are rebelling against the traditional discipline of their bishops. Pope John Paul's experience in Communist Poland, where the basic Issue is religious freedom in a Marxist state, may be of little help to him in understanding Latin America's forinally Catholic societies. Perennial controversies over birth control, abortion and divorce lose relevance in a region gripped by the struggle for a new society. The Catholic Church in Latin America has been historically identified with the landed classes and ruling elites, accumulating wealth, opposing social and economic reform. This conservatism led to empty churches and a declining priesthood. When political consciousness began spreading in the early 1960's, the Catholic hierarchies had lost touch with much of the laity. The bishops' organization, formed in Rio de Janeiro in 1955, took no significant action at that first meeting. In 1968, encouraged by the recommendations of the Second Vatican Council, the second Latin American Bish‐. ops' Conference in Medellin, Colombia, formally put the church on the side of the poor and oppressed. The revolutionary document was the work of progressive hishons, but conservatives accepted it and Pope Paul VI endorsed it. Guided by this “theology of liberation,” some churchmen first identified with the poor, then began defending human rights, and finally turned to outright advocacy of sweeping reform, even revolution. The impetus came from priests whose work‐with unemployed slumdwellers, landless peasants and impoverished Indians convinced them of the need for social change. As they helped organize trade unions and peasant movements, they became the targets of powerful landowners and rightvring generals. Some responded by joining armed leftist groups, proclaiming both Socialism and Christianity. Father Camilo Torres, a Colombian killed in combat in 1968, established the image of the guerrillapriest. Others followed his example. El Salvador's military regime claims that Father Ernesto Barrera Motto, killed last November, belonged to the Popular Forces of Liberation. In December, Father Gaspar Garcia Laviana died while fighting with Nicaragua's Sandinist guerrillas. The murder, arrest, for :rc or ex Isirm of dozens priests radicalized many bishops. As military regimes spread, the church remained the one voice denouncing violations of human rights. Even more controversially, priests and bishops related poverty to the political systems. “God wants men and women to live in freedom with dignity,” said a letter from Chile's bishops in 1977. “God cannot bless situation where man is valued less than his work, and where human dignity is trampled. To seek profit at the cost another person's poverty goes against every divine law, and those who contribute to the creation of inhuman, unjust conditions will suffer the curse of God.” The church again became a significant force in the lives of the poor. Youths were attracted to the priesthood. Masses celebrated by popular priests and bishops were crowded. Many so‐called “basic communities” of lay Catholics became centers of peasant, worker and squatter movements, and the church had to rebut charges of Marxist sympathies. In 1977, El Salvador's bishops declared, “The church condemns Marxism‐Communism, which by Ideology and revolutionary practice denies God and all spiritual values,” adding,“but with the same forcefulness, the church condemns the liberal capitalist system which, although it confesses God, nevertheless in practice denies Him by putting faith profit as the key motive for human progress.” A worried Vatican and angry conservative bishops regained control of the Secretariat of the Bishops' Council, and in 1973 the conservative Colombian prelate, Bishop Alfonso Lopez Trujillo, was appointed as its new Secretary‐General. ‘Mgr. Lopez Trujillo moved to get control of the Puebla confrq.ence and reverse the positions taken at Medellin. The Stsc:retariat circulated a paper arguing that the “theology I i'Ieration” was a “theology of revolution” and emphasizing ie church's evangelical mission over social involvement. But indignant reaction from progressive clergy led to its reacement by a more conciliatory working paper. The issue at Puebla is the future of the church in Latin America. Conservatives working closely with Msgr. Lopez Trujillo will be Raul Cardinal Francisco Primatesta of Car(41b..‐1, Argentina, Pablo Cardinal Munoz Vega of Quito, ??cuador, and Sebastiano Cardinal Baggio, President of the Vatican's Pontifical Commission for Latin America. The progressives will be led by Paulo Cardinal Evaristo Arns Sao Paulo, Brazil, Bishop Leonidas Proalio of Riobamba, xcuador, and Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero of San Sal vador. The progressives will be a minority — but they will represent a majority of the priests. “A people's church merging that does not need bishops,” said a Guatemalan priest. “Whatever the bishops decide at Puebla, the recommendations of Medellin cannot be reversed. Thc church now belongs to the people.”"
Headliners,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/21/archives/headliners-a-presidents-choice-a-quixotic-gesture-trouble-trouble.html,"Into the thunderous breach created when President Caner fired Bella Abzug as chairman of the President's National Advisory Committee on Women has stepped, at least temporarily, Marjorie Bell Chambers, who is national president of the American Association of University Women, former president of Colorado College for Women and a registered Republican. Though a certified feminist on the issues, Mrs. Chambers, herself no stranger to elective office — she sits on the city council of Los Alamos, N. M. — is nevertheless reputed to be milder and more low‐key in her approach to them than Mrs. Abzug. Though she lobbied on Capitol Hill for the successful extension of ratification time for the Equal Rights Amendment, she has avoided involvement in more controversial issues such as lesbian's rights and abortion. No one is quite certain what kind committee Mrs. Chambers will be chairman of, though. Of its 90 members, 26 were said to have resigned in protest over Mrs. Abzug's dismissal, but since then some have reconsidered their resignations. Where is Imam Musa al‐Sadr? Members of the Shiite Moslem community in Lebanon would love to know. The 50-yearold Imam, Shiite spiritual leader and head of Lebanon's Supreme Moslem Shiite Council, disappeared last August after flying to Libya. Many Lebanese Shiites think he was disappeared by Col. Muammar el‐Qaddafi, Libya's secular leader, and they think he is holding the Imam prisoner. Last week, six Lebanese got fed up with it all and hijacked, of all things, Lebanese airliner to demand the Imam's freedom. Since no one believes Lebanon has him that did not work, and eventually the hijackers surrendered. He was elected four times to the House of Representatives, but then things turned sour for Charles W. Sandman Jr., best remembered for his vigorous defense of Richard Nixon during the Watergate hearings. He ran for Governor of New Jersey and was defeated, then lost his Congressional seat. Last week, he lost again; a New Jersey jury returned a verdict against him in a slander suit brought by a Cape May police officer whom Mr. Sandman had accused of police bnitality. Mr. Sandman said he would appeal."

Many Find Coercion in Cults Holds on Members,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/23/archives/many-find-coercion-in-cults-holds-on-members-cults-in-america-last.html,"The following article is based on reporting by Nathaniel Sheppard Jr. and To Thomas. It was written by Mr. Sheppard. Thomas Paris was 20 years old, at the crossroads of youth and adulthood. Be had grown tired ofcollege life in Ohio and set out for the West Coast in search of truth and purpose. As he eased his van along the snaking Oregon coast highway, be picked up three hitchhikers who appeared poor but Last of three articles. seemed at peace with themsehres and the world - the way he would have liked to be. Their names were Innocence, Diligence and Zeal. They said they followed Love Israel, man who headed a Christian family that lived faithfully by the principles of the New Testament. Mr. Paris followed the men to Seattle and joined their Church of Armageddon. A few months later, on Jan. 14, 1972, he ‘Watched two members, Solidarity and Reverence Israel, lose consciousness and die during a ritual in which they inhaled fumes from toluene, an industiial solvent used for breaking down rubber. ‘We Were So Brainwashed’ “Love Israel did nothing,” Mr. Paris recalled. “He wouldn't call the police or emergency squad. He just told us to pray over them and that they would rise again in threi days. He explained the incident away by saying they had not been strong of faith. We were so brainwashed nobody questioned this.” Mr. Paris is one of many former cult members who say they were victims of mind control. Cult leaders deny that they practice brainwashing, and, despite the airing that mind control received as a legal issue in the Charles Manson and Patricia Hearst trials, it is a question that local and Federal authorities have been loath to confront, especially in the conduct o church groups protected by law from in`; terference in the practice of their beliefs. A number of persons who have studied cults compare their techniques with the brainwashing methods - isolation, sensory deprivation, forced confession - used on American prisoners of war in Korea. Dr. John G. Clark, assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School at Massachusetts General Hospital, has examined about 60 former and present cult members and has talked with hundreds of their relatives over a five‐year period. He said that “coercive persuasion and thought‐reform techniques are effectively practiced on naive, uninformed subjects with disastrous health consequences.” A series of interviews by The New York Times with leaders, members and former members of cults, as well as with their relatives and with persons who have studied such groups, showed that cults employ similar techniques in attracting, keeping and manipulating converts. When recruiting new members, former members said, the cults looked for bewildered young persons who showed signs of being transient or troubled. A former member of the Unification Church said: “We recruited everywhere - bus terminals, airports, college campuses, and even around military bases, especially naval bases with a lot of changing traffic. Anywhere there would be a lot of kids.” Dr. Clark attributes the cults’ recruitment success to their ability to induce trances without the knowledge or consent of new recruits. Such trances can be brought about, he said, with constant chanting, singing, dancing, preaching, scripture reading and peer pressure in controlled, isolated setting in which only short periods of sleep — about four hours ‐are allowed. “It is the same process as hypnosis, except that with cults you don't have to have willing subjects,” he asserted. Potential converts are commonly greeted with an outpouring of affection, called “love‐bombing.” Often they are sent to “babes” ranches in secluded areas, such as the The New Ideal City Ranch operated by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church in Booneville,Calif. The ranch was usually described to potential converts only as a communal farm that would welcome visitors for the weekend. Former followers of Mr. Moon said they were not told that the farm was connected with the church until long after they arrived. This, they said, was later justified by church members as “heavenly deception.” Kathie Lowery, church representative, denied that the church ever uses deception in recruiting. Once a cult's potential converts are iso lated, they getibeir first exposure to the cult's teachings, combined with more “love-bombing” and intense peer pressure. They are never left alone, and there is no time to talk over doubts with other newcomers. It is an approach that can overcome strong resistance. Ford Greene, then 23, was so angry at learning that his younger sister had be- come a Unification Church member that in 1974 he drove to the Booneville ranch to persuade her to leave. Instead, he joined. Cults commonly require new members to work long hours at menial jobs or to go out in search of donations and recruits. They are given daily quotas and are chastised if they fail. They are allowed little sleep, and are fed a high‐carbohydrate diet based on rice or oatmeal and bread, with little or no protein. Fasts are sometimes mandatory. In Gallup, N.M., Lindsay McConahy, teacher, joined a Bible‐astrology cult called the Druids and was put to work as an all‐night waitress at a hotel for which the cult supplied labor. During the day she was given chores such as sweeping up dirt at the group's desert commune at Witch Wells, Ariz., and was encouraged to meditate for hours on “Mother” - Laura Copeland, born Genie Leah Garcia, the cult's high priestess, whose whereabouts are no longer known. Converts to cults typically are required, as proof of their commitment, to give up their material possessions. In numerous instances they have turned over cars and large sums of money. Timothy Goodwin, a quadraplegic recruited in Long Beach, Calif., by members of The Way International, was asked for 15 percent of the $1.4 million settlement he had received in the automobile accident in which he was injured two years earlier. The members of The Way promised that the power of their prayers would heal Mr. Goodwin so that he could walk within a year, he said, and he signed contract, the pen in his teeth. At the end of a year, he was not healed and decided to leave. Members of The Way told him that if he did so, the devil would kill him. By this time, he had made out a will leaving all his money to The Way. He sued and was repaid in an out-ofcourt settlement. The charges made in the lawsuit were denied by the Rev. Lowell E. Johnson, spokesman for The Way, which is based in New Knoxville, Ohio. Confession is another typical facet of behavior control in cults. It may be called “witnessing,” as it is in the Tony and Susan Alamo Foundation, a fundamentalist Christian group in Arkansas, or “sharing,” as it is in the Unification Church. Cult members are encouraged to believe they are wretches, and have little contact with skeptical outsiders who might challenge such beliefs. Former cult members said in interviews that their mail was opened and that they had limited access, if any, to telephones. A number of former cult members said they were told that it was better to commit suicide than to be “deprogrammed” - that is, persuaded to reject the cult's teachings. The authority of the leader is absolute within the cult. Doubts are seen by cult members as a sign of weakness or evil. The teachings of the leader, however patent the contradictions they contain, may not be questioned. Cult leaders can, and often do, use sex as a means of control. They may decree abstinence.; marriage, abortion or divorce. David Brandt Berg, 59, the leader of the Children of God, has even decreed prostitution, telling women members it is permissible to seduce wealthy and influential businessmen to save souls and raise money for the church. The Children of God, investigated by the New York Attorney General in 1973 and 1974, began moving its followers abroad in 1972. At that time, a church spokesman said the exodus reflected the group's desire to preach the gospel worldwide, and its conviction that the United States was soon to fall under the judgment of God. The group, now also called the Family of Love, has a worldwide membership of 8,010 adults and 1,518 children, in 820 colonies, according to a 1978 newsletter. Only about one‐tenth are left in the United States. Mr. Berg, a recluse believed to reside in Switzerland and Spain, extols women members to “be fishers of men,” and they are often required to frequent discotheques, singles bars, luxury hotels and other places where they might trade sexual favors for money. Within the cult, the practice is called “flirty‐fishing,” and it is a serious business. Women are required to fill out forms for each person they seduce. The form's entries note “the type of fish flirted” Government officials, including police- men and military persOnnel, professionals, journalists, salesmen and others the amounts of money received, and the amounts spent on clothes, jewelry, perfume, drinks and transportation. The monthly “witnessing” report also requires that women members list their “top three FF winners of the month.” A woman who asked that her name not be used was married to another Children of God member but was still required to “flirty‐fish” potential wealthy supporters. She sometimes spent weeks traveling with a regular customer who paid $500 for each date. “My husband and I felt terrible about internally, although we were so brainwashed that we pretended we were glad to have the chance to win over a new soul,” the woman said. “We did not dare say anything because our dedication would have been called into question.” Thomas Paris — who took the name Enthusiasm Israel, became a trusted member of the Church of Armageddon and was sent to establish a colony in Alaska - said he left the cult because he fell in love with a woman he met in Alaska and Love Israel “gave her to somebody else.” Mr. Paris left the cult two and a half years ago and, even with psychiatric help, still finds himself unable to resume normal relationships with people. He feels they respond just as strangely to him now as they did when he in the cult. “Tom is not of very sound character. He is mostly confused,” Logic Israel, spokesman for the cult, said in an interview in Seattle. Mr. Israel is the son of Steve Allen, the entertainer. “We believe in order,” Mr. Israel said, when asked about behavior control. “Our family has a head. We're a body. So order is a very important part of our lives. Everyone is here because of exercise of free will. Everyone has to give of him or herself to the family, or there would not be the love that exists between our members. Anyone is free to leave at any time.”"
New York Clergymen Protest Catholic Stand,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/23/archives/new-york-clergymen-protest-catholic-stand-with-deep-sadness.html,"Walking two by two down Park Avenue and then over to Fifth, their black and white and red vestments billowing in the cold wind, about three dozen Jewish and Protestant clergy led 300 men and women in a march on St. Patrick's Cathedral yesterday to protest the anti‐abortion statements and actions of Roman Catholic church leaders. The procession reached the cathedral, at Fifth Avenue and 51st Street, shortly after 1 P.M. The ministers and rabbis climbed slowly up the steps; then, a minister at the head of the group unrolled a three-foot-long white paper scroll. He hung it on the cathedral's center doorway by a white ribbon that he looped over the hands of a figurine of Sister Elizabeth Seton built into the bronze door. The scroll bore a “declaration of religious conscience on the spirit of intolerance.” It said, among other things, that Roman Catholic leaders “have opted for a kind of demagoguery that destroys the spirit of dialogue and sows the seeds of bitter religious discord.” “It is with deep sadness that we pen this declaration and deliver it to the door of the foremost cathedral of U.S. Roman Catholicism,” the declaration began. But, it went on, the “institutional involvement and political action of cardinals, bishops and priests have sought by all means” to void the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that struck down laws that made abortion a crime. “We view with alarm the growing escalation of violent language and acts that have the appearance of support of the leadership of the church and the extent to which extreme polarization of the issue has led to the cessation of religious dialogue and political dehate,” the declaration said. “It is our belief that the continuation of this position not only threatens the peace of our ecumenical position, but, perhaps more importantly, the civil amity and political tolerance that makes our democracy work.” After the scroll was hung, some of the clergy began to sing “America.” Others farther down the steps picked up the tune. The minister who hung the scroll, the Rev. Howard Moody of Judson Memorial Church in Greenwich Village, spoke briefly to reporters who clustered about him. Then he said, “Go in peace,” and walked down the steps. A few minutes later, a man in a gray suit pushed open the heavy door from inside the cathedral. He reached for the scroll, got it, and quickly went back inside. Later, a spokesman for the Archdiocese, asked for comment, said, “This is a bit disappointing, to think that other people of religious conviction do not share our senitivity when it comes to the loss of unborn life.”  The spokesman, Father Kenneth G. Jadoff, said that six million abortions have apparently taken place since the Supreme Court ruling. “So this is a crime equal at least in numbers to the holocaust,” he said. “Abortion is the holocaust of the 1970's. And the Catholic Church will not be silent while innocent life is being taken.” Father Jadoff then took note of the fact that the declaration - a copy of which was sent to Terence Cardinal Cooke, and which 44 clergy from the New York area have subscribed to had been hung on the figurine of Sister Elizabeth Seton. “She became a saint because she took care of unwanted children,” he said. “I'd say that's an ironic twist.” The protest by the clergy began at noon, with a 45‐minute service at the Central Presbyterian Church, at Park Avenue and 64th Street. Eleven ministers and rabbis took part in the service. Several dozen more sat in the front pews. Behind them sat perhaps 400 or 450 people - most of them women, of all ages, and, judging from their clothing, of nearly every economic level. The service, and the procession later, were planned by a group of clergy called Religious Leaders for a Free Choice, and were timed to coincide with the sixth anniversary of the Supreme Court's ruling. The ministers and rabbis sought to portray their action as something other than an anti‐Catholic protest, however; they stressed that it was a plea to the church for “tolerance and sensitivity” to the views of others, and some noted that other religious groups also oppose abortion. Mr. Moody, at St. Patrick's, said, “If we were in Salt Lake City, we would probably march into the Mormon temple.” Yesterday's action was aimed at the Catholic Church, he said, because in New York especially, “that is where the loudest expression” of opposition has come. The protesters were countered by groups in favor of abortion, who held news conferences."
The Real Federal Budget Won't Emerge Till Later,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/23/archives/the-real-federal-budget-wont-emerge-till-later-one-of-many.html,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 - President Carter's Federal budget, presented today in four pale green volumes, will bear no resemblance in form and only some similarity in substance to the real Federal budget for the year that begins Oct. 1. Special tome New York Times Unlike the carefully packaged plan that is making headlines, the final budget will not even exist in one place. Instead, will be an agglomeration of laws, old and new, and of economic realities that may be very different from the forecasts within the green covers. This seems untidy for a simple reason: It is. But it used to be worse. Since 1975, Congress has been making an effort to look at Federal spending and taxes as a whole, the way the President and the Office of Management and Budget do. The process often breaks down, when an emergency measure like disaster relief is considered, but it has proved far more durable than many observers expected. The new Congressional budget process has produced less spending and has brought more order into legislative decisions on the Federal budget. But it has not always been the President's kind of order. The more Congress knows about the budget, the more it wants to decide. By the time spending bills are voted on, in the summer and early fall, Mr. Carter's budget will be only one of several recommendations, and it will not be the most recent or, in many instances, the most influential. Some items in any budget must be taken with heavy skepticism. Administrations regularly ignore reality when they list no money for college library aid, for example, because Congress always votes it anyway. And all recent Presidents have projected lower costs for the impact aid program that helps school districts with many children of Federal employees, but Congress has always financed the program in full. Two of this year's most important legislative proposals, involving billions of dollars each, may well not be enacted in any form. The budget projects spending more than $2 billion on real wage insurance, which few Congressional leaders are confident will be enacted, and projects savings to the Medicare and Medicaid programs of $2 billion from -hospital cost containment. Even if the latter measure passes this summer, it is likely to be changed on Capitol Hill and will have no immediate impact on Government spending. Other assumptions in the budget are little more than guesses. The Agriculture Department, for instance, has little idea how much it will spend for farm price supports until it knows what the weather will be like next year. The new budget projects $2 billion less for price supports than is being paid out this year. Congress did not effect major cbanges in many programs proposed by Mr. Carter's budget last year because he did not propose much that was new. But the fate of his $6 billion urban program, proposed last spring after the presentation of the budget, is illustrative of one of the problems. the new budget procedures present for an Administration. Once the procedures are in motion, they make it difficult for Congress to act on later proposals, and this was a factor in the Administration's getting only a quarter of the money it asked. Several of the modest proposals in Mr. Carter's budget for the fiscal year 1979 did not get Congressional approval. For instance, three and a half months into this fiscal year, there is still no teen‐age pregnancy program, even though it was put forth with some fanfare a year ago. Congress finally authorized such a program in the closing days of the session but never appropriated any money for it. Even if it had, the program could not have got under way because the Administration does not have the regulations written vet. Probably the most important element in the eventual budget is the First Budget Resolution, a joint resolution passed by both houses of Congress by May 15, setting out “targets” for revenue and spend, ing. Congress is not legally bound to stick to them, but first resolutions have proved far less tentative than expected, and the objection that a bigger appropriation for any program will exceed the first budget resolution's “target” has become the most effective Congressional argument against appropriations measures. In the next few weeks, Congressional committees will go over the figures in the President's budget, setting them against what they know departments Wanted and their own ideas of what a given program needs. And it will put together recommendations to the Budget Committees in the Senate and House. On the military budget, for example, each house's Armed Services Committee and the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee will be offering their advice to the Budget Committees, which have their own specialized staffs to ponder those recommendations. From their staff economists and those of the Congressional Budget Office, another major creation of the 1979 Budget Act, the committees will also be hearing forecasts about the economy: what it can be expected to produce in taxes, where inflation and interest rates are likely to go and what sort of unemployment to expect. In late March and early April, the two budget committees will draft budget resolutions, not line-by-line proposals like those Mr. Carter made today but broader guidelines, $115.7 billion for national defense or $31.4 billion for “education/ training/employment /social services.” Those proposals will then be fought out on the floor of each chamber. If history is any guide, the Senate will fight mildly over such questions as how much to expect the farm program to cost, while the House will debate bitterly over the relative spending for the military and various social programs. Republicans in the House will try to force deep cuts in spending and taxes, will lose and will then try to defeat the budget resolution entirely. They may succeed and force the committee to try again. Once a resolution goes through, and only then, Congress is permitted to act on financing legislation. It does that through the summer, as different committees and programs compete for the money under the various overall categories. In September, a Second Budget Resolution must be adopted, with mandatory ceilings on spending by function. This is supposed to be the product of more up-todate economic advice and the accumulated wisdom of Congress as it considered other bills throughout the summer. In fact, the second resolution has become rather anticlimactic, more of an accountant's effort at toting up what Congress has decided to spend than a policy document. Finally, by Oct. 1, all spending and revenue laws governing the incoming fiscal year are supposed to have been passed. That has worked pretty well except when a basically legislative issue, such as Federal funding of abortions for, poor women, has produced a deadlock. To take one example of the impact of, the process, the Budget Committee had the dominant voice in the size, though not the details, of last year's tax cut. At its urging, the tax cut was scaled down to $18 billion from the $24.5 billion proposed in the January budget. The President agreed with the decision, but he might have found it politically hard to scale back his tax cut proposal without the authority of the Budget committees. The New York Times /Jan. 21,1979"
Supreme Court Roundup,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/23/archives/supreme-court-roundup-power-of-us-over-laetrile-to-be-weighed-blue.html,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 72 - The Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether the Federal Government has the authority to ban the use of laetrile, the controversial substance said by its proponAnts to be a cure for cancer. Special tone New York Times The Justices granted the Government's request for review of a Federal appeals court decision last July that held that “terminally ill cancer patients” must be allowed to use laetrile. That decision, which the Justice Department told the Justices “significantly endangers the public health,” reasoned that the Food and Drug Administration's usual requirement that a drug be safe and effective is irrelevant if a patient “is going to die of cancer regardless of what may be done.” The decision, written by the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, required a patient to present a doctor's affidavit certifying to the terminal nature of the illness, a procedure that has apparently been used only about 500 times since the decision was issued. The Justice Department, in its request for Supreme Court review, argued that the eventual impact would be much broader because “there is no way of distinguishing accurately between ‘terminal’ cancer patients and those who will respond to conventional cancer treatment.” Even if there was a way, the petition said, it would be impossible to restrict laetrile to the terminally ill once it legitimately entered general circulation. The case, U.S. v. Rutherford (No. 78605), began in 1975 as a class‐action suit by a group of cancer patient's seeking to force the Government to allow the interstate distribution of laetrile, a substance derived from apricot pits. A broad district court opinion held, among other things, that the Government ban violated a “constitutional right of privacy.” The appeals court did not address this constitutional issue. But the issue will almost certainly be raised by both sides in the argument before the Supreme Court, which will take place this spring. The Justices also took the following actions today: The Court declined to hear constitutional challenges to the blue laws of New Jersey and Texas. In the New Jersey case, Vornado v. Degnan (No. 78‐866), the Justices let stand a 540‐2 decision by the state's Supreme Court last July. That court upheld a 1959 law, now in effect in 10 of New Jersey's 21 counties, banning Sunday sales of clothing, furniture and building materials. Vornado Inc., owner of the Two Guys discount chain, deliberately defied the law in 1975, was sued in six cities and won a lower court ruling that the law was unconstitutional. The Texas case, Morris v. Texas (No. 78‐850), was an appeal by a store manager who had been fined $109 for sell- ing two pairs of socks in violation of Texas’ blue laws. The Justices declined to hear an appeal from a Texas state wart order allowing both the state and a private plaintiff in malpractice suit to get access to the medical records of thousands of women who had obtained abortions at a chain of clinics in Texas. The clinics had argued that the discovery order would Violate the patient's constitutional right to privacy. Associate Justice William J. Brennan Jr. had granted a stay of the order last July; the stay is now automatically dissolved. (Reproductive Services Inc. v. Walker, No. 78‐719). The Court agreed to hear an appeal by the Federal Government from a district court ruling that the Government could not constitutionally restrict benefits under the mother's insurance prograiI of the Social Security System to women who were once married to the deceased wageearner. To qualify for this program, which was designed by Congress to allow a widow to stay home with her children rather than get a job, a woman must have been married to the wage earner at some point, although not necessarily at the time of his death. The lower court held that this restriction constituted discriminates against illegitimate children. In its appeal, the Government notes that the child's Social Security benefit is paid under another program and does not depend on the mother's marital status. The Government says the cost to the Social Security System of the lower court's decision would be $60 million a year. (Cali, fano v. Boles, No. 78‐808). The Court declined to hear a constitutional challenge by five Florida state senators to the two-year-old “sunshine amendment” to the Florida Constitution, requiring public officials to disclose their assets and liabilities. The legislators said they did not challenge the right of a state ethics commission to gather the information but ob- jected to widespread public disclosure that they said “serves no function other than gratification of prurient curiosity.” A Federal appeals court said basically that the senators had a point but that the state's interest in political integrity outweighed their right to privacy. (Plante v. Gonzalez, No. 78444). The Justices let stand a Federal appeals court ruling that the admission into evidence of a criminal defendant's confession to a state psychiatrist violated the defendant's constitutional rights under the 1966 Miranda decision. The State of Iowa, which had used the confession to convict the man, had argued that the Miranda decision had never been extended to this situation. (Augur v. Collins, No. 78213)."
Abortion Foes March in Capital on Anniversary of Legalization,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/23/archives/abortion-foes-march-in-capital-on-anniversary-of-legalization-the.html,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 - Chanting “Life, Life, Life” and “No compromise,” about 60,000 people opposed to abortion gathered here today on the sixth anniversary of the Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion. Walking in a bitter winter wind from the White House to the Capitol in a “March for Life,” the demonstrators carried post- ers with pictures of babies and captions such as “Thank God, Jesus Wasn't Aborted” and “I was adopted, Not Aborted, Thank God.” Earlier in the day, at a news conference held by groups favoring legal abortion, Eleanor Smeal, president of the National Organization for Women, called for the two sides to meet and seek areas of common interest, such as birth control and family planning. But that offer was rejected by Nellie J. Gray, president of the March for Life organization, who said, “Pro‐life people will not negotiate with baby killers. They must stop killing babies forthwith.” The crowd exploded in a chant of “No compromise, no compromise” as a man in the front lines hefted black cross on which a plastic baby doll had been nailed. At a news conference held by the National Abortion Rights Action League, Gloria Steinem held up a picture of Rosaura Jimenez, the 27-year-old Texas woman who died after an illegal abortion last year. Arguing the plight of the woman pregnant with an unwanted child, Miss Steinem pointed to the picture of Miss Jimenez and said, “This is the true human cost. You're seeing again the slaughter and maiming. Abortion for women has always been the intimate Vietnam in the past. The point now is not one of conscience or morality but choice. The other side has the right not to have an abortion but what's going on now is a struggle for political control to turn women again into the means of reproduction by the compulsory pregnancy forces.” The National Abortion Rights Action League said that Miss Jimenez was the first reported victim of an illegal abortion following the restrictions that Congress put on Medicaid funds for abortions for poor women in August 1977. Ellen Frankfort, co‐author of a book about Miss Jimenez titled “Rosie: Investigation of a Wrongful Death,” announced the establishment of the “Rosie Jimenez Fund” to aid low-income women who would have qualified for Medicaid‐funded abortions. Miss Frankfort said, “What irony that she who lies dead from an illegal abortion should have been given the name that symbolizes ‘life’ to those who oppose abortion and‐demonstrate with live roses.” This was a reference to the roses that the groups against abortion sent to members of Congress who voted to restrict the Federal funds. The fund, which Miss Frankfort said was providing abortions for 10 women in Texas, currently has about $.5,000 in contributions. Miss Frankfort added that the sum was “a drop in the bucket” compared to the $40 to 150 million from public sources previously available. The abortion rights league estimated that the number of Federally financed abortions bad dropped 98 percent since Congress restricted the used of Medicaid funds. The groups against abortion also backed legislation that was passed to prevent women in the military and the wives and daughters of military personnel from having abortions paid for out of public funds. Women in the Peace Corps are also restricted from such aid, and the United States Commission on Civil Rights is no longer allowed to provide Congress with information on abortions. The public funding issue is expected to be revived again this year as Congress prepares its budget. The legislative director of the National Right to Life Committee, Sean Downey, said his group would be lobbying for added prohibitions on the use of public money for abortions. The groups against abortion are also seeking the passage of a constitutional amendment that would outlaw abortions. Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, introduced such a proposal on the first day of the 96th Congress earlier this month. ‘ Other versions are expected to be submited later in the year by Senator Jake Gam, Republican of Utah, and Repesentatives Romano L. Mazzoli, Democrat of Kentucky, and James L. Oberstar, Democrat of Minnesota. Because of the increasing attack on abortion, Mrs. Smeal of NOW said she had issued an invitation for activists from both sides to attend a Feb. 15 con- ference to try to end the “polarization and violence” that she said have been. precipitated by the controversy. “Is this an attack on abortion or is this an attack on contraception itself,” asked Mrs. Smeal. “We don't know. We feel abortion must be one of the choices, but reasonable people must have a common goal for reducing the need for abortion.” Mrs. Smeal said the aim of the conference would be to discuss “a comprehensive reproductive health program.” She added, “The issue of abortion must not be used to eliminate other avenues of reproductive choice. We want to know where the lines are drawn.”"
Court at Child Custody Hearing Bars Public Over Synanon Issue,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/25/archives/court-at-child-custody-hearing-bars-public-over-synanon-issue.html,"SAN RAFAEL, Calif., Jan. 24 —Marin County Superior Court judge excluded the public today from a child custody hearing over charges by the father of a 4-year-old boy that Synanon, the controversial drug rehabilitation (organization, provides an “undesirable” environment in which to raise children. Special to New York Times Judge Henry J. Broderick ordered the hearing closed at the request of Valerie K. Law, a longtime Synanon member who is the mother of the boy, Dmitri A. Pagel. Mrs. Law said that because of re‘ cent charges against Synanon, news coverage of the hearing would turn “a private family matter into a circus.” Synanon has been accused recently with beating and attempting to murder some of its critics, the purchase of thousands of dollars worth of weapons, the forced sterilization of male members over age 16, and forcing pregnant female members to have abortions. Mrs. Law was awarded custody of the child in 1976 after her divorce from David Fagel, a former official in Synanon, who agreed to the custody award at that time. After the divorce, Mrs. Law married another Synanon member, James Law. Mr. Fagel, a 46-year-old salesman in Los Angeles, who left Synanon in 1977 after 19 years in the organization, said in an interview that Synanon..and not his former wife, exercised authority over their son. He said changes in Synanon since the original custody award had transformed it into “an oppressive organization without individual freedom that provides an unfit atmosphere for raising children.” Mr. Fagel gave reporters copies of a speech allegedly delivered by the founder of Synanon, Charles Dederich, which Mr. Fagel said was the basis for the organiation's decision to abort all pregnancies and sterilize all male adults. The transcript reads: “If people want to havechildren, they probably should not join Synanon. I think children are a very bad investment Every baby takes up a bed ant $100,000 to $200,000 worth of energy over 18 years. There is no profit in raising children.” Mr. Fagel, a former heroin addict who says he was rehabilitated by Synanon. said that his son, like all the children at the organization's 3,200‐acre estate near Tomales Bay, was removed from his parents’ ‐custody at six months of age and placed in the Synanon school, which houses and raises 160 children. He said his former wife seldom sees their son and has no control over his upbringing. In his petition for custody, Mr. Fagel contends that if his son remains in Syhanon's custody, “all important decisions in his life” will be made by the organization."
Test to Check Fetus Is Called Safe,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/26/archives/test-to-check-fetus-is-called-safe-women-over-35.html,"BOSTON, Jan. 25 (AP) — The largest study ever conducted on women who take a genetic test to check the health of their fetuses has concluded that the examination, called amniocentesis, is “safe, hiphlv reliable and extremely accurate.” The survey, of 3,000 women who received amniocentesis, was conducted atthe University of California in San Francisco. The results were published intoday's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. A seperate report in the same issue,prepared by the Hastings Center, a re-search center in Hastings-on-Hudson,N.Y., recommended that the test bemade available to all women who riskbearing defective babies. The test is controversial becausewomen often have abortions when theyfind that their unborn babies are likely tohave birth defects. Women Over 35 The tests are usually given to pregnant women over 35 years old, since they are most likely to have children with Down's syndrome, or to women who are believed 1 to be carriers of other genetic defects,such as hemophilia. The California survey found 113 fetuses that were believed to be defective. In but seven cases, the mothers decided tohave abortions. Among disorders disclosed by the tests were Down's syndrome, the most common cause of severe mental retardation; sickle-call anemia, and Tay sachs dis-ease. In the amniocentesis test, doctors analyze amniotic fluid that is drawn from the mother's womb with a needle. The California doctors said that in the 3.000 cases they had studied, 14 errors were made in analyzing and reporting the findings of the tests. In two cases, these mistakes resulted in women aborting normal fetuses because they thought they were defective. The doctors also said that the tests might have caused a slight increase in the number of women who had spontaneous abortions. The Hastings report was financed by the National Foundation‐March of Dimes. It included a list of 18 suggested guidelines for doctors and clinics that provide amniocentesis and other prenatal tests. The report recommended that the Government pay for these tests for poor women and that doctors be careful not to coerce women to have abortions when the test showed that the baby would be defective. Amniocentesis will disclose the sex of the fetus, and Tabitha M. Powledge, a coauthor of the Hastings report, said that the panel of experts that had drawn up the guidelines feared that women might have abortions if they were not happy with the baby's gender. However, the panel recommended that no legal restrictions be imposed to limit this use of the tests."
Pope With a style All His Own,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/26/archives/pope-with-a-style-all-his-own-john-paul-ii.html,"ROME, Jan. 25 - Weeks before Pope John Paul II set out for his trip to Santo Domingo and MexiCo, he started learning Spanish, getting up an hour early, at 5 A.M., to find the necessary time. Spanish‐speaking countries have shown, the 58year‐old Pope, who is fluent in English, French, German, Italian and Latin, has already achieved a measure of proficiency in the language. He also has a command of Russian, which he used yesterday in a conversation here with the Soviet’ Foreign Minister, Andrei A. Gromyko. “The trouble the Holy Father took to be able to speak to Latin Americans in their own tongue is typical of the enthusiasm- and dogged determination that he brings to everything he tackles,” Vatican official commented: The Apostolic Palace, like the White House, is supposed to transform its incumbent into a man quite different from what he was before he moved in. Under the first non‐Italian Pope since 1523, and the first Pole to occupy the papacy, it may turn out to be the other way around. While the Pope is essentially the same man, Karol Jozef Wok tyla, who was Archbishop of Cracow, life in the sacred palaces around St. Peter's Basilica is being revolutionized as he introduces his own style. On the way out are even such inveterate Roman customs as the siesta, when everyone, from cardinal to sacristan, would doze off. The new Pope, like his predecessor, the gentle, smiling and shy John Paul I, whose pontificate lasted only 33 days, avoids the majestic “we” that was usually used, often even in private conversation, When Vatican officials prepared a speech in French to be delivered to the diplomatic corps at its first audience, John Paul II substituted “I” and “me” for every first person plural. Old‐school prelates and Vatican courtiers are visibly taken aback when the Pope, after chatting with visitors in several languages. cups his hands in front of his mouth and announces with the voice of a sports coach: “And now — a benediction.” The Pope habitually addresses crowds and audiences with the traditional “Praised be Jesus Christ,” as Polish peasants still do when they meet a priest. It was this formula, pronounced in Italian with only a faint accent, that broke the ice with the Romans. On the evening of Oct. 16 the throng in St. Peter's Square reacted frigidly when the choice of the College of Cardinals was announced. Few in the vast piazza had heard of Cardinal Wojtyla, and fewer still knew the pronunciation of his name (it is voy-TEE-vuh). But from his initial “Praised be Jesus Christ” the 264th Bishop of Rome held that throng spellbound. The first wave of cheers rose when he said that the cardinal‐electors had called him “from a far‐away country — far away, but always so close in the communion of faith.” The future pope was born on May 18, 1920. in the southern town of Wadowice, where he attended elementary and high school; he moved with his father to Cracow, 30 miles away, in 1938. In those years he started writing poetry, played soccer and went canoeing in the lakes in the north and camping and skiing in the mountains in the south. The love of outdoor life and sports has stayed with him throughout his ecclesiastical career. Five days after his elevation, in what amounted to the first news conference given by a pope, a reporter asked, “Holy Father, will you go skiing again?” With a quizzical look at Vatican dignitaries, he replied, “I do not think they will permit me to do that.” There are frequent reports that John Paul II, known to be unhappy about putting on weight for lack of exercise during his first months in office, wants to have a tennis court or swimming pool or both at Castel Gandolfo. During his youth in Poland, after the Nazi occupation began, he was interested in acting and helped found an amateur drama group that staged clandestine performances of the plays of the 19th‐century Polish romanticists. At the time he held down a manual job in a chemical factory that provided in‐i come and protection from being deported to a labor camp. He had just lost his father, a retired noncommissioned officer in the Polish Army (his mother died when he was 9 years old and an older brother, a doctor, died before World War II). The young man who was acting in the underground theater was also about to enter an underground seminary - a center for priestly studies set up in the archepiscopal palace in defiance of Nazi order. Meanwhile, he had an active social life; at parties he would sing a good baritone, accompanying himself on the guitar. During this period, too, according to the Rome representative of the AntiDefamation League of B'nai B'rith, Dr. Joseph L. Lichten, who was born in Poland, young Wojtyla assisted hunted Jews in finding shelter and false identification papers. As a result he was blacklisted by the Nazis. In 1942 he failed to turn up at his factory job and was not seen until the end of the war. By then he had almost fin.ished his theological studies in his hideout in the basement of the archbishop's palace and had done plenty of reading. Ordained a priest on Nov. 1, 1946, Father Wojtyla was sent to Rome for postgraduate work. He returned two years later with a doctorate in philosophy from the Angelicum, a college run by the Dominican order. After serving briefly as an assistant pastor in a village near Cracow and then in a parish in that city, he earned another-doctorate, in theology, and in 1954 was appointed professor of social ethics at the Catholic Univdrsity in Lublin. Contributions to scholarly magazines at home and abroad followed - he has 300 articles on philosophical and religious themes and three major books to his credit - along with a reputation as a lecturer and preacher. Father Wojtyla was made an auxiliary bishop in 1958 at the age of 38, becoming the youngest member of the Polish hierarchy, and he was designated Archbishop of Cracow in 1964. Three years later Pope Paul VI raised him to the cardinalate. As Archbishop he had to design a personal coat of arms; the result was was austere: a bare wooden cross on a blue field and a iarge letter M, for Mary, with the Latin legend “Totus Tuus” (“Entirely Thine”). The cult of the Virgin, traditionally fervent in Poland, is an indication of bedrock conservatism in the Roman Catholic Church. From pronouncements on other aspects of faith and morals, it is now clear that Pope John Paul II is unwavering on doctrine. He has repeatedly upheld the traditional opposition to divorce, artificial means of birth control and abortion. He has also urged priests to observe discipline. As Archbishop he was said to be mild with the faithful and stern with the clergy. In world affairs the Pope, who visited the United States in 1969 and 1976, professes pragmatism. He has declared that the Vatican would seek a dialogue with all nations, regardless of their political and social systems. The Communist regime in Poland once seemed to be looking forward to collaboration with Cardinal Wojtyla, whom it then regarded as more flexible than the indomitable Primate of the Polish church, Stefan Cardinal Wyszynski. Its attitude cooled as the Cracow Cardinal ,became increasingly outspoken against official atheism and in support of human rights. The first Pontiff to live under a Marxist system, he will have an opportunity to speak out on social problems and human rights in Latin America. The challenge will be more than linguistic.

A.D.A. Poll Rates Maguire Top Liberal,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/28/archives/new-jersey-weekly-ada-poll-rates-maguire-top-liberal.html,"WASHINGTON REPRESENTATIVE Andrew Maguire, the third‐term Democratic Congressman from Ridgefield, led his New Jersey colleagues last year in the voting‐record report cards issued by Americans for Democratic Action. The liberal lobbying group puts out yearly ratings of how individual Congressmen vote on approximately 20 major issues. Mr. Maguire got a 90 for his efforts in 1978. At the other end of the state's 15member House delegation were scores of 35 by Representatives Robert A. Roe, Democrat of Wayne, and Joseph G Minish, Democrat of West Orange. Even with his 90, Mr. Maguire continued to slip a bit on the A.D.A.'s re- port cards. In his freshman year, in 1975, he scored a solid 100, and then dropped to 95 in the two succeeding years, which was his average for the four‐year period. In achieving a score of 90 in 1978, Mr. Maguire voted “right” on 18 of the 20 foreign and domestic issues selected by the A.D.A. Following are some of the positions on which he agreed with the organization: For a constitutional amendment to provide full voting representation in Congress for the District of Columbia. (This amendment was adopted by the House by a vote of 289 to 127.) - For an amendment to permit Federal funds for abortions. (This amendment was rejected, 287 to 122.) Against allowing states to rescind their ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. (Rejected, 227 to 196.) Against an amendment to prohibit the use of funds for busing students farther than the school nearest their homes. (Adopted, 235 to 158.) flFor an amendment to transfer more than $7.5 billion from national defense to programs for housing, community and regional development, education, social services and health. (Rejected, 313 to 98.) 41For an amendment to delete $2.1 billion for a nuclear‐powered aircraft carrier. (Rejected, 218 to 150). New Jerseyans nearest to Mr. Maguire in the 1978 ratings were former Representative Helen S. Meyner, Democrat of Phillipsburg, who was defeated for re‐election last November, and. Representative Frank Thompson Jr., Democrat of Trenton, both with 75's. Over the last four years, Mrs. Meyner was second to Mr. Maguire with a combined score of 82.5, edging out Mr. Thompson, who had an 82. Although Mr. Roe had a combined four‐year score of 55, a New York Times poll of the New Jersey delegation in the past session of Congress showed that Mr. Roe's colleagues regarded him as the state's ablest Congressman. The stands taken by the A.D.A. appear to have been losing favor with the New Jersey delegation over the last four years. Almost without exception, - the state's Representatives voted in favor of the group's position more often in 1975 and 1976 than they did in 1978. The 12 New Jersey Congressmen who had full voting records in each of the four years (1975 through 1978) had a combined score of 66. But for 1978, their combined score had dipped to 56. This was in keeping with a more conservative trend in Congress, according to Leon Shull, the A.D.A.'s national director. Compared against the record of the entire House, New Jersey's 56 in 1978 was high. The full House received a collective score of just 38. In the Senate, Harrison A. Williams Jr. continued to rank among the nation's most liberal Senators on the scorecards. For the six‐year period of 1973 through 1978, Mr. Williams had an average score of 85, but in 1978 he slipped to 80. Senator Clifford P. Case, the liberal Republican who was defeated by Senator Bill Bradley last November, used to top even Mr. Williams in the standings, scoring a 95 in 1976 and a 90 in 1977. But in 1978, his last year, he skidded to 65 in the ratings. Under a no‐nonsense style of keeping score, the A.D.A. counts an absence as harshly as a vote against the position it favors. Mr. Case was absent for, or failed to state a position on, three of the 20 votes that the group counted in 1978. This cost him 15 points. Some of the major Senate votes favored by the A.D.A. in 1978 were these: For deleting tuition tax credits for private and parochial elementary and secondary schools. For giving the District of Columbia full voting representation in Congress, including two Senators. Against lifting price controls on newly discovered natural gas by 1985. (Both New Jersey Senators disagreed with the A.D.A. on this vote, as did the majority in the Senate). Against allowing states to rescind their ratifications of the Equal Rights Amendment. For ratifying the Panama Canal treaty, turning the canal over to Panama at the end of the century and guaranteeing its neutrality. For disapproving the Administration plan to sell $4.5 billion worth of jet fighter planes to Israel, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. In the House, Mr. Maguire's high rat- ing dropped to 90 in 1978 because of an absence and because of his support of tax credits for tuition paid to private and parochial schools. Representative Peter W. Rodino Jr., Democrat of Newark and dean of the New Jersey delegation, had scores in the 80's and 90's in the years between 1973 and 1977, but received an unrealistic 35 in 1978 because of absences, attributed to illness at home. Why did Representatives Roe and Minish get low scores of 35 in 1978? Mr. Roe differed with the A.D.A. by favoring private- and parochial‐school tuition tax credits, by taking a stand opposite to Mr. Maguire's on prohibiting the use of Federal funds for abortions, by favoring the restoration of eight water projects that President Carter had cut from the appropriations bill, by favoring authority for a neutron bomb and by opposing the transfer of more than $7.5 billion from natiional defense to housing and social programs. Two absences contributed to Mr. Minish's low score. Here is how other members of the New Jersey delegation scored (the first figure is the 1978 score, and the second is the average score for the last four years): James J. Florio...............55....62 William J. Hughes.............55....61 James J. Howard...............60....76 Millicent Fenwick.............55....66 Edwin B. Forsythe.............40....36 Harold C. Hollenbeck..........50.... Joseph G. Minish..............35....59 Matthew J. Rinaldo............50....61 Joseph A. LeFante.............20... Edward J. Patten..............59....60. Mr. Hollenbeck and Mr. LeFante were elected in 1976, and Mr. LeFante's 1978 score was affected by absences due to illness. ■"
The Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/28/archives/the-nation-lines-harden-in-the-battle-over-abortions.html,"What reconciliation is possible between those who call abortion murder and those who call it a matter of individual conscience? The answer may well be “none,” simply because the strength of the antiabortion movement lies in the inherent conviction that the issue is not negotiable. Last week, as 60,000 persons took part in the annual “March for Life” in Washington, marking the sixth anniversary of the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion, the National Organization for Women proposed that both sides discuss ways to end “polarization and violence.” Eleanor Smeal, the NOW president, suggested that “reasonable people must have a common goal for reducing the need for abortion.” But Nellie J. Gray, the March for Life organizer, replied: “Prolife people will not negotiate with baby‐killers.” The more militant antiabortion leaders perhaps sense that any discussion with free‐choice advocates might deflect their drive for a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion. It is not only women's rights groups that oppose the amendment. Civil rights organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Uniop contend that, aside from the question of a woman's right to decide, Government action to restrict or outlaw abortion amounts to an unconstitutional enactment of religious doctrine into law. On that ground the A.C.L.U. has challenged the Hyde Amendment, which restricts the use of Medicaid funds for abortions. The “polarization” has led to the destniction or vandalizing of several abortion clinics in the past year, and to vexing interreligious tensions. Last week, Protestant and Jewish clergy marched to St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York and posted on the door a “declaration of religious conscience.” On abortion, the scroll said, Roman Catholic leaders “have opted for kind of demagoguery that destroys the spirit of dialogue and sows the seeds of bitter religious discord.” An official of the Archdiocese responded: “Abortion is the holocaust of the 1970's. The Catholic Church will not be silent while innocent life is being taken.” Talmadge Takes Alcohol Treatment Senator Herman E. Talmadge of Georgia, facing a Senate ethics committee inquiry, checked into Bethesda Naval Hospital last week and the/i was flown to California for treatment of alcohol abuse and exhaustion. “He knows what his problem is,” said former Representative Wilbur D. Mills after visiting Mr. Talmadge at the alcohol rehabilitation center of Long Beach Naval Hospital. Mr. Mills, who suffered from alcoholism, gave up the chairmanship of the House Ways and Means Committee in 1979. The illness and the disclosure of questionable financial dealings, brought up in the course of a messy divorce, have raised doubts about Mr. Talmadge's political future. He will be the first Senator in a decade to undergo a full‐fledged ethics committee trial. Argument could begin this week. The allegations include payments to clandestine bank accounts and mishandling of gifts, campaign funds and personal income taxes. Gov. George B. Busbee of Georgia is the most powerful potential candidate for the Senate seat should Mr. Talmadge step aside. But there are others, including Maynard Jackson, Mayor of Atlanta. Flood Case Continues Representative Daniel J. Flood has been hanging tough, seeking, and winning, re‐election last fall despite charges of bnberi, conspiracy and perjury. Last week, his trial under way in a Washington Federal District Court, the Pennsylvania Congressman made a concession to circumstances. He asked that he not be reappointed chairman of the appropriations subcommittee on 1::bor and health, education and welfare, but said he hoped to remain a member of t hat panel and defense subcommittce. In court, Mr. flood's lawyer a tricd to counter the testimony of Stephen B. Elko, a top aide to the Congressman until 1976 arid now his chief accuser. Mr. Elko has said that he frequently delivered payments to the Congressman from people seeking favors. Last week, a Pennsylvania banker asserted that Mr. Elko had sought money for himself, not for Mr. Flood, in connection with a bank merger deal. Connally Tosses In His Stetson With a hearty Hi‐Ho Silver, John 13. Connally rode into Washington last week and delivered a long‐expected announcement. He will seek the Republican Presidential nomination in 1980, and he will rely heavily on a magnetism’ that no one, least of all Mr. Connally. underestimates. The former Texas Governor packed the standard conservative ammunition. He said he favored a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced Federal budget except in emergencies, and a tough position against the Soviet Union. But on many matters Mr. Connally can properly be called pragmatic, reflecting a career that included tutelage under Lyndon B. Johnson, a stint as Treasury Secretary in the Nixon Administration, and, in 1973, conversion to Republicanism. This background, perhaps more than his trial and acquittal in the milkprice scandal in 1975, makes him suspect to many Republicans. Furthermore, although Mr. Connally has the aura of success in banking and the law, he has not run for office since 1966 and has no ready political base. Thus his emphasis in recent weeks on the importance of “charisma” (his word) in a Republican candidate, especially if — as he believes — the Democratic nominee turns out to be Senator Edward M. Kennedy. The strategy fits the “Big John” image, but it is also designed to separate him early from the pack he will face in the primaries. Mr. Connally said he thought the front‐runner was Ronald Reagan, who was also in Washington last week for frank discussions of his biggest apparent liability: he will be 69 years old before the first primary. Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada, who managed Mr. Reagan's 1976 campaign, said the issue was being laid open in meetings intended to show prominent Republicans that “you're not talking about a right‐wing nut with horns out of his ears — you're talking about a responsible conservative whose be a problem.” SALT H and the Panama Canal may be more glamorous treaties, but for stubborn complexity there's much to be said for the United States‐Canadian effort to agree on new offshore boundaries. The two Governments were faced with the task in 1977, when both extended their territorial limits to 200 miles offshore. The action created tangle of intersecting hypothetical lines, and overlapping claims to fishing and petroleum resources. Last week in Washington the two sides agreed in principle to submit the North Atlantic boundary issue to international adjudication. They also completed the framework of a treaty on one aspect of the dispute, fishing rights in the Georges Bank area, where a war of nerves has been going on for seven months between New England and Canadian fishermen. Last year's American catch on the Banks was valued at 154710 million. Neither Government is ready to disclose the details of the settlement. But any agreement is considered significant in a situation that has confounded diplomacy, geometry and grxxl intentions. The North Atlantic dispute is by no means all of it. On the West Coast, proposed agreement on the Puget Sound salmon fisheries has collapsed under the objections of Canadian fishermen. And there remains the battle over potential petroleum deposits at Dixon Entrance, at the southern tip of Alaska; and under the Beaufort S(.a, on the northern cowl of Alaska and the Yukon Territory. Horace Beckwith, a Fi.deral Bureau of Investigation supervisor implicated in illegal break‐ins and wiretappings, got a form of clemency last week, lie will be demoted and transferred from bureau headquartc r: to a field office. For Mr. Beckwith, that's an improvement; he had been facing dismissal and loss of his pension, less than three years from the retirement age of 50. Director William H. Webster relented because of Mr. Beckwith's “crucial” cooperation in a Justice Department investigation that led to the indictment of the former acting director, L. Patrick Gray, and two other former official;. Mr. Beckwith, who had been with Squad 47 in New York City, was one of four men selected for administrative discipline in the aftermath of the case. Two were censured and one other, Brian Murphy, was dismissed."
LONG ISLAND JOURNAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/28/archives/long-island-weekly-long-island-journal.html,"SOME residents of the North Shore continue to resist bus service, even if it's free. A group of businesses, including the Nassau Trust Company, Irwin Tantleff's Foodtown in Oyster Bay and Mark Ramirez's Pine Hollow Skating Rink, have been running free Wednesday bus service among East Norwich, Oyster Bay, Bayville, Locust Valley and Glen Cove on an experimental basis over the last three years to bring in more customers and improve business. It was hoped that more sponsors would become involved and defray the costs, according to Oyster Bay Town Councilman Howard T. Hogan Jr., who organized the idea in 1975 after the county eliminated municipal bus service in the area. “Economics has taken its toll,” he said, and the current sponsors can no longer continue to “carry the expense” beyond next Wednesday, the last day of the service. The cost of the project, he said, ran about $10,000 a year, but it never resulted in an increase of profits for any of the sponsors. However, he added, “It did provide the elderly and young people with a way of getting from place to place for a while.” • “Not since the Vietnam War has there been a more emotional issue among my constituents than the abortion debate,” said Representative John W. Wydler, Republican of Garden City. Nearly 200 voters from his Congressional district assembled in a committee room near his office on Capitol Hill last week to urge his support of an amendment that would “protect the unborn.” “I have had some difficulty in the past with some of the proposed human rights amendments,” Mr. Wydler said, “because I thought the wording would create serious legal problems.” “This is a sepsitive issue which the leadership of Congress should help to resolve by letting the prolife antiabortion group have their day in the arena,” he said. “A debate on the floor of the House would help clear the air of this endless throwing of amendments on every piece of legislation coming down the hill.” The 200 constituents were among group of nearly 4,000 Long Islanders who joined an estimated total of 60,000 abortion foes who participated in march on the White House and Capitol Hill. • Some of the Island's greatest em- ployment‐drawing potential may be the hundreds of acres of industrially zoned land adjacent to the State University at Stony Brook and the university's acting president, T. Alexander Pond, is preparing an inventory of the land and other sites for submission to state officials. The state, in turn, will use the inventory in its efforts to attract to the area high‐technology companies that would find the proximity to Stony Brook advantageous. John F. Burness, Dr. Pond's deputy, said that one large company had wanted to consolidate its research divisions on the Stony Brook campus itself but had to be told that this was not allowed. Mr. Burness noted that research concerns had tended to concentrate near university centers, such as those near Princeton, N.J. and Cambridge, Mass. Such arrangements, he said, were beneficial to both the university and the concerns, “providing useful interaction on a regular basis.” The most prized land for this purpose, he said, was 1,000 acres east of the Stony Brook Health Sciences Center and 325 acres to the west of the campus. • State Senator Carol Berman, who gained international attention as the leader of a coalition opposed to the landing of the British‐French Concorde at Kennedy International Airport, has made a gesture of a reconciliation. The first person she hired to staff her office in Albany was a Frenchwoman, Jacqueline Eason, who is now serving as a secretary. Senator Berman says she is not necessarily trying to make peace with the French Government on the Concorde issue, since “Jacqueline is a dedicated environmentalist who dislikes the SST just as much as those citizens of the Five Towns and Howard Beach area of Queens who staged so many demonstrations agains the noise supersonic craft.” It was those demonstrations that helped Senator Berman, a Democrat and resident of Lawrence, to win her election in the Ninth Senatorial District, which straddles the NassauQueens border and the noisy landing patterns at Kennedy Airport. • The City of Long Beach, which last summer drew Long Islanders and city dwellers to its cool beaches with boardwalk concerts and surf, sand and suntan contests, is pumping iron this winter. Not that it wants to kick sand in anyone's eye, but it is sponsoring the Junior and Senior Metropolitan A.A.U. Physique Contest on Feb. 10 at 8 P.M. at the Lindell School. The “guest poser,” according to Edwin Eaton, assistant city manager, will be Joe Nazzario, 1979 Mr. International. Mr. Eaton said that “aspiring greats” in a physical discipline recently revived by Arnold Schwarzenegger will participate in the event, sponsored by the Iron Power Club of Long Island and the West Head Youth Center of Long Beach, an active youth group that last summer helped city officials in their efforts to draw new crowds to the beaches and revive the city's economy. • FOLLOW‐UP: The Huntington Town Board voted last week to allow Huntington Hospital to expand its parking facilities. ■"
LETTERS TO THE CONNECTICUT EDITOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/28/archives/connecticut-weekly-letters-to-the-connecticut-editor-motherhood-and.html,"Joan Sillin's criticism of Joan Rice in the article “Pregnancy, Motherhood and Decisions” [Dec. 31] seemed totally irrelevant and unnecessary to me. Joan Rice, the subject of the article, was very happy with her pregnancy at the age of 43. Good for her. Why then did Joan Sillin find this an opportunity to jump on the Planned Parenthood bandwagon? Surely Planned Parenthood can find better material to work with. I respect Joan Sillin's opinion, but feel compelled to state my own opinion that destroying life conceived in the womb is wrong. Certainly that fetus has as much right to life as a 98-yearold in a nursing home. It seems to me that the moral values in our country must be reconstructed. • Rather than simply conceding that such things as “sexual abuse within the family” exist, why doesn't Planned Parenthood work on that? A fact that Joan Sillin overlooked in her plight for abortion is that all people in our country have the “inalienable right” to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. The abortion ruling abolishes those rights for both the father and the unborn child. Does Joan Sillin feel the father and the unborn child have no rights? Might the unborn child want to survive? The existing abortion law places the mother and physician as “supercitizens” and the father and unborn child as “subcitizens.” A system such as this is not a democracy. In conclusion, I surely hope Planned Parenthood can find better ways to improve American lives rather than criticize a happy 43-year-old pregnant, married woman. I was most interested in your recent article on the relationship between Connecticut arts organizations and corporations ['A Marriage of Convenience,” Dec. 3] which focused on the increased support that corporations and large businesses are lending to the performing arts of this state, as well as the influential ties which (it is inferred) some of these corporations are exercising on the arts. The Hartman Theatre in Stamford has been most fortunate in receiving help from many large corporations and businesses during its four‐year existence. Indeed, one of the best things about the assistance we receive from large corporations is that the companies have faith in the artistic product which the theatre presents and they have not attempted to exercise artistic control over our organization. It is this kind of unflinching support that builds a strong financial base for the nonprofit theatres in Connecticut, and allows us to continue to tread path where we present not only triedand‐true “classics,” but also new works that are experimental and thought‐provoking, and which represent the heart of the modern theatre movement in this country. The lead article in the Dec. 17 Connecticut Weekly about my brutality complaint to the New Canaan Police Commission covers well most aspects of the case. However, the following should be added. First, your statement that the issue is whether the hearing of my charges “was fair” presents only the narrow question. I am fighting for a much broader ruling - and am therefore making no monetary claims to determine whether any hearing of a civilian complaint against any public official can be fair if it is closed to the public. The lawyers opposing me represent not only the police union but also the entire Municipal Employees Union, A.F.L.C.I.O. Thus the issue reaches far beyond the borders of New Canaan and Connecticut. Naturally the union wants to preserve the closed‐hearing practice. Second, you fail to mention that my charges were backed up by a detective who observed the incident, reported that I was “struck,” and said that he did not see me grab for the sergeant's gun (as the latter claimed). The result has been the isolation of this detective, who was not at the recent crowded hearing before the Police Commission, whereas the police who supported his superior turned out in droves. If the case remains closed, and other complaints are similarly concealed from public scrutiny, the clear lesson for police and other public officials will be wreefold: See no evil within your department, act with immunity unless your wrongdoing is gross, and watch out for Deep Throat. In short, as James Madison said: “A popular government without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce or tragedy, or perhaps both.” A closedhearing on charges against a public official is both a farce and a tragedy. I respect Hans Haacke's views on the dangers of corporate financial support for the arts (Dec. 3). He is probably right in many respects. However, would like to suggest a way in which we may be able to have the best of both worlds - financial stability for arts organizations and artistic freedom for artists. My theory is that if government and industry • gave substantial support to the major producing organizations that is, enough money to opera, symphony, ballet and museums to give them a hungry but stable security from which they could achieve some rational planning - this would free the individual philanthropist to lend his support to the more innovative and controversial art projects. I realize that this runs the danger of relegating opera, symphony, ballet and museums to the category of staid old mausoleums of dead art, but I cannot believe that this is a clear and present danger, especially when you look at the innovative work going on in the theatres and opera houses of Europe, all of which are bankrolled by government. As matters stand now in the United States, millions of dollars of private money must be wheedled out of people's pockets every year to keep our best companies going, even when they play to full houses night after night. If those of us who care deeply about the performing arts were relieved of this incessant burden, I am convinced that it would produce a release of energy and money for controversial and even revolutionary art. in all its forms. wino” Linda C.

Telling Left From Right,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/28/archives/connecticut-weekly-telling-left-from-right-rating-the.html,"WASHINGTON CONNECTICUT'S senior Senator, Abraham Ribicoff, has slipped from a voting record of 90 percent “right” on liberal causes in the early 1970's all the way down to a 55 in 1978. At least that is what Americans for Democratic Action, the liberal‐minded lobbying group, figured out in issuing its latest report card on the way members of Congress vote. But if Mr. Ribicoff angered the A.D.A. by voting in 1978 for such measures as jet fighter sales to Egypt and Saudi Arabia as well as Israel, he did not please some conservatives much either. Americans for Constitutional Action, a very conservative national organization which opposes what it calls “the current massive movement of our na tion into socialism and a regimented society,” reported that Mr. Ribicoff voted “right” only 14 percent of the time on key issues last year. Even worse, according to the conservative group's rating system, Mr. Ribicoff's score since entering the Senate in 1963 is only 10 percent “right” on key issues. Organizations such as these two watch Congress closely, and pick out 20 or more key votes during the year before issuing report cards for Senators and Representatives. Obviously they differ sharply in defining what a right vote is. Connecticut's junior Senator, Lowell P. Weicker Jr., a Republican, started out his Senate career in the early 1970's with scores of 30's on the report card of Americans for Democratic Action, but last year he moved ahead of Mr. Ribicoff with a 60. His cumulative rating on the chart maintained by the conservative organization was 38, but last year he fell to a low, by the conservative group's standards, of only being right 20 percent of the time on key votes. How did Mr. Ribicoff fall so low in the estimation of the scorekeepers of the liberal organization? Arthur House, administrative assistContinued on Page 6 ant for Mr. Ribicoff, said that the Senator's “basic political philosophy hasn't changed that much” since the early 1970's. In fact he believes the A.D.A. Arguing that Americans for Democratic Action “used to be in favor of strong international posture for the United States,” Mr. House defended the Ribicoff vote on the proposal, endorsed by President Carter, for the jetplane sales, which were intended to achieve a balance in the Middle East. Senator Ribicoff, who is Jewish, was denounced by leading Jewish groups in the United States for his vote in favor of the plane sales, especially to Saudi Arabia. But he said at the time that his first duty was to vote as a United States Senator, and he noted provisions in the agreement that were designed to eliminate the attack capabilities of the planes sold to Saudi Arabia. Senator Weicker voted against the sales. Mr. House argues that “you can't draw profound lessons” from the A.D.A.'s method of keeping score. As a turning increasingly conservative in the last few years by the standards of Americans for Democratic Action. For example, in 1978, only 73 of the 435 members of the House and only 18 of the 100 Senators voted “right” as much as 70 percent of the time, according to the scorecards of the A.D.A. By its standards, these are low points in both houses of Congress in the last decade. On the question of whether Congress has changed or his organization is getting out of tune with the times, Leon Shull, national director of A.D.A., said that Congress had become “more conservative.” Members of Congress, Mr. Shull said, increasingly run independently of close party ties but are “highly subject to negative single‐issue groups” such as anti‐abortion advocates. Analyzing the case of Senator Ribicoff, Mr. Shull said that the high Ribicoff scores on A.D.A. report cards of the 1960's and early 1970's were a result of his votes in favor of major civil‐rights issues, including opposition to filibusters. “If those were big issues today,” he said, “Abe Ribicoff would still vote 100 percent the A.D.A. way.” But the big issues change, and now, according to Mr. Shull, “Senator Ribicoff has gone off the reservation by our standards because he supported Senator Long of Louisiana [chairman of the Senate Finance Committee] on tax matters, and Senator Long is in favor of the vested interests, especially oil Americans for Democratic Action graded members of Congress on 20 key votes, and two Ribicoff absences also cut the Senator's possible liberal score, because by the organization's standards, an absence is the same as an anti- liberal vote. As for Senator Weicker, “he's gotten more liberal, whatever the reason,” Mr. Shull said, adding that Mr. Weicker really never was “a wild man on the right.” Mr. Weicker has “got an carefully to the left,” Mr. Shull said. Among Connecticut's six members of the House of Representatives, Toby Moffett, three‐term Democrat from Unionville, has no competition as a high scorer on A.D.A.'s charts. Mr. Moffett, an advocate of pro‐consumer measures and a former lieutenant of his four years in Congress. By the conservative standards of the Americans for Constitutional Action, Mr. Moffett merited only a 16 percent score for his efforts in 1978 - still an improvement over his cumulative average of only 12 percent since he ent- Ronald A. Sarasin, the former Republican Representative from Beacon Falls, had the lowest score among Connecticut Congressmen in 1978 on the A.D.A.'s report card, receiving a 15. But he was highest on the conservative organization's list, although receiving only aa 58. Representative Christopher J. Dodd of North Stonington rates next to Mr. Moffett on the A.D.A. card, as the second most liberal Representative from Connecticut. Bunched around the 50-to60‐percent level are Representatives Robert N. Giaimo, Democrat of North Haven; Stewart B. McKinney, Republi- can of Fairfield, and William R. Cotter, Democrat of Hartford. Commenting on the liberal and conservative scorecards, Geoff Baker, erate by the numbers. He ranked in the middle of both groups.” Two of the key 1978 issues on which Senator Ribicoff voted “wrong,” according to Americans for Democratic Action, were his support of tax credits for private and parochial school tuition payments and his opposition to an amendment to reduce defense spending authorizations by $1.4 billion. Here are the report‐card scores of Connecticut members of the Senate and House over the past four years as recorded by the A.D.A.  (In 1973, Mr. Ribicoff had a 90 and Mr. Weicker a 55; in 1971 Mr.’ Ribicoff had a 93 and Mr. Weicker a 30).  (Americans for Constitutional Action scores available for 1978 are: Ribicoff, 14; Welcher, 20; Cotter, 28; Dodd, 8; Giaimo, 33; McKinney, 26; Sarasin, 58, and Moffett, 16. The group also lists the following cumulative scoresfor their entire careers in W : Ribicoff, 10; Weicker, 38; Cotter, 20; 11; Giaimo, 20; McKinney i 31; Sarasin, 49; and Moffett, 12)."
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/29/archives/letters-what-it-takes-to-sink-a-treaty.html,"Princeton, N.J., Jan. 20, 1979 The writer is McCormick Professor of Jurisprudence, emeritus, at Princeton University. In his letter of Jan. 15, Sidney Koretz questions Prof. Albert B. Saye's suggestion of Jan. 3 that the President enjoys unlimited authority to terminate a treaty. “Is termination an act of negotiation?” Mr. Koretz asks. The Supreme Court decision of 1926 in Myers v. United States sheds light on this. The Myers case raised the question whether the President has the exclusive power of removing executive officers of the United States whom he has appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. In 1876, Congress passed an act requiring Senate approval of the President's removal of persons appointed by him. In 1920 President Wilson fired Myers, a postmaster, in violation of that act. By a vote of 7 to 2, the Supreme Court, under Chief Justice Taft, himself a former President, declared the act unconstitutional. The Court distinguished between the constitutional requirement of the Senate's advice and consent to an appointment and a legislatively imposed Senate consent to removal. Said the Chief Justice: “The power to prevent removal of an officer who has served under the President is different from the authority to consent to or reject his appointment.... The power of removal is incident to the power of appointment, not to the power of advising and consenting to the appointment, and when the grant of the executive power is enforced by the express mandate to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, it emphasizes the necessity for including within the executive power as conferred the exclusive power of removal.” If the removal power is incident to appointment, may not termination of treaty be considered incident to negotiation? The fact that the Myers case involves internal rather than external affairs strengthens the case for President Carter's termination of the U.S. defense treaty with Taiwan. The President “makes treaties with the advice and consent of the Senate; but he alone negotiates. Into the field of negotiation the Senate cannot intrude; and Congress itself is powerless to invade it.” United States v. CurtissWright (1936). I am not insensitive to certain awesome implications. Suppose an avowed opponent of the Panama Canal Treaty were elected President in 1980: Could he alone terminate it? “... and you start finding excuses for failures. Macchiarola didn't do that” [news story Jan. 19]. Right on, Mayor Koch. After an im- Robert Neubecker pressive six months in office, the Chancellor has pointed a firm finger of blame for the city's education disaster at the teachers, of course. Now that he's found what others were too blind to see, I assume he will follow this amazing piece of deduction by formulating a plan whereby teachers can teach (rather than be constantly preoccupied with financial concerns, as he sees them). He will show us how classroom populations can shrink from 40 to 25; how the (nonteaching) mountain of paperwork can be overcome — or disappear. He will show us all the way that halls, washrooms and cafeterias can be patrolled without using teachers’ time for these tasks. He will, like Superman halting train, stop the cutbacks on physical plants and faculties (in the sacred name of the Balanced Budget) so all instructors can stop worrying about What to Do When the Ax Falls. He will see to it that U.F.T. contracts are no longer violated and put back all that pension fund money that bailed out New York City two years ago. Most spectacular of all, he will instantly enrich the minds of all 6th-to12th graders to make up for past neglect by the Board of Eduction, assuring that these students will now magically attain the math and reading skills needed to understand what's coming out of the teacher's mouth. As the wife of a New York City schoolteacher, I can hardly wait. MARIE BERLER Syosset, LA., Jan. 19, 1379 As one who was born and raised a Roman Catholic, I was deeply shocked by the response of Father Kenneth Jadoff, spokesman for the New York Archdiocese, to the protest of a group of clergymen, including Jewish clergy, against the church's position on abortion [news story Jan. 23]. To compare abortion in the 1970's to the Nazi holocaust is a grossly insensitive insult to the survivors, and relatives of victims, of the greatest known act of bestiality ever committed by man. Although I sympathize with those who oppose abortion, my many years of Roman Catholic education have taught me to reject the hair‐splitting, philosophical underpinnings for the church's opposition to abortion and birth control. But my most serious objection has been to the very kind of invalid moral equation made by Father Jadoff. The inability of church leaders to distinguish between the moral significance of such things as birth control, abortion and obscenity, and of such modern issues as the Vietnam War and racism are an example of moral myopia. Morality and ethics are born in the hearts of men, not in the metaphysical minds of scholastic philosophers. Men of true moral conscience know the difference between the genocide of millions of thinking, feeling men, women and children, and the termination of pregnancy. JOHN E. LEMOULT Riverside, Conn., Jan. 23, 1979 Now that the impact of the new Social Security tax is evident, many suggestions have been made to ease the burden of working people who are carrying the brunt of the new rates. There is one simple method of reducing costs: Remove from the pension rolls those who don't need the money. There are many persons who have ample income from other pensions and from investments, to whom the monthly check is nothing more than a tax‐free windfall. The system was created to keep people fed and sheltered in their old age, not for the purchase of luxuries. If a couple has a joint taxable income in excess of $35,000, they shouldn't be carried on the back of less fortunate working persons. They should have a Medicare deductible of $1,000 rather than the nominal amount used. Social Security payments are insurance against destitution. Would these people ask for a rebate on their fire insurance premiums if their home did not burn down? There are enormous savings possible, and no one would be hurt. BERNARD J. ROSEN Yonkers, Jan. 16, 1979 I read with considerable interest Robert Trumbull's recent article “Micronesia Accuses Its U.S. Trustee of Decades of Neglect.” Since the Department of the Interior is responsible for the administration of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, I made an official trip to the Marshal's, Truk and Ponape Districts last August to see firsthand what the United States has attempted to do in the area. While my trip was abruptly cut short by a plane crash en route to Ulithi Atoll, I was able to become familiar with general conditions in district centers and outlying islands and to appreciate the hard work the bulk of Americans and Micronesians have put into the development of Micronesia. The essential aim of the United States is self‐government for the peo- ple of Micronesia, and President Carter has announced a target date of 1981 for the termination of the current trusteeship. A large measure of selfgovernment already exists in the trust territory. Almost all of the top positions in the administration are occupied by Micronesians. The district administrators are Micronesians. Threc districts and the Northern Mariana already have elected governors as thr chief executives of their local governments. I do not contest the criticism by local Micronesian officials of past U.S. Administrations’ practices and policy, particularly regarding slow economic development. There is no question that in the past the major emphasis was on development of education and social services for the area. What is not noted is that these essen- tial services did not exist to any appreciable extent at the beginning of the trusteeship for the Micronesian people. The United States as administering authority had to build up an entire system of education and to install a basic health service and other social services. Without a pool of educated, healthy people, economic development would not mean much. The article also neglects to point out that a large‐scale capital improvement program was launched by the United States. By 1981 a basic infrastructure system of new docks, harbors, airfields, water systems and reliable power generation facilities will be constructed in the district centers. Upon completion, approximately $206 million will have been invested in these basic facilities. Without such an infrastructure there can be no meaningful economic development in Micronesia. With it in place, the newly emerging governments will be able to intensify their efforts to develop greater local self-sufficiency. Much of the physical appearance of the developing urban areas around the district centers leaves a great deal to be desired. However, short of providing total physical facilities, i.e., housing for all families who move to urban areas and modern commercial and governmental buildings, “tin roofs” will be part of the way of life in the Pacific for a long time. Mr. Trumbull's recent book on the South Pacific, “Tin Roofs and Palm trees,” highlights this as a common phenomenon in newly emergent countries of the Pacific area. There are still many things to be done in Micronesia before achieving the self‐government goal. Building on what has already occurred, this Administration accepts the challenge of completing this trusteeship as responsible Stewards of the Micronesian peo- ple. JAMES A. JOSEPH Under Secretary U S. Department of the Interior Washington. Jan. 17. 1979 We concur with your recent editorial concerning the chancellor of the City University of New York, Dr. Robert J. Kibbee, and we share your concern at the Governor's alleged intention to become directly involved in the determination of CUNY's leadership. The Legislature of the State of New York has recognized “the unique function and mission” of CUNY. The Legislature stated unequivocally that CUNY “has made and continues to make an important, indispensable contribution” with “economic, social and cultural value to all the citizens of the State of New York which are unsurpassed by any other city‐based collegiate institution in the nation.” (Emphases added ) In addition, Governor Carey has been and continues to be, a staunch supporter of the City University and is committed to increased state funding for CUNY. The Governor is to be lauded for this position. Unfortunately, these views are currently being clouded by newspaper reports about changing the top level of CUNY's administration. Interference with academic matters would be both inappropriate and counterproductive. Professional educators and university trustees are the proper assessors of academic performance. Political leaders have a role in the appointment of distinguished men and women as trustees of the university and in the appropriation of adequate funds to carry out the mission of the university, as directed by the trustees and their appointed administrators and faculty. Dr. Kibbee has been chancellor of CUNY during an era of significant change in our city and state and has been evaluated by nationally recognized educators. Their positive evaluation is now a matter of record. We urge—and trust — that the Gov- error, the Legislature and the May will continue their deliberations regarding CUNY, with no other agenda than the appointment of outstanding citizens to the Board of Higher Education and the rational and supportive funding of the City University, so that it may continue to serve the citizens of New York with distinction. In our view, the retention of the chancellor of CUNY, Dr. Robert Kib bee, should be a matter of deliberation by a reconstituted Board of Higher Education in an area free of political interference.

U.S. Catholics Finding Bearings After a Long Period of Upheaval,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/29/archives/us-catholics-finding-bearings-after-a-long-period-of-upheaval.html,"No region within the domain of Pope John Paul II more closely reflects the tensions, disarray and opportunities of modern Catholicism than the church in the United States. American Catholics have experienced an upheaval in their reli- Second of two articles. gious life that in some respects was as overwhelming and complex as the social and political changes in temporal life since the early 1960's. The church in Latin America, where the Pope is attending a conference of bishops in Mexico, presents the most pressing social agenda. The Pope has stressed to priests and nuns there the idea that their job is to evangelize rather than to engage in political activism. And the outcome of the church's efforts to attack social problems in Latin America may depend to a great degree on the ability of the church in the United States to achieve stability and a clear sense of pur- pose. Fifteen years ago, the church appeared, on the surface at least, to be rocklike center in the lives of one out of every four Americans. Since then, it has undergone profound change, tearing millions of Catholics from familiar moorings. But there is evidence that the church has begun to emerge from its darkest period of perplexity, that hopeful new ways are being explored to deal with the continuing challenges and build a new community of faith that is more tolerant of diversity and dissent than the old church that spoke with one voice. “We're in the midst of a period of Catholic history that could be as significant as the reform periods of the 16th and 17th centuries,” said Dr. Jay P. Dolan, historian and former priest who directs the Center for the Study of American Catholicism at the University of Notre Dame. “It is not beyond the realm of possibility that by the end of the century Catholics may adopt the Anglican model of high and low church, or even split into three branches like Orthodox, Conservative and Reform Jews.” The eventual outcome of this period of change in the church is less than certain, and the transition period has claimed many casualties —.those who believe the church has changed too much and those who believe it has not changed enough. But it does seem clear that the church can not return to its former role for most of its members, that it can only hope to assume an equally important, though different, role. Progress is being made in democratizing the church and broadening the role of the laity in all church affairs, a shift urged by the Second Vatican Council, the 1962‐1965 conclave in Rome that indelibly changed the structure and tone of Roman Catholicism. Talks with American Catholics, both lay and clerical, produce a wide‐ranging set of views on nearly every major issue facing the church today, and an indication of the tolerance, even encouragement, of diverse thinking in church ranks. Catholics are not exactly sanguine about the future of the church, but many are modestly confident. There is a widespread feeling that the church's lowest point was passed about four or five years ago, when statistical data reflecting the vitality of church practice hit the lowest level in modern times, with attendance at mass falling off precipitously and the recruitment of young men for the priesthood reaping a critically meager harvest. Moreover, there is a new sense of wellbeing among Catholics, in part because of dramatic shifts in their social and economic situations that took place in conjunction with the reforms of Vatican II. The bulk of Catholics in the past generation have broken out of the old parish neighborhoods of the industrial Northeast and Midwest and have joined the mainstream of life in America, from the suburbs to the Sun Belt to the board rooms of corporations to the inner circles of country clubs. Income levels increased with educational achievement, and Catholics, as group, now outrank Protestants in both categories for the first time. The uprooting of families, their dispersal in a mobile society, the new affluence and materialism — all work to challenge the faith's older adaptations to an immigrant culture. Further, when Vatican II modernized church ritual and structure, eliminating such cornerstones of the faith as the 16th century Latin mass and meatless Fridays, some Catholics at first felt they had been deprived of a deep, intimate part of their religion. Hard upon those changes came Vietnam and Watergate and a chastening of the American spirit, accompanied by loss of confidence in most institutions, temporal and spiritual. At the same time, the church, along with the rest of the nation, had to deal with the sexual revolution, the changing American family, skyrocketing divorce rates and a host of other tensions. The church took its losses, braced itself as millions of Catholics reassessed their own personal spiritual needs, and in recent years has begun a slow, often painful process of recovery. A mood of uplift can be sensed among Catholic charismatics during prayer meetings, among churchgoers warmly exchanging the “kiss of peace” during mass, and among members of the laity volunteering to distribute communion wafers as “extraordinary ministers of the Eucharist.” It is also visible in the church's initiatives in behalf of social justice and in tending to its newest immigrant members, the Hispanic people flooding into inner‐city churches in such places as Los Angeles, San Antonio and New York. Undergirding these random expressions is a new sense of pride in being Catholic, as much a part of the individual• who may attend mass only at Christmas as it is of the person bowed daily in devotion. It is the attitude that Catholic culture, tradition and heritage are celebrations of life despite continuing controversy over ritual and exactitude of belief. The election of the new Pope, the first non‐Italian pontiff in 953 years, appears to have strengthened this pride by giving the church a leader who symbolizes its universality and speaks forthrightly on modern issues, though resisting some modern ideas. “I contend that the church has never been stronger, just as it has emerged stronger out of every major conflict in the past 2,000 years,” said Archbishop John R. Quinn of San Francisco, president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. The church's conflicts of the past, growing out of the debates that followed its ascent as a world moral force, took place in ages of belief. The current changes take place in a secular age, and in Western societies are being debated not just among the clergy but also among an educated laity. It is not certain just how quickly the church in America can rebound from what Archbishop Jean Jadot. who as the apostolic delegate to the United States is the Pope's liaison in this country, calls the “paroxysms of tension.” “When things never accepted 20 years ago, like abortion and sterilization, are commonplace today, we can never go back to the church of the 1950's,” the Belgian‐born. prelate said in an interview at his residence in Washington. “The church's value system is much more different than the values of society, not because we change so much, but because society is changing greatly.” Better‐educated Catholics are less likely to accept church teachings, even on such clear‐cut matters as birth control. Significantly, these decisions are being made by millions of Americans who think Of themselves as loyal Catholics even when they are at odds with some church stands. A Gallup survey for the Catholic Press Association, released last spring, notes, for example, that those members with college degrees are increasingly likely to reject church teachings on such issues as abortion but are less inclined than in the past to abandon Catholicism as a result. Open dissent reached a crescendo at a 1976 “Call to Action” conference in Detroit, authorized by the American church hierarchy in connection with the national church's attempt to formulate a social action program at the time of the Bicentennial. The three‐day meeting was the culmination of the broadest effort in the American church's history to determine the desires and priorities of members. When it was over, the 1,340 participants had recommended dozens of proposals, most related to basic issues such as Catholic family life, but others highly controversial, such as those urging the ordination of women as priests and an end to mandatory celibacy. While the bishops eventually dismissed the most debatable of these proposals, the event underscored the striking differences that have taken root. The trend toward individualism and dissent worries many in the church because it suggests a lack of common belief and a breakdown of tradition. Others are convinced that pluralism is not only inevitable but healthy, if not carried too far. Both sides agree, however, that fewer Catholics look to parish priest, bishop or Pope to decide matters of conscience. “Young Catholics to6y don't have any notion that they reject the Pope's authority, simply because they don't pay any attention to him in the first place,” said the Rev. James Burtcharell, professor of theology and former provost at Notre Dame University. “Like any other Americans, they view the Pope as a personality, not as an authority. If he's a nice guy, fine. But they don't feel a great need of him; they don't look to him for guidance on issues such as birth control.” Or, in the words of the Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, president of Notre Dame: “Catholics now understand that the church is not the papacy.” By defining the church as primarily the “people of God” rather than an institution, Vatican II gave legitimacy to such views. Authority, the Council declared, must be shared to a much greater degree than in the past. “The popes have gotten by for more than a century without speaking ex cathedra,” said Father Hesburgh, alluding to the use of infallible, divinely inspired edicts. “We have a lot of terribly complicated questions that can't be solved with a snap of the fingers: test‐tube babies. cloning and abortion. I don't think there will be any more thunderbolts of doctrine from Rome, because people now know that you can disagree with the Pope and not go to hell or lose your faith.” South Bend, Ind., where Notre Dame functions as the academic citadel of the nation's Catholicism, also bears witness to the ecstatic, exuberant side of the faith that has burgeoned recently under the heading of the charismatic movement. Dozens of followers of this movement, which emphasizes such “gifts of the spirit” as healing and praying in tongues, bought and now occupy a blocklong building downtown. By stressing spontaneity and outpouring of emotion, these Catholics, estimated to number at least a half‐million, have added another element to church pluralism and debate. Detractors claim that the movement sets up a kind of Catholic “born again” elitism that ignores proper order and overly emphasizes personal salvation. But many have found renewal in within it. “When my two sons were sick. thought I was having a nervous break‘ down,” recalled a 48-year-old Brooklyn woman. She started attending charismatic services in private homes and “was filled with the spirit of the Lord in way 1 never felt before.” The call for spiritual renewal that is voiced by charismatic groups is received sympathetically even by many critics. Most recognize the need to try to counteract the severe losses of churchgoers that began shortly after the end of Vatican II in 1965. In the period between 1954 and 1976, the percentage of Catholics who attended mass at least once a week fell from 71 percent to 55 percent, according to G'1iup polls. A precipitous decline in the sacrament of confession took place in the same period. Some considered the drop a backlash against Vatican II which, among other things, allowed mass in English, lay clothes for nuns and the eating of meat on Fridays, and officially abandoned the position that Catholicism represented “the one true church.” But the most extensive recent study of Catholic attitudes, conducted by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago under the direction of the Rev. Andrew M. Greeley, concluded that most of the defections were caused by the 1968 encyclical, “Humanae Vitae,” in which Pope Paul VI reaffirmed the church's opposition to artificial birth control. Other studies show that Catholics’ use of contraceptives is nearly equal to that in the rest of society. Three‐fourths of the Catholics surveyed by Father Greeley endorsed changes instituted by Vatican II and strongly supported Catholic schools. Modernization, Father Greeley insists, has held Catholics who might otherwise have deserted the church. “I love the folk masses, and even some of the rock music,” said Marina Herrara, 36, a divorced mother of six in Kansas City, Mo. “What's important is that people can say what they feel, communicate with God in their own way.” Mass attendance has held steady over the past five years, and the Gallup fig- ures show even a slight increase in the rate of weekly attendance by Catholics under 30 in the last two years. But at least one out of five of the nation's Catholics is so alienated as to be considered “unchurched,” the poll showed, and in response the church has begun a massive evangelism project to win them back. Among the disaffected are Catholics who may feel emotionally close to the church but who regard its changes with anger, resentment ‘or feelings of betrayal. They tend to be younger than 50, with one leg figuratively in the old church and one in the new. For this group, the “opening of the windows” symbolized by Vatican II, which was meant to signal the ventilating of a church grown musty with age, provided an exit. In taking a more aggressive approach, the church is conceding that it can no longer carry on by sheer momentum and that it is in competition with. various ideologies. The revised National Catechetical Directory, which provides the basic guidelines for Catholic education, for example, is expressly written for those whose faith may be shaky. Another indication of church sensitivity to the “unchurched” is an effort to elevate men to the hierarchy who exhibit qualities that are referred to as “pastoral,” in contrast to “administrative.” Under the watchful, discerning eye of Archbishop Jadot, who plays a key role in selecting candidates, appointments in recent years have tended to go to men who listen carefully and extend compassion to those, such as the mushrooming numbers of divorced Catholics, who disagree with church teaching. The pastoral image became central in the traits preferred in the choosing of the new Popes this ‘past fall. It also appears to meet a need among the nonchurchgoers. A major Gallup poll earlier this year compared the “churched” with the “unchurched” and found relatively little difference in patterns of belief but a division in their views toward organized religion. More than half of the “unchurched” said they would return to church under certain conditions, such as finding a clergymanthey could confide in or a church where people were friendly. Meanwhile, among those who never left the church there are signs of heightened spirituality and exuberance. Last year, for instance, the number of “houses of prayer,” where members of the laity go for spiritual retreats, increased by 25 percent. Three thousand laymen are now serving as ordained deacons, the step that precedes entrance into the priesthood, performing such functions of the ministry as visiting the sick and, occasionally, conducting baptisms and funerals. Vatican II placed emphasis on upgrading the role of deacon by giving it a conspicuous place. A deacon undergoes several months of training and is not required to pledge himself to celibacy. By occupation, they range from bricklayers to lawyers The faithful are generally being urged to take more responsibility. Lay councils and lay ministers are moving into areas of parish control that previously had been the exclusive domain of priests. Parish finances and administration are increasingly placed in the hands of lay members, as are some counseling services. Church members are also sharing iri liturgical duties during the mass, often reading Scripture and parts of the liturgy. “I believe the Holy Ghost is holding gun to the head of the church and insisting that we use the laity,” said the Rev. Alvin Illig, who is heading the national evangelistic project. Like many other leaders, he looks to the laity rather than the clergy to do the basic job of bringing the faith to non‐Catholics. As Catholics have tasted more freedom, asserted more authority and debated changes more vigorously, it has become more difficult to classify them simply as Catholics. There are traditionalists who take a dim view of many Vatican II reforms, and those who feel just as strongly that the church has not moved fast enough to meet the challenges of the modern world. Distinct forms of parish life are already evident as priests and parishioners make use of the various choices in liturgy. One parish may offer guitar masses, another the revised Latin mass and still another a mass for charismatics. Cathcilics once were expected to go to church in the parish where they lived, but many now travel some distance to attend church they like. “Our parents were educated to believe the church never changed,” said Mary Hawley, a junior studying theology at Notre Dame. “But to my generation seems all the church does do is change.” The focus of much of this change is‐the parish rather than diocesan headquarters, and that is placing new expectations on priests. “The local parish is now the base for initiatives instead of the chancery office,” said the Rev. Philip Murnion of the office of pastoral research in the Archdiocese of New York. “Everyone is now looking for new models to deal with small groups inside the parish to reflect on fundamental values, and provide people with direction in their lives.” “It's a style that requires a new confidence among the priests,” he continued. “Not all priests are prepared to handle it. The big problem is that a vertically structured church has been made horizontal almost without preparation.” A related problem, one with vast repercussions, is the likelihood that there will be far fewer priests to take on such assignments in the future. In the last decade, the decline in numbers of men studying for the priesthood has been stunning — nothing less than “catastrophic,” according to an editorial in a publication of the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate. And because the Catholic population has grown over the decade and has migrated increasingly to the Sun Belt, where there are fewer Catholic institutional resources, there are fewer priests Per capita covering much more ground. The actual number of priests has remained fairly stable over the last 10 years — 59,803 in 1968 as against 58,485 last year — but the number of seminarians has plummeted from 40,000 to 15,000 in the same period. Recruitment has inched up some since 1974, when it hit bottom. The condition of women's religious orders is even more alarming to many Catholics. Ten years ago it was estimated that there were 176,671 women in 360 orders in this country. By last year, the number had fallen to 130,804. A conference on women's ordination last November brought the drive to its most militant stage. Pope Paul VI officially ruled out the possibility of women as priests, but scores of American women, many of them with theological training, are keeping the issue alive. Following the ordination conference, several of the women confronted the bishops at their regular meeting in Washington and won a commitment to discuss the role of women in the church. Hispanic Catholics, entering the nation at a rate of about two million a year, also are demanding new responses from the church. They now account for 27 percent of all American Catholics and their influence is mounting. From Southern California, where most are Mexican‐Americans, to Miami with its large bloc of CubanAmericans and New York with its growing numbers of Puerto Ricans and immigrants from Central America, large problems are posed by a group of people whose faith is often strong but whose social and economic needs are great. A wave of activism has swept Hispanic communities in recent years, resulting it demands both for social justice and for better treatment by the church. They consider the church's record mixed. The church has won credit by pressing for liberalized laws on illegal aliens, for helping Cesar Chavez organize the United Farm Workers union and for aiding the strike in Texas against the Farah textile company, whose work force is largely Hispanic. But many Hispanic Catholics are also sharply critical of church policies and attitudes that they regard as racist. There have been calls for greater efforts to promote Hispanic men and women to leadership positions in the church and for attempts to crack what some see as racial barriers separating them, as poor urban dwellers, from the ranks of affluent Catholic suburbanites. As a consequence of these feelings of neglect, more and more Hispanic people have been attracted to Protestant Pentecostalism and its friendship, outlet for free expression of spirituality and emotion. and intimate, informal style of worship. Church officials are openly concerned. At the November bishops’ meeting, the hierarchy listened to a careful explanation of this development and began considering how to respond. “To adequately serve the Hispanic community is a gigantic task,” said Bishop Juan Arzube, vicar to the Spanishspeaking in the Los Angeles archdiocese. where Hispanic people are 70 percent of the two million registered Catholics. “A lot remains to he done, but we must not lose sight of the fact that a lot has been accomplished. Ten years ago there were no Hispanic bishops in the United States. Today there are eight.” Hispanic Catholics also feel that their spirituality, based more in the home than in the church, has much to offer a church that is looking to deepen prayer and worship In addition, they are restless, asking for better treatment from betterheeled Catholics, whose immigrant forebears faced some of the same difficulties. Hispanic Catholics are virtually certain to gradually move closer to the church's mainstream and to add significantly to its expanding pluralism. While it is becoming more difficult to categorize Catholics by a single set of definitions outside common faith allegiance, it also appears more certain that Catholics will be more comfortable with the vanety of views and practices within their church. Father Greeley refers to the emergence of a “communal Catholic,” one who retains his self‐image as a Catholic while rejecting some of the church's teachings. Many Catholics believe that as Catholic views grow more complex, such a characterization will become even more applicable.

Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/30/archives/letters-the-stubborn-virus-of-racial-bigotry-2-myths-about-3.html,"U.S. Senator from Wisconsin Washington, Jan . 26,1979 To the Editor The Jan. 15 Op‐Ed article by Robert Hilldrup saddened me greatly be cause, whatever may have been its in tention, the end result was to cast aspersions at the many for the sins of few. Is this not the genesis of all racial religious or ethnic bias? As I read the article, I found the basest part of my mentality nodding in agreement as the author rattled off the petty crimes and misdemeanors of some blacks that had led to the anti black bias of his children. Then I thought of all my own personal con, tacts with blacks. I have been on the boards of directors of several organizations devoted to improving the lot of minorities, and from 1970 to 1972 I served as president of the Union County Urban League. I have worked with and met hundreds of black people in all walks of life. Overwhelmingly, they have been ordinary, hard-working people trying to make ends meet like the rest of us, and therefore no bet ter, and certainly no worse, than the white majority. If the author's children see aberrant behavior as being the exclusive prov ince of blacks, I suggest it is because his children have been, perhaps unconsciously, infected with the virus of racial bigotry that still haunts much of the world. What amazes me is that in spite of pervasive attempts to convince black people of their supposed inferiority, most manage to contain their sorrow or anger and simply go about the business of living. While it is true that America has made considerable strides in legislating equality of treatment in areas of education and public accommodation, the job market for young black people is almost nonexistent. This, coupled with the fact that large numbers of us have not learned to ignore skin color in our thoughts and everyday contacts with our black brethren, makes for a poten- tially explosive situation. In spite of endemic hopelessness in substantial segments of the black community only a small minority of blacks engage in serious antisocial or criminal behavior If Mr. Hilldrup's children answer that I don't know what I'm talking about, never having experienced black antisocial behavior firsthand, they're mistaken. I have been a volunteer probation counselor since 1972 and have worked with numerous children and young adults of both races. I got to like just about every kid assigned to me, and I can truthfully say that race had nothing o do with the type of offense cornmired or the offender's response to being counseled. The sum of my experiences has merely confirmed my lifelong belief that we are all brothers, bound together by our common hu- KENNETH L. BIRO manity. Maplewood, N.J., Jan. 24,1979 2 ‘Myths’ About 3 Percent for NATO To the Editor. Your Jan. 26 editorial “The ‘Gunsor‐Butter’ Trap” would be more convincing if it did not rest on two obvious myths. The first is that the Warsaw Pact forces in Central Europe have so improved “that a dangerous disequilibrium is developing.” Actually, the facts demonstrate the opposite. According to C.I.A. and D.I.A. testimony before the Joint Economic Committee, the significant Soviet buildup has been on the Chinese border rather than in Eastern Europe. Soviet troop strength on the eastern front has gone up sharply, from 400,000 in 1969 to 650,000 in 1978, or 63 percent, while Moscow added only 13 percent on the western front. While it is true that the Soviet Union is strengthening its forces in Europe, so has the United States, and the relative improvement has favored the West, not the Warsaw Pact. Soviet tanks in Europe are more numerous, but NATO tanks are ‘of superior quality, and we also lead in both quantity and quality of antitank weapons. Warsaw Pact nations enjoy a small advantage in numbers of tactical aircraft, but NATO aircraft are far superior in quality and numbers available for attack missions. The second myth is that the 3 percent budget increase contributes to NATO defense and thus can be justified. Nothing could be further from the truth. Consider that $1.2 billion of that socalled NATO 3 percent contribution represents an increase in retired military pay. How does that contribute to the defense of NATO? And yet it is part of the overall 3 percent increase. The same could be said of military manpower not associated with Europe. If NATO defense were a sound justification, then the budget should reflect increases in those areas dedicated to NATO — not an overall 3 percent in totally unrelated programs. Finally, it should be noted that the 3 percent figure misrepresents the real increase in outlays since it compares fiscal year 1979 plus a $4.4 billion supplemental with the fiscal year 1980 totals. The $4.4 billion has not been approved by Congress. That means any comparison is artificially low. If we dismiss the supplemental, except for the planned pay increase, then the real increase in this budget is 4.4 percent—much higher than the Administration is claiming. The strength of this rationale becomes evident when it is understood that the $4.4 billion supplemental would break the Congressional budget ceiling set for last year WILLIAM PROXMIRE To the Editor: Judge Kaufman of the U. S. Court of Appeals in a Jan. 16 Op‐Ed article opposes legislation pending before Congress for the creation of a commission which would have the power to remove Federal judges for incompetency. He states that “if a judge overstays his period of useful service, his colleagues manage the problem effectively in a personal and informal manner.” Cover‐ups anywhere in government, however well intentioned, should not be condoned; the admitted existence of such cover‐ups mandates enactment of the legislation — with appropriate safeguards against possibilities SAMUEL L. NADLER of harassment. Floral Park, N.Y., Jan. 19, 1979 ‘I Resent Being Called The Abortionist’ To the Editor: United States Supreme Court Justice Byron White was quoted in a recent minority opinion regarding the Pennsylvania law dealing with the sustenance of an aborted fetus as dencribing a person who performs an abortion as “the abortionist.” As a physician who performs many types of gynecological surgery, including abortions, I resent being called the abortionist by anyone and find the term especially odious coming from a Justice of our highest court. The term abortionist has a derogatory connotat ion — a relic of the past when elective abortions were performed in the “back alleys” by individuals who were not physicians. Either Mr. Justice White is ignorant of proper medical terminology or he has allowed (either consciously or otherwise) his prejudices in this case to seep into what should be a responsible dissent. Even giving him the benefit of the doubt, I believe he awes the medical Profession an apology. MARVIN A. ROSNER. M.D. Chicago, Jan. 22, 1979 Time for City Planning to Move to City Hall To the Editor: In reference to your Jan. 15 editorial on the City Planning Commission and the need for professionalism, perhaps the time has come for change. As noted by a state‐city fiscal relations committee (1956), in a dynamic and complex city no system “devised at one time can have permanent and flexible durability,” and “as needs and conditions emerge and change, arrangements for meeting them must also change.” The planning function is in its second evolutionary stage, the first stage having been a function of the private civic organizations, and the second, an independent, autonomous commission, above politics and with special expertise, serving as an interpreter of plans and as a buffer between people and government — Rexford Tugwell's “fourth power.” Your editorial speaks to this second stage, particularly to “expertise” and an ethic “above politics.” It skillfully destroys these criteria as myths vis-àvis the independent planning body. As for its buffer role, the history of the commission may well be written in confrontation with the community people. As for its role as interpreter of plans, few long‐range plans have been prepared to interpret to the public. As for independence, we are not overwhelmed by the times the commission has asserted independence against the wishes of a mayor. As for autonomy, urbanologists have noted that autonomy leads to nonaccountability and often thwarts the democratic process. The City Planning Commission has guided the planning function through its infancy. It is now time for the third stage: the elimination of the commission and the placing of the planning function directly within government —a professional function in the office of the mayor. This will enable the planners to deal with the broadest range of problems and with the interactions and interrelationships among systems and people; it will enable them to come up with realistic solutions. Most important, we shall be able to hold our elected officials accountable. BEVERLY MOSS SPATT Brooklyn, Jan. 22, 1979 To the Editor: John Kenneth Galbraith claims that price controls “held prices nearly stable through the vast convulsion of World War II” and “decisively broke the inflationary spiral in the Korean War” [Op‐Ed Jan. 12]. That is misleading, if not deceptive. Price controls did seem to hold measured price increases down in 1944 and 1945, but that was mainly because the price indexes simply ignored black markets. Production of autos and many other consumer durables was also banned after 1942, so prices of such goods were not really the fictional prewar prices that went into the price indexes but were instead closer to infinity. Subsidies to producers were really price increases paid by taxes, so that too distorted measured price increases. In any case, the pent‐up demands and stored liquidity of the control period resulted in a 15.5 percent inflation in 1946 (when controls literally blew apart in April) and 13.8 percent in 1947. Even with all the measurement problems, average inflation in World War II clearly exceeded 7 percent a year. The 1950‐51 buying spree and burst of inflation can plausibly he attributed to fear of wartime controls and short ages. but the subsequent reduction of inflation had nothing to do with controls. Wholesale prices actually fell 3.4 percent in 1952 and consumer food prices fell 1.1 percent. Limits on price The Times welcomes letters from readers.

In fact, fiscal and. monetary policy turned sharply restrictive, with the budget showing a surplus in calendar 1952‐55 and growth in the money supply slowing to 1 percent in 1952. Controls were simply redundant long before they were scrapped in April 1953. Professor Galbraith's analysis is as flawed as his history. Blaming inflation on big corporations and unions might make sense only if they had suddenly sprung up in the past decade. which is demonstrably untrue. Treating monetary policy as something separate from a slowdown of either public or private spending makes no sense at all. The idea that all $400 billion in Federal non‐defense spending really benefits about six million poor people is disingenuous or naive (if true, the poor would be rich). And the claim that “a very modest increase in taxes” on “fewer than five million tax- payers” would materially affect inflation is promising mountains from molehills. Another tax increase on “the affluent” might well have no effect on total spending (unless the Government stuck the hoped‐for tax proceeds in a mattress), but it could easily provoke tax rebellion and semiretirement among productive double‐earner families that have already been inflated into astronomical Federal‐state tax brackets. Never mind, says Galbraith. “the revolt of the affluent” (defined as families earning over $30,000) “is not a violent thing.” When political officials are openly counseled to ignore nonviolent rumblings of discontent, we must be losing our grip on the foundations of responsible representative govern- ALAN REYNOLDS ment."
Birth‐Defect Suits Worry Doctors,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/30/archives/birthdefect-suits-worry-doctors-requested-counseling.html,"ARECENT New York Court of Appeals ruling that held physicians liable in certain circumstances for the lifetime care of children born with some disorders has been applauded by geneticists and consumer groups, but has sent shivers through the medical profession, particularly among obstetricians. The ruling said that doctors can be held liable for the special cost of life time care if they did not adequately advise Pregnant women who later bort children with defects that could have been foreseen or detected. The required advice concerns the availability of genetic testing and counselling ‐discussing the risk of having a child with such a disorder. The decision, handed down last month by the state's highest court, was seen by consumer advocates as a new opportunity for patients to participate in decisions that affect their lives and families.

Amniocentesis testing can detect about 60 hereditary disorders. The procedure involves withdrawal of a sample of amniotic fluid from the uterus of the expectant mother with a hypodermic needle guided by ultrasound mine if the fetus had the disorder. The woman gave birth to a girl affected by Down's Syndrome. The seeond case involved a woman whose first baby was born in 1969 wtth a disorder called polycystic kidney disease. She asked her doctor if it could happen again, and he said the chances were “practically nil,” according to the ruling. In 1970. however, she bore a second child with the drsorder. That child lived two‐and‐a‐half years. The ruling comes at a time of increasing emphasis on preventive medicine and after medical genetics has generated new opportunities for prevention. 2,000 Diseases Known Knowledge about hereditary diseases and birth defects has mushroomed to the point where doctors have learned that the number of genetic dis easesexceeds 2,000, according to the National Genetics Foundation. About one‐third of admissions to some pediatrichospitals result from genetic diseases. By examining old medical records. taking extensive medical h1stories from the parents and their blood relativesand performing a variety of tests. medical geneticists can calculate the risk that a couple will have a child affectedwith a particular condition. Further, doctors have made tremendousgains in developing tests to detect hereditary conditions m the early stages of pregnancy, when abortions can be performed safely. Many chromosomal defects such as Down's Syndrome can be detected by tests performedin conjunction with am?iocen tests, in which a thin needls, guided by ultrasound.

Calculations Necessary But because am?ocentests testing can defect relattvely few of the known hereditary conditions, genetic counseling has to rely on calculations from the medical histories to advise parents about the risk of bearing defective children. Because amniocentests has received widespread publicity, many women are aware that it may offer them some assurance that they will not bear children with genetic defects. One of the most publicized of these defects is Down's Syndrome. The risk of bearing a Down's Syndrome child rises sharply at about age 40. The risk under the age 30 is one in 1,500. according to the United States Public Health Service, rising to one in 280 between the ages of 35 and 39 and to one in 130 between 40 and 44. Beyond the age of 45, the Federal statistics p?t the at one in 65. However, obstetricians are concerned that public discussion of the amnicentests procedure has tended to minimize its hazards. In unusual circumstances, the needle can damage the fetus or lead to miscarrianges or bleeding. Doctors contend that a ruling like that recently handed down by the Court of Appeals can put them in an impossible situation because of uncertainty over the age at which it is recommended and the risks it involves. When amniocentests was developed. Some doctors expressed doubts about its safety. A study of the procedure was begun in 1971 at 10 medical centers around the country, the results were published in late 1976, two years after the case of Down's Syndrome involved in the court ruling. However, in a report in the current issue of The New England Journal of Medicine researchers at the University of California in San Francisco who conducted the largest amniocentests study of its kind — an evaluation of procedure “safe highly reliable and extremely accurete.” Dr. ??? who practiced obst??trices in poughkeepsie linked the situation created by the new ruling to that surrounding D.E.S. a drug that, until a few years ago, was commonly prescribed in the belief that it would reduce the number of miscarriages. Only recently has it become known that D.E.S. can cause in some females born to mothers who received the drug. Dr. Way said the medical profession was concernes about “getting burned again” if some technique that is now considered safe — for ezample ultrasound, a standard part of amniocentests — ?? found in the future to produce unexpected complications. He wondered whethe obstetricians would under the new ruling be held liable in such hypothetical cases. The court's ruling has been well received by some experts. One prof. William J Curran of the Harvarrd School of Public Health predicted that the ruling would have “a possitive effect” on ob????trical care and that it would lead to “a better chance of avoiding tragic births.... It's a situation where the court thought it out fairy well. It reflects good, solid, medical and genetic‐counselling reasoning. But the dilemma preceived by doc tors was recognised in a dissenting opinion by Judge Sol Wachtler. He pre dicted that the ruling would involve “human costs” because it would lead doctors to lead doctors to pratice “defensive medi cian”. He suggested that physicians would advise abortion “rather than run the risk of having to pay for the lifetime care of the child if it is born with a handicap. “The result he said, would be the absortion of otherwise healthy children” as the only alternative to the threat of pe???ary liability”.

It's Small‐Pond Time Again,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/31/archives/its-smallpond-time-again.html,"OXFORD, England — As a professor in an American university in 1968, I was asked one day by a student of philosophy to sign yet another letter of protest about conscription and the war in Vietnam. I said that I would probably sign but that I needed to read the letter first, to which he immediately replied that if I wanted to read the letter before signing, “That already shows that you are not one of us.” “Us” meant radicals, as opposed to wishy‐washy liberals, who niggle about words in a legalistic way. The remark was only half a joke, and it had an entirely serious background and meaning for both of us. By the 50's and 60's, orthodox political theorists and philosophy professors had long been teaching that there was a clear division between moral questions, which demand an outpouring of warm, human emotions and nothing else, and questions of social science and historical fact, which call for a cool head and a hard look at evidence. This conventional wisdom can be traced back to philosophies that had been very influential in American universities since the war, having originated in Vienna and in Cambridge, England. If morality, political or private, was properly a matter of bursts of feeling, if emotive utterance, of rhetoric, it was just an illusion to introduce logic and strict argument into discussions of right and wrong. At aoout the same time there were plenty of confident professors and other experts in that heyday of the so. cial sciences who were eager to describe, analyze and diagnose the important trends in society in a detached, clinical spirit, as if they were examining a physical organism, with no question of value, of right and wrong, allowed to enter their Olympian minds. Students therefore flocked at that time to sociology lectures, and paperbacks on Society with a capital S poured from the press. The intellectual scene has changed drastically in the last six or seven years, both inside and outside universities; in my opinion, entirely for the better. Academic philosophers have come down into the arena of public discussion and now argue freely in their journals and meetings about such topics as euthanasia, abortion, affirmative action and positive discrimination, the moral status of animals, medical ethics, the laws of war. There is even a journal entirely designed for such discussions, “Philosophy and Public Affairs.” From such quiet centers there is again a ripple effect into journalism and active politics, ideas passing from philosophy into public opinion, as they often do. The change has in effect been a rethinking of what can properly count as reason and of the part to be given to emotion in relation to it. It had been quite usual, particularly the United States, to identify reason with scientific method alone, and to insist that all political and social studies must finally become scientific if they are to be taken seriously; there is the old cliche that we need a science of man if the technologies based on the physical sciences are not to destroy us; a false hope, I think. If one asks how much a thoughtful citizen in the last decade can have learned about the issues of the day from all the books on sociology, the answer is, “Almost nothing that can be called scientific; a few shrewd observations perhaps.” But there is another institution that can be seen as an embodiment of reason no less than the natural sciences: law. The study of law, and more particularly of the philosophy of law, has swept into the empty space irii by growing disappointment with social science. The habit of precise and inconclusive argument about the Bakke case, or about why abortion is or is not unlike murder, or about the difference between killing and not prolonging life, is an exercise of reason and in the weighing of facts, where otherwise mere blind emotion would certainly take command. Highly emotional issues of life and death and sexuality need not be decided without the guidance of careful argument, even if the final outcome is not usually a conclusive proof but only a reasonable, well‐founded opinion. So the very same 1968 student would probably now allow me to read his letter of protest in a legalistic way before signing; he would probably now agree that intensity is not the only measure of feeling, and that precise emotions go together with precise words and that inchoate and vague emotions, if they are also intense, can destroy the world quite soon. The change is an encouraging one; but I cannot say how far this ripple of ideas from a small pond will extend into the great political seas where the effective decisions arc made; only that there is a chance.

$121 BILLION BUDGET WITH NEW TAX CUTS IS OFFERED BY CAREY,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/31/archives/127-billion-budget-with-new-tax-cuts-is-offered-by-carey-limited.html,"ALBANY, Jan. 30 — Governor Carey proposed a $12.7 billion budget today for the 1979‐80 fiscal year that included modest tax cuts over three years, limited increases in local aid and an admonition to local governments to contain Spending. State aides said the proposal contained the $369 million New York r needed to close its budget gap in 1980. But city of fi- cials said they had not yet been told where the money appeared in the budget, and the administrations of Mr. Carey and Mayor Koch remained at odds over the Mayor's insistence that $200 million had to be “new” money for the city. Presenting a program that would lower taxes $372 million by 1982 and $44 million this year, Mr. Carey said: “Government cannot spend beyond necessity, for to do so requires taxes beyond reason.” At the same time, the Governor urged attention to “the compelling needs of those who, because of illness, disability or poverty, are unable to benefit from the opportunities of economic growth.” He proposed spending increases in programs for children and adolescents, the elderly, mental hygiene, health care, education and corrections. In all, the proposal called for an increase over last year's budget of $785 million, or 6.6 percent. The keynote of the message, however, was the need to limit government spending and foster private industry. To this end, Mr. Carey proposed a Local Government Expenditure Review Board that would use guidelines and public pronouncements to persuade local governments to cut their budgets. Included in the Governor's 1,095‐page budget were the following proposals: cA series of tax reductions, including cut in the maximum personal income‐tax rate from 12percent to 10 percent by 1981, originally proposed by Republicans; cut in the capital‐gains tax; reductions designed to assist the low‐income elderly, and a series of modest cuts in business taxes to help small and middle‐sized companies and three specific industries. Mr. Carey would also postpone a $50 increase in the personal exemption but would pro- vide other benefits for middle‐income taxpayers. A net increase of $459 million in local assistance, despite cutbacks in revenuesharing aid. The budget would also provide $77 million to raise the state's share of local court costs from 50 to 75 percent, and to cover cost increases. The state is scheduled to take over court costs fully by next year. Mr. Carey's proposal would result in a decrease in state revenue-sharing money for localities by $9.5 million from last year—and by $90 million from what the old formula would have produced this year. An increase of $203 million in operating aid for the state's public schools. In an effort to reduce the gap between rich and poor districts, Mr. Carey would cut financing for the wealthiest quarter of the state's 705 school districts. New York City would gain about $71 million from the plan, $10 to $15 million more than state budget officials had originally estimated. Fifty‐five million dollars to build two 512‐bed maximum‐security correctional facilities on the sites of existing prison's at Wallkill and Woodbourne and to renovate the prison at Ossining to provide another 940 cells. The state expects its prison population, now more than 21,000, to increase by 1,000 this year. The budget also allocates $7.4 million to the Division for Youth for 150 additional “secure beds” for youths convicted of felonies. A $50 million program — up $10 million from last year — for special youth programs. Taking a cue from the United Nations’ declaration of 1979 as the International Year of the Child, Mr. Carey proposed an expansion of programs to fight juvenile delinquency, combat drug abuse among young people and broaden afterschool recreational opportunities for children. The budget also provides for additional efforts to prevent unnecessary placement of children in out-of-state foster care programs. Eighty‐four million dollars in new spending in a $474 million capital-construction budget. Beside providing money needed to begin work on a Convention Center in New York City, the budget allows for limited increases in transportation programs, sewage treatment and other conservation projects. The budget also includes spending for the Urban Development Corporation's economic development. Ten million dollarS to subsidize the cost of drugs for the low‐income elderly. The budget also includes small increases for health care in poor areas and for programs to detect breast cancer. A $77 million increase in spending by the Department of Mental Hygiene, largely for programs to assist mental patients released into communities, an expenditure designed to diffuse criticism of “dumping” of mental patients. But the budget contains deep cutbacks in drugabuse programs The Governor announced the closing of two treatment centers, in New York City and Buffalo. A $32 million increase for the State University of New York, less than half of what Chancellor Clifton R. Wharton Jr. had requested. The issue of whether the Unversity will raise its tuition by $100 remains unsettled, but the shortfall could add to pressure on the Board of Trustees to implement the increase. The budget also includes an $11 million increase in operating aid for the City University of New York. The changes proposed by the Governor in the two programs through which the state funnels most of its aid to local governments — revenue sharing and education aid — have aroused Republican resistance and are expected to encounter opposition from local officials. Overall, the financial plan presented in the budget represented a continuation of delicately balanced fiscal policies that last year permitted the Governor to propose a $755 million tax cut. Mr. Carey's plan relies on a variety of devices to shift this year's unexpectedly large cash surplus more than $600 million - into the next fiscal year, and it will require more “slipping and sliding” next year, a state official said. At the same time, the budget contains series of tax reductions that will not have an immediate effect on the state's revenues. Of the $44 million in tax cuts in the 1979‐80 fiscal year, budget analysts said, less thap $20 million will be lost to the state this year, because of the way taxes are paid and collected and because of the maneuvering room the state has in paying refunds later or earlier. The difficulties of Mr. Carey's position were underlined by the abandonment of one of his campaign promises- to cut the state's corporate tax rate from 10 percent to 9 percent ‐as too costly. The Legislature could further erode Mr. Carey's position, aides said. The Republican‐led Senate is expected to push for faster enactment of the tax cuts and to urge changes in the Governor's education‐aid formula. Although the actual district-by-district effect of the intricate education formula will not be known until tomorrow, when the state releases a computer analysis, is already clear that the plan will hurt wealthy and politically‐influential suburban school districts. The new revenue‐sharing formula has already come under attack. The Senate majority leader, Warren M. Anderson, Binghamton Republican, said the plan “would create insurmountable problems for scores and scores of municipalities.” Mr. Anderson also criticized the school aid formula and characterized Mr. Carey's transfer of the $600 million surplus to his new budget as a “Houdinilike” act. The minority leader of the Assembly, James L. Emery, Republican of Geneseo, said Mr. Carey's revenue‐sharing plan would force localities to “boost levies on real property.” The Speaker of the Democratic-controlled Assembly, Stanley Fink of Brooklyn, was also subdued in his praise. “Structurally, it's not frenetic,” Mr. Fink said. “It's prudent, and it does have a goal.” Mr. Fink added that he wanted to make sure the budget did “no great violence” to local governments. The entire budget could also be held up this year, as it was last year, by the emotional battle over whether the state should use Medicaid funds to pay for abortions for poor women. But today, Mr. Carey contented himself with the fact that only once before in the last quarter century has an election been followed by a tax reduction in New York State. “Difficult decisions lie ahead,” Mr. Carey said. “But we have made hard choices and we can make them again.”"
Lee Marvin Is Drawing Crowds At Trial Over Suit for $1 Million,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/31/archives/lee-marvin-is-drawing-crowds-at-trial-over-suit-for-1-million-actor.html,"LOS ANGELES, Jan. 30 — Long lines of people have become a familiar sight outside the Los Angeles Superior Court building where Lee Marvin, the actor, is defending himself against a suit in which the woman he lived with for more than six years is seeking more than $1 million. Special to The New York Times Michelle Triola, who legally changed her name to Michelle Marvin shortly before she and the actor separated in 1970. contends that the couple had an oral agreement that he would support her for life if she gave up her singing career to serve as his cook, companion and confidante. Not since 1970, when California's pioneering no‐fault divorce act made it unnecessary to disclose the indiscretions of one's mate, has the zrivate life of a Hollywood personality been discussed in such intimate detail in an open courtroom. The trial, which resumed today after being in recess yesterday, is being watched closely by hundreds of people who have filed similar suits in New York and 15 other states seeking property rights that are commonly awarded after married couples are divorced. Mr. Marvin has said that Miss Triola was “enjoyable and fun to be with” but that he had never agreed to share his property with her. Miss Triola contends that she was Mr. Marvin's wite in every way except for having a marriage license. She told Judge Arthur K. Marshall that she had become pregnant three times by the actor but had never had a child because Mr. Marvin did not want to become a father. The 54-year-old actor, who won an Academy Award in 1965 for portraying gunfighter in “Cat Ballou,” testified last week that he might have told the 46-yearold singer that he loved her on a number of occasions but that he had never made an implied contract to share assets. He said statements in love letters he wrote to her while making films in Europe 13 years ago were “sexual promises rather than promises to spend my life with her.” The actor has corroborated much of the testimony that Miss Triola had given last week. He testified on Friday that he had given her $600 in cash for an abortion, that they had registered as husband and wife at various hotels, and that he had introduced her as Mrs. Marvin to “avoid embarrassment for her, not me.” Mr. Marvin said he had discouraged her from legally changing her name and had even joked that she should change to Gary Cooper because “if you are going to change it, it should be a big name.” Mr. Marvin said the couple had maintained joint checking accounts when he was making films in Oregon and Arizona because it was convenient to do so. He also said he had given Miss Triola the responsibility of paying all the bills for household expenses out of his $1,500 weekly allowance while making “Paint Your Wagon.” The couple met on the set of “Ship of Fools,” a film in which Mr. Marvin had major role and Miss Triola was a dancer. He had separated from his first wife, Betty, after a long marriage. He and Miss Triola began living together in her Hollywood Hills apartment several weeks after they met and moved into a Malibu beach house several months later. Two and a half years later, he received a divorce that caused his net worth to drop to $19,000 because he had to pay his former wife $5,000 a month in alimony, $1,000 a month in child support for the couple's four children and half of the residual payments for the television series “M Squad.” Marvin Mitchelson, Miss Triola's lawyer, maintains that his client is entitled to half of the approximately $3.6 million the actor earned during their six‐year relationship."
Women and Smoking — Newest Research Shows the Health Tons Mounting,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/02/archives/women-and-smoking-newest-research-shows-the-health-toll-is-mounting.html,"“I never realized that by smoking I was killing myself — not until I got lung cancer,” said Jeanne Owens, a New York City artist who lost part of a lung two years ago and the rest of it last Jung when the cancer recurred. “No doctor or dentist ever told me to stop, or I might have.” said Miss Owens, once a three‐pack‐a‐day smoker. “I had no idea ho* poor the odds are of surviving lung cancer. The whole matter has been soft‐pedaled. The warning on the packs should say, ‘Smoking will probably kill you.’ “ Miss Owens, now 59 years old, took up the cigarette habit at age 18, encouraged by a boyfriend who told her she'd look cute. “He never smoked himself,” she remarked. “Today he's as healthy as a horse. I could kill him for getting me into this.” Miss Owens is among 22,000 American women who were found to have lung cancer in 1977. Last year, 23,000 women were added to the fast‐growing ranks of female victims of lung cancer. Nearly all were smokers, and nearly all will die of their cancers. This year, an additional 30,000 women will be diagnosed as having lung cancer, and a projected 25,200 will die of the disen 30‐Year, Fourfold Rise in Deaths Women who smoke more than a pack a day or who have been smoking at any level for more than 30 years are 10 times more likely to die of lung cancer than nonsmokers. In the last three decades, death from lung cancer among women have increased fourfold. Since 1969, lung cancer has moved from the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths in women to the third. The lung cancer rate among women is now increasing so rapidly that by the next decade it is expected to surpass breast cancer, a more common but also more curable disease, as the leading. cause of cancer deaths in women. This statistic is just one of many alarming trends in smoking among women discussed in the Government's latest report on smoking and health. For years, perhaps because many fewer women smoked and because the early studies of the hazards of smoking dealt only with men, many women smokers thought they were somehow protected from the havoc that cigarette smoking can wreak in the human body. However, the document, issued last month by the Department of Health. Education and Welfare, has focused new attention on the rapidly growing body of evidence citing the hazards of smoking to women and their unborn children. According to the newest find ings, as the smoking habits of women become more like those of men, so do the consequences to health. Heart Attacks and Cleers Thus, in addition to lung caner, women smokers, of whom there are more today than ever before, are more likely than nonsmokers to suffer heart attacks and hemorrhages under the skull and to develop ulcers, cancers of the larynx and bladder, chronic lung diseases and a host of respiratory symptoms and other ills. A woman smoker's risk of heart attack and hemorrhage is dramatically increased if she also uses oral contraceptives. Among men and women whose smoking habits are similar, researchers have found, the health effects of smoking are similarly damaging. When the age at which they started smoking, the amount they smoke, the degree of inha lation and strength of the cigarette are taken into account, women are just as likely as men ,to die from the effects of cigarettes. Women who smoke more than two packs a day and inhale are twice as likely to die as women their age who do not smoke. In addition, smoking by pregnant women has dramatic, harmful effects on the unborn. Smoking mothers have a higher rate of spontaneous abortion. The babies of women who smoke during pregnancy are likely 10 be smaller at birth, and they appear never to catch up: The more a woman smokes while she is pregnant, the smaller her baby is likely to be. These babies also face a greater risk of dying at birth or shortly afterward, and of suffering crib death. Among those pregnant women who smoke less than a pack a day, the risk of perinatal death is increased by 20 percent and among those smoking more than a pack a day, the risk is increased 35 percent. There are more complications of labor and delivery among smoking women. These women are more likely to deliver prematurely, a major cause of neonatal death. Children of smoking mothers are more likely to have neurological abnormalities and they score lower on psychological tests. They are also more likely to be hyperactive, a condit for associated with behavior and learning problems. The effects of maternal smoking persist through early childhood; lags in growth and intellectual development can still be ceen at age 11, one major study showed. Children chose mothers smoked half a pack or more a day during pregnancy were shorter and were three to five months behind in reading, mathematics and general ability. The damage caused by smoking to the unborn child apparently results mainly from a shortage of oxygen during fetal development. The carbon monoxide in cigarette smoke replaces oxygen in the blood and reduces the pressure of oxygen delivered to the fetal tissues. Research has indicated that by smoking two packs a day, a pregnant woman reduces her baby's oxygen supply by about 40 percent. If a woman gives up smoking during pregnancy, her risk of delivering a small baby is no greater than that of a woman who never smoked However, a new study, recently released, reported that even if a woman quits smoking before pregnancy, her chances of having placental abnormalities and birth complications remains higher than for nonsmokers. When the first Surgeon General's report on smoking and health was issued in 1964, the data on the effects of smoking on women and their offspring were scant, and few firm conclusions could be reached. Only one page of that report was specifically concerned with women (the current report has 75 pages). The lack of information reflected in part the tact that women took up smoking decades later and in much smaller numbers than men. The average woman who smoked started later in life, consumed fewer cigarettes per day, was less likely to inhale and more likely to use a filter or a milder brand of cigarette than the average male smoker. In recent decades, however, there have been great changes in women's smoking habits. As Dr. Daniel Horn, an expert of the Federal Public Health Service, put it, “You've come a long way, baby — toward a shorter life.” The tobacco industry, recognizing a potentially large market among women, has in recent years introduced numerous brands especially for women, advertising them heavily in women's magazines. The ads appeal to women's presumed desires to be slim, sophisticated, liberated and “with it.” While there are still fewer women who smoke than men, since 1965 there has been an 8.5 percent decline in the total number of adult men who smoke, but an 11.1 percent increase in the number of women smokers. Today there are far more heavy smokers among women, and more women smokers inhale. One frequently suggested reason for the increase in the number of women who smoke is that cigarettes may be a symbol of equality with men. The smoking habits of men and women in similar jobs are similar, and among people in managerial or administrative positions, a greater percentage of women than men are smokers. While the decline in the percent of men who smoke has been greatest among men in the health professions, smoking among nurses, most of whom are women, has increased. The lowest rate of smoking is found among housewives, even though married women are somewhat more likely to smoke than single women. The most marked decline in women smokers has occurred among college graduates; those with grade school or lower educations are as likely to be smoking today as they were in the 1960's. For reasons not well understood, women generally have a more difficult time than men in giving up smoking permanently. There is some evidence that women smokers tend to suffer more severe abstinence symptoms than men do. There .may be a cultural influence, too. After they stop smoking, women appear to be more concerned than men are about gaining weight, which results from substituting food for cigarettes. Last year, 23,000 women were diagnosed as having lung cancer. This year, 30,000 cases are expected to be found."
REGIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/04/archives/regions-india-signs-of-economic-health-amid-nagging-ills.html,"NEW DELHI INDIA, once a symbol of poverty, is forging a place for itself among the industrialized nations of the 20th century. Industrial and agricultural production are up comfortably from a year ago, and the country is growing enough grain to feed its people‐but not to feed them particularly well. Foreign‐exchange reserves are higher than ever, prices are relatively steady and the economy - with what is now the world's 10th‐largest gross national product - is nearing almost total self‐sufficiency. Indeed, in the 30 years since independence from Britain, India has become a major exporter, and the future seems less bleak than it once did. “For the first two or three decades of independence we borrowed technology from the developed nations,” said R.K. Singh, director of the Engineering Export Promotion Council here. “Now we are turning around and sending it back out to the world.” Malaysia and Nigeria have begun importing Indian ball bearings; the Middle Eastern countries import Indian tractors and diesel engines; American manufacturers buy varieties of nuts and bolts and drills no longer made in the United States. Last year, for the first time, Iridia's exports of steel and engineering goods exceeded the value of such traditional export leaders as sugar and textiles. Five years ago they accounted for only 7 percent of exports; now they are nearly 20 percent of the $5.5 billion in exports, and officials expect the pace of expansion to continue. The progress in agriculture resulted mostly from bountiful summer rains last year - for the fourth year in a row - and there was a record harvest of more than 125 million tons of foodgrains, enough to eliminate the need for imports. Four straight good monsoon seasons is an unusually long string, and economists say it is reasonable to expect a bad season this year or next. But because of increased irrigation over the last decade, many Indian farmers are less dependent on the rains. But still only one‐fourth of the land is irrigated, and a bad monsoon could have disastrous consequences. The political consequences could provide grave new problems for Prime Minister Morarji R. Desai, who has had some troubles holding his Government together during its first two years in office. One of the major agricultural achievements recently has been the accumulation of 16 million tons of foodgrains in storage as a buffer against mass starvation if a bad year comes. “India's food situation is comfortable,” as one politician put it, but that does not mean that all - or even most - Indians are eating adequately. Despite the impressive economic gains symbolized by the Calcutta factories and the skyscrapers of Bombay, India has more people than the entire population of the United States living in what a recent report by the World Bank called “absolute poverty,” and the burgeoning population poses massive problems for economic planners. Rural Indians live scarcely different than their ancestors, using the same primitive tools to hack the same poor living out of small plots of land. Malnutrition is a chronic problem, stunting millions of lives by retarding physical and mental development and indirectly causing millions of deaths. Government efforts to improve conditions have been widespread but hampered by slow acceptance by the vast and diverse population shackled by ancient customs, illiteracy and a rigid social system. Yet changes are beginning to appear: 9Hindus and Moslems, despite sporadic clashes, are living in greater harmony, and India has shown itself to be a genuinely secular state. ¶The debilitating caste system, which has prevented Indians of the lower classes from making social and economic gains, is undergoing change as members of the bottom level, the so‐called “untouchables,” begin to press for their rights under newly strengthened laws banning discrimination. ¶Education is penetrating more deeply, and the illiteracy rate has not grown so fast as the population. ¶Women are enjoying greater freedom as the Government moves against child marriages and the dowry system, which encourage large families, and divorce and abortion have been made much easier. Many Indians believe that a crucial step toward better conditions must be an invigorated program of birth control. With nearly 650 million people living in a land one‐third the size of the United States, India has one of the world's most pressing population problems. And for political reasons, the Desai Government is doing much less about it than Indira Gandhi's Government did. Toward the end of Mrs. Gandhi's term in office, there were many instances of forced sterilization, and the resentment caused is thought to have been a major factor in her defeat at the polls in March of 1977. As a result, the Desai Government backed far away from the program, and the rate of sterilizations fell to its lowest level in 10 years. Now, 35,000 more Indians are born each day, and their need for food, clothing and housing puts an onerous burden on the economy. Family‐planning officials, and others, are gravely concerned. In an appeal last fall for a renewed commitment to birth control, two dozen members of Parliament issued this warning to the Government: “If the size of the family is not restrained, we will hardly be able to find resources for their proper education, for giving them food, clothing and other basic necessities. Galloping growth of population can jeopardize the very basis of all our endeavors.” ❑ India has moved explosively into the industrialized world. The Bhabba Atomic Research Center at Trombay."
Defining Women's Issues’ Splits the Administration and Its Former Feminist Supporters,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/04/archives/salvaging-the-era-remains-a-carter-goal.html,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 — President Carter met today with Marjorie Bell Chambers, acting chairman of the National Advisory Committee for Women, and told her that he expected her panel to be “independent” but to stick to women issues. UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL DISPATCH Jimmy Carter said it often during the 1976 presidential campaign: He would work to eliminate “the last vestiges legal discrimination” against women, just as Lyndon B. Johnson had seen to the eradication of laws that permitted discrimination against blacks. The women had helped Mr. Carter. Bella Abzug, the great conciliator at the Democratic National Colivcdtion, was denounced by some feminists for selling out when she told the skeptical women delegates that “He made a commitment, and he said he believes our country is ready to change.” She was out on the hustings, and so were the Gloria Steinems and the Midge Costanzas. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of women volunteers tended to the everyday chores that make a campaign work. Now, at the midpoint of his term in office, White House aides acknowledge that Jimmy Carter's relationship with women activists is a mess. It is even worse than his relationship with organized labor, blacks, and liberals. “We have a year to show that we can produce something, like the Equal Rights Amendment.” said Sarah Weddington, the President's new special assistant for women's issues. The Administration, relying on executive privilege, Parcelled Mrs. Wed lington's scheduled appearapce before a Senate committee last week, a move that caused further alienation. Although the White House insisted that the restraints on Mrs. Weddington were no different than those placed on other White House aides, several women activists saw the action as the latest in a long line of petty humiliations. The White House had cancelled a television appearance by Midge Costanza, who was Mrs. Weddington's predecessor, for example; and more recently, Mrs. Abzug had been dismissed as an unpaid adviser because she publicly criticized the President (although some Cabinet members who had publicly taken issue with his policies had suffered no such consequences). The dispute is partly obscured by personality clashes the abrasiveness of Mrs. Abzug, on the one hand, and the scarcely concealed chauvinism of some White House staff members on the other, pefhaps made trouble inevitable. But beyond that the differences involve a basic question: What are women's issues? To the White House, women's issues are the traditional ones, and mostly matters of law — the Equal Rights Amendment; legislation on abortion, day care, pregnancy, disability, displaced homemakers; the appointment of women to government jobs. The “pure feminists” generally agree with the White House interpretation. But the “social feminists” take a larger view, and that is why they are more active in party politics. To them, women's issues include the fight against inflation and the increase in military spending. Their concerns include the Administration's decision to cut funds for the cities, “where a majority of women and all Americans live,” according to a report by the National Advisory Committee for Women that criticized White House policies and led to Mrs. Abzug's dismissal. To the President, the report seemed a betrayal. “Our idea is that if you want to get E.R.A. passed, you don't do it by kicking your friends in the face,” said Jody Powell, the President's press secretary. Mr. Carter had indeed worked hard for the Equal Rights Amendment, as well as for a limitation on veteran's preference in jobs, legislation for displaced homemakers, pregnancy disability and flexible work hours. His Administration had issued regulations that banned involuntary sterilization, and had worked for equality in the Social Security system. The President had appointed women to about 20 percent of the senior positions in his Administration, and although his record on judicial appointments was not yet inspiring, he was pressing for the appointment of women to new Federal judgeships. So what did women want? The Administration's budget was an affront, activists said, with its cutbacks on social welfare programs. Women make up 63 percent of the 16 million Americans living below poverty level, the Abzug report said; women are 42 percent of the labor force, but they are 50 percent of the total unemployed. A Congressional staff woman who has participated in several political campaigns said that many male politicians had trouble understanding this reasoning. When women tried to get a commitment on welfare reform from George McGovern in the 1972 campaing, she said, Mr. McGovern asked if welfare reform was a “woman's issue.” In a sense, the women are following in the footsteps of black activists, who not only sought to end discrimination, but have also raised wider issues and vigorously attacked the President's budget. Some women have concluded. how. ever, that they lack the clout of black activists because they haven't been perceived as a power base with a coherent point of view. Some believe that an appointment of a woman to the Supreme Court, or passage of the Equal Rights Amendment, would go a long way toward repairing the damage. Harsher critics do not think so. They contend that Mr. Carter has rarely given women anything more than lip service, and they object to what they regard as a paternalistic attitude. “It's this whole, ‘Don't worry your pretty little head about it, because we'll take care of you’ attitude.” said Carol Burris, president of the Women's Lobby. What if the bridges cannot be rebuilt? A veteran woman activist noted that women will make up 50 percent of the delegates at the Democratic Party's 1930 nominating convention, and that women, as usual, will be handling much of the grass‐roots campaign work. “Are they going to go out and make sure that Jimmy Carter is not humiliated?” she asked.

Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/04/archives/letters-president-carters-philippine-giveaway.html,"To the Editor: It is discouraging to observe in the recent signing of a new PhilippineAmerican Bases Agreement how little is understood about the political realities in that far‐flung island chain by leaders in Washington, who can draw on three generations of experience in dealing with Philippine affairs. Out of that lack of understanding President Carter has embarked on a course which can only be subversive of the best interests of both the American and the Philippine people.nant woman and the father work off the medical bill for the abortion. Far Rockaway, N.Y., Jan. 23, 1979 Hoboken. N.J., Jan. 30, 1979 The American taxpayer is being asked to hand over an additional half billion dollars in grants and loans to a corrupt, authoritarian regime at a time of severe budgetary restraint, which requires cutbacks in all sorts of important programs within the U.S. And to anyone who haS followed the situation closely, it is clear that those funds constitute one of the most unnecessary give‐aways in the history of U.S. foreign policy. Whatever it may be called officially, this sum is rent. The argument will be used that the payment of this huge amount was necessary to permit the use of the bases over the next five years —but the argument is false. The existing bases agreement runs until 1991, without any required amendment. And Mr. Marcos needs those bases badly — both for their $200 million‐plus annual injection into the Philippine economy, now faltering, and as a symbol of American support. which a Philippine ruler must have to maintain his legitimacy in the eyes of a public still very respectful of things American. Thus, to imagine that Marcos would have actually tried — contrary to the clear preference of his own military to expel American forces or seriously restrict their access to the bases because rentals were not forthcoming is absurd, even though he did indirectly threaten to do some such thing during the long discussions leading to signing. American negotiators were bamboozled by a very smart operator. Nor will the $500 million benefit Filipinos. At least $300 million will go directly for military purposes, i.e., to purchase arms to be used against Filipinos — Christian or Moslem — to strengthen those armed forces which have been accused before the world by recognized authorities of persistent violations of human rights, including the torture death of scores‐of regime opponents. And even the majority of Filipinos who will never be in armed conflict with their Government will suffer, for the more Mr. Marcos is dependent on the military for his political longevity (and this agreement will only deepen that dependence) the less sensitive will he become to the legitimate demands of major groups in Philippine society for freedom and justice. We are now witnessing the consequences of such authoritarian insensitivity, exacerbated by massive American military aid, in Iran. Certainly there are lessons to be learned. In the Philippine case, only Congress can now correct the error made — by refusing to appropriate funds for purpose so clearly contrary to the public good. Windsor, Ontario, Jan. 22, 1979 The writer, a professor in the University of Windsor's Political Science Department, is president of the Canadian Society for Asian Studies. To the Editor: Pro‐abortionists and anti‐abortionists agree on one issue. They completely disregard an age‐old morality: The father is responsible for the mother and the child. Neither group ever even mentions the father. The anti‐abortionists want to save the fetus but seemingly would let the child starve to death. Peculiarly, in Washington only the pro‐abortionists demanded that the Government assume its responsibility of guaranteeing the child's life through social and welfare programs to feed, house and educate the child. What are the, results of eliminating the father's responsibility? Take the case of a good‐looking, fast‐talking, physically forceful male. Within a few years, in one neighborhood, with no abortions, he could father 50 children, doomed to grow up illegitimate and hungry. And in 18 or so years, they could marry each other, with dire genetic consequences for their children. Or, if abortions are allowed, 50 fetuses are aborted, and you and I pay for the pleasure of one male and 50 females. That is ridiculous. Let the pregWhether the pro‐abortionists or the anti‐abortionists rule, the lives of the 50 girls are marred by either abortion or illegitimate children. Society, women and the children can only benefit by returning to the age‐old morality that demands that the father take responsibility for the mother and the child.

The attitude this proposal bespeaks is the basic reason why middle‐class voters and taxpayers like myself are turning to such candidates as Jeffrey Bell and to such causes as Proposition 13. On the one hand, my contribution to the Government increases steadily while those above me and below me seem to be paying less and less: The poor benefit from special tax breaks; the rich have low capital‐gains rates and tax‐free municipal bonds. On the other hand, benefits deriving from the Government are increasingly being diverted to those above me and below me. I am too rich to qualify for a Government‐subsidized mortgage or student loan and too poor to benefit from investment tax credits and the like. Now Mr. Rosen is proposing that the Government deprive my class of yet another benefit. This would only compound the unevenhanded distribution of governmental benefits, making the unevenhanded collection of governmental revenues even more galling. If the Government counts on supporting itself from my pocket, it should toss me a bone occasionally. Otherwise I and others harboring the same resentment can be counted on to become increasingly less willing to chip in. To the Editor: The literature on transportation is loaded with comparisons on the amount of energy consumed by the several modes: rail, bus and automobiles. As in the case of the technical report used to support your opposition to heavy Federal subsidies for Amtrak (editorial Jan. 9), no distinction is made as to the type of fuel saved (oil, coal, etc.), nor was recognition given to the fact that those living near rail stations use relatively small amounts of gasoline in comparison with communities designed around the automobile. The preservation of Amtrak is only holding action until we can see the full implications of rapidly consuming the world's oil supplies. In most other countries, programs are already under way to make more efficient use of remaining rail lines as the backbone of a petroleum‐efficient transportation system. High‐density housing within walking distance of rail stations and effective use of buses to feed into the stations provide an efficient, petroleum‐saving pattern of urban living. I agree it will be costly to support Amtrak. But, these costs must continue until we are willing to take major steps in petroleum conservation through improved patterns of urban living, plus the coordination of our surface transportation systems. As your editorial said, “Amtrak needs an average of 12 cents a [passenger] mile in subsidies to maintain service.” The seven million residents of New Jersey spend approximately 25 cents a mile to drive their cars, which, in a year's time, amounts to a tidy sum of over $12 billion for what admittedly is a great deal of mobility. While we enjoy this great personal mobility, will our children's and grandchildren's generations also be able to sample this pleasure if we abandon our rail passenger systems today? Commissioner of Transportation State of New Jersey Trenton, Jan. 13, 1979 To the Editor: In a Jan. 24 letter William Pain asserts that American English has become the lingua franca of the world. Recently the head of a small U.S. manufacturing company asked me to recommend a tutor in German for him and his wife. It seems that his company has entered into close business relations with a West German firm. While several executives of that firm speak English, many of the middlemanagement and technical personnel with whom he has frequent contact do not. He also felt he should know the language in order to meet with his German counterparts socially. I suggest that one factor contributing to our weak performance as an exporting country and the resulting unfavorable balance of trade is the prevalence of the mistaken notion propounded by Mr. Pain.

To the Editor: Now that Iran is in anarchy and Turkey in turmoil, the time may seem to be auspicious for the Soviets to realize a secular ambition: bursting out of their continental icebox to the warmwater ports in the Persian Gulf and the Turkish Straits. Russia's warm‐water thirst, under czars and commissars, has been axiomatic. With that in view, recollections of recent precedents may be of some use. During the Second World War, an agreement between the United States, the Soviet Union and Britain reserved special status for Moscow in Iran's northwestern province, Azerbaijan, end of the pipeline for America's LendLease assistance to the Soviets. The Russians were to evacuate this province, at the latest six months after the war. They did not. Instead, they set up a puppet government under a local Communist, Jafar Pishevari, who promptly started dividing the land, preparatory to collectivizing it, and other reforms. Iran took the case to the U.N. Security Council, then more active body than now. The Council ordered the two sides to settle the case. Within two months, Soviet troops were out and the puppet government was across the border. At about the same time, riding high on the euphoria of a: stunning victory, the Soviets tried to pry the Turkish Straits open. Their plan was to place that vital link between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean under the “joint defense” of themselves and the Turks. Knowing what that meant, the United States and the United Kingdom supported the rejection of the plan by the Turks. Though huffing and puffing, the Soviets dropped the plan. A few years later — in the early fifties — an Iranian left‐wing government, headed by Mohammed Mossadegh and backed by the crypto‐Communist Tudeh Party and related groups, nationalized the country's oil industry and forced the Shah into exile. A few days later, the ruler returned on the C.I.A. bandwagon, while Mossadegh became an ex‐premier in jail. But Iran's oil has remained nationalized. Besides ominous noises, the Russians again did nothing. In later years, seemingly forgetful of these humiliations, the Soviets have engaged in joint undertakings with Iran and Turkey, industrial and otherwise. They contracted large quantities of natural gas from Iranian fields to the industrialized regions of Soviet Central Asia, particularly Uzbekistan. Those deliveries are now suspended. These precedents may be indicat ions of the considerable span between Soviet rhetoric and deeds. New York, Jan. 26, 1979 The writer is professor of history, emeritus, at Fairleigh Dickinson University. To the Editor: I suggest a return to the use of “mann,” Anglo‐Saxon for “human being,” thus avoiding both the sexist assumptions of the generic “man” and the alternative chaos of awkward phrases and unwieldy construction. Such other applications as “congressmann,” “chairmann” and “mann‐made” would be an improvement in our self‐conscious lexicon. The beauty and clarity of plain old Anglo‐Saxon are as nourishing as bread. Our words, like us, are made of “muck” and “wundor.” Let's call mann a mann. Chicago, Jan. 26. 1979"
Andreotti and Communists: Pact May Not Be Dead,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/07/archives/andreotti-and-communists-pact-may-not-be-dead-news-analysis.html,"ROME, Feb. 6 — In itself, the fall of the Government of Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti does not bring the formal alliance between Italy's Communists and Christian Democrats to an end. It may prove to be only an interruption. News Analysis It will take weeks of negotiations and perhaps a new general election to determine whether the two parties can work out another compromise that would per- mit the communists to continue to give their support, in one form or another, to government dominated by the Christian Democrats. Only if there is no such compromise will the Communists end the alliance and revert to their previous role as an opposition party. The alliance has been good for the country, but at the same time it has become a threat, or potential threat, to the more narrow political interests of both leading parties. This is the quandary that the Communists and Christian Democrats both face. The Communists have paid for their moderation with setbacks in local elections and loss of grassroots support. They say they are tired of sharing responsibility without getting a greater share of power, and they demand to enter the government with their own people in the cabinet. Surviving the Slaying of Moro The Christian Democrats say the Communist demand is unacceptable, but they also fear that without Communist support the country will again become ungovernable. Italy, in fact, might well have been ungovernable last year had it not been for the alliance between the two parties. A remarkable degree of national unity permitted the country to emerge relatively unscathed from the trauma of the abduction and slaying of former Prime Minister Aldo Mom by the Red Brigades terrorist organization. If the Goverment majority had not reached all the way from the right wing of the Christian Democrats to the left wing of the Communist Party, the terrorists might well have been able to create the climate of civil war and class warfare that was their goal. During the two months they held Mr. Moro, the terrorists sought to provoke the police into taking repressive measures that would have been resented by most Italians. The Government avoided the trap, in part because with Communist backing it felt strong enough to do so. Since decisions were made jointly, the police were never seen as a party instrument during the crisis. Moreover, the presence of the Communists in the governing majority was instrumental in isolating the Red Brigades from the young unemployed, the students and the disenchanted of all kinds on whom they had counted for their “armed revolutionary party.” As it was, the more people the terrorists killed and maimed, the more isolated they became politically. Student violence, which had been frequent before, all but disappeared. Domestic Intelligence Rebuilt Communist support made it possible for the Government to start rebuilding the effective domestic intelligence service that had been dismantled years earlier when the Christian Democrats governed in alliance with the Socialists while the Communists were in the opposition. A carabinleri general known for his tough law-and-order stance, Carlo Alberto Della Chiesa, was put in charge of antiterrorist operations and given wide powers, which he used effectively. The general is not a popular man, and in the absence of a formal alliance his appointment probably would have given rise to disturbances. Both major parties acknowledge that the Government has not been able to root out terrorism. It had been hoped that the Communist Party's network of disciplined followers would make antiterrorist squads more efficient, but workers have refused to name co‐workers as terrorists. One of the few who did was Guido Rossa, a Communist labor official in Genoa, and he was shot dead by the Red Brigades last week. In a referendum last May, the Communist leadership took the politically dangerous step of instructing party members to vote against the repeal of law-andorder legislation that the party had denounced as repressive when it was, enacted at the request of the Christian Democrats three years earlier. Without Communist support, the law might well have been repealed. The switch was the most unpopular and politically costly decision made by the party during the alliance with the Government. Italy's first law permitting abortions, approved in May, also might not have passed except for the existence of the alliance. The Christian Democrats opposed it but finally bowed to pressure from the other parties, including the Communists. Prime Minister Andreotti, in citing the achievements of his Government to Parliament before resigning, dwealt heavily on finance — reduction of the rate of inflation from 23 to 12 percent, a positive balance of payments and “for the first time in Italian history” a positive trade balance. The Government might well have achieved these even without the alliance with the Communists. Problem With Economic Plan The alliance was not effective or only partly so in long‐range economic planning, social programs and bureaucratic changes, where it had been expected to count most. An outline for a three‐year plan to cure the country's economic ills had been worked out last spring, when the Communists entered the parliamentary majority in exchange for Mr. Andreotti's promise to consult them on all major decisions. The plan was meant to be the justification for the alliance and its most important single achievement. But negotiations on carrying out the plan were pushed aside, first by the Mom affair, then by an unscheduled presidential election in Parliament after President Giovanni Leone resigned amid unofficial charges of corruption. By the time the parties resumed the economic discussions after the summer recess, the consensus had evaporated. In the fall and early winter, unemployment remained high and wildcat strikes by workers in Rome and many other cities defied the official union leadership. When the Communists withdrew their support from the Government last week, they charged that it had failed to take their views into account sufficiently in the final drafting of the plan. Mr. Andreotti denied the charges. But it was too late. Both parties had lost, at least temporarily, the political will to continue the alliance.

WASHINGTON New Focus on Mexico,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/07/archives/washington-new-focus-on-mexico.html,"MEXICO CITY, Feb. 6 — These are busy days in Mexico City. Last month Pope John Paul II made his way here through the smog, to the applause of millions. Next week, President Carter will arrive for a state visit, and be will be followed by President Giscard d'Estaing of France. This tells us something about the growing influence of Mexico, particularly since it became an oil‐exporting country. But it also reminds us of the many unresolved problems that threaten to divide the United States and Mexico unless they adjust to the startling new facts on what the Pope called “the continent of hope.” Mr. Carter is not coming here to • deal with the price of Mexican gas though that is an immediate and divisive problem — but to deal with the price of neglect. After years of preoccupation with issues on other continents, Washington is finally paying more attention to the neighbors on its own continent — to the threat of separation by Quebec in Canada and the emergence of a wholly different Mexico across the Rio Grande. Mexico is now the most populous Spanish‐speaking country in the world, and the second most populous country in Latin America. Brazil is first. According to the local joke, “Brazil is a nation of the future — and always will be.” Mexico makes no claims to. be number one in Latin America, but it is moving up and demanding to be heard. It is now the United States's leading market in Latin America and our fourth best customer in the world. According to the latest estimates (made by Texas technicians to assure the support of world bankers), Mexico has proven oil resources of 40 billion barrels, and a potential production of 200 billion barrels (Saudi Arabia had proven capacity of 150 billion). But only 10 to 15 percent of Mexico's territory has been explored for oil so far. Mexico's main problem is that its production of oil is a theory while its production of children is a fact. Its population, less than 20 million in 1945, is now about 64 million. The rate of unemployment is almost 25 percent and of underemployment almost double that. And even on the Government's most optimistic estimates of its birth‐control campaign, the population of Mexico will be around 110 million at the turn of the century. These are the larger questions President Lopez Portillo wants to discuss with President Carter. He believes the problem of the illegal Mexican aliens in the United States is only one important part of many larger issues of trade, financing, exchange relations, monetary problems, and U.S. contraband trade into Mexico. “The first thing,” he told me “is to to state the problem within its proper framework and dimension. Then there's the possibility of solving it. Mexico does not wish to export workers, it wishes to export goods.” There is a lot of anti‐Yankee feeling in this country — much more than is realized in the United States. What we call the Mexican War is taught in the schools to this day here as “the unfair war” that deprived Mexico of half its territory. And the discovery of oil and gas seems to have increased Mexican resentment of U.S. domination. This is apparent in the press here, but Mr. Lopez Portillo, a scholar, novelist and former Minister of Finance, is very careful to avoid inflaming these popular anti‐Yanqui sentiments. He hears all the speculations and controversies about the price of gas, about the flight of young Mexicans to the United States, about abortion and the church and the state. Give us time, he says. Let us talk, yes, about the immediate critical problems, but also about the middleand long‐range problems. “Everything has a solution,” he says. “A problem stated in its proper terms always finds a solution ... No surprise, no abuse, no imbalance, no situation that is not dignified. If we do have such a climate, then everything can be solved.” On the immediate U.S.‐Mexican controversy over the price of Mexican gas, Washington's position is that: (1 Mexican gas at an appropriate price is a desirable source of supplemental U.S. energy supply; The price of distillate fuel oil in New York Harbor is not an appropriate price for Mexican gas. 41 The residual fuel oil price is the highest possible competitive price because it is the substitute fuel for Mexican gas in U.S. and Mexican markets. 41 The higher the Mexican price, the greater the transfer of residual gas consumer price benefits to Mexican gas producers. gl Finally, in the U.S. Government's view, premature gas sales at disadvantageous prices in the United States will not be in the long‐term interest of relations between the two countries. But in spite of Washington's preoccupation with all these technicalities, President Lopez Portillo, as I hear him, wants to leave all these questions to the technicians and talk to President Carter about the history and philosophy of the two nations, even about the possibility of a North American customs union or common market, and what can be done to establish a better means of working out common problems. “Let's not be in too much of hurry,” he says. “Then things don't go too well. Napoleon once said to his valet: ‘Please help me to dress slowly because I'm in a hurry.-"
Test‐Tube Conception Clinic Stirs Norfolk Debate,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/07/archives/testtube-conception-clinic-stirs-norfolk-debate-publicity-avoided.html,"NORFOLK, Va., Feb. 6 — While a Government advisory panel struggles with the ethical issues of test‐tube insemination in Washington, a debate on the same question has opened here, the site of the first American clinic for laboratory conception of human life. Dr. Howard W. Jones Jr. and his wife, Dr. Georgeanna Seegar Jones, both of whom had done widely known work in genetics at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, decided to retire here last year and to establish a clinic for conception in vitro — literally, in glass — by techniques pioneered in England last summer. The clinic was set up at the new and little‐known Eastern Virginia Medical School, and at first it caused relatively little dispute in this conservative Tidewater Virginia city. The Joneses, who had been research associates of Dr. Patrick C. Steptoe and Robert G. Edwards, the British pioneers who achieved the first successful conception outside the human body, were brought here and given salaries of $50,000 each through the efforts of Dr_ Mason C. Andrews, a well‐known gynecologist who is also the Vice Mayor of Norfolk and the founder of the five-year-old medical school, only the third in the state. The Joneses and Dr. Andrews, who was a student of theirs at Johns Hopkins Medical School, recruited Jack M. Rary, an authority on genetics from Baltimore, to direct the laboratory that is to be a crucial part of the in vitro procedure. “We want to make this the best medical school we can,” Dr. Andrews said today. Publicity Avoided The Joneses have declined interviews, avoided a flurry of invitations to appear on nationally televised talk shows after the birth of the baby conceived by the Steptoe‐Edwards method, and made few public appearances. Dr. Howard Jones spoke yesterday, however, to a gathering of volunteer women at Norfolk's.General Hospital. lie said that by the year's end he hoped to begin selecting patients for in vitro conception from more than 400 candidates who have written him from across the country. Dr. Jones, 68 years old, is a tall, grayhaired, reserved man who wears muted clothing and avoids controversy. To hospital volunteer who asked him yesterday about the possible abortion of any abnormal fetuses produced by the in vitro procedure, Dr. Jones replied only, “My hunch is that this will not turn out to be a problem.” What sharpened debate over moral and philosophical questions raised by the procedure was the appearance here yesterday of Dr. Joseph R. Stanton, professor of internal medicine at Tufts Univer‐• sity in Boston and a founder of the Boston‐area Value of Life Committee, a militantly antiabortion group, on a local television program. Later he gave a harshly critical talk before about 300 students and parents at the parish school of • St. Matthew's Roman Catholic Church in nearby Virginia Beach. Dr. Stanton delivered a 45‐minute attack on the introduction into the United States of the Steptoe‐Edwards technique and on the possible grant of Federal re‐’ search money to carry it on. Dr. Jones had ‘told the volunteer women yesterday that his search for $250,000 an grants or gifts to fund his in vitro laboratory here had so far failed to raise “any substantial money,” a development that underlines the debate over the propriety of the Federal grants. The question is now before an Ethics Advisory Board of doctors, theologians and laymen appointed by Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare Joseph A. Califano Jr. The 13‐member ethics board could not reach final agreement at its eighth meeting last weekend and will vote on recommendation to Mr. Califano at another meeting in Washington on March 16. The guidelines tentatively proposed by the ethics board would limit in vitro procedures to “lawfully married couples” and forbid the laboratory life-support of human embryos beyond 14 days. Dr. Stanton, who has urged the ethics board to oppose any Federal aid, did not directly mention the Jones project here. But his assault on the in vitro procedure was sweeping, both as it stands and as it might be developed. Dr. Stanton said that potential abuses of the technique could lead to the laboratory conception of “para‐humans,” and to the implantation of human ova, fertilized by sperm from nonparental donors, in “surrogate mothers” or even in animals. And he denounced the “abortions implicit in Steptoe's work.” Before implantation, patients are asked to sign a consent paper that permits removal of an imperfectly developing fetus from the mother. Dr. Jones's comment today was that those who oppose in vitro conception should not have test‐tube babies, but they should not seek to prevent others from ... doing so.

Carter Health Program Seeks to Hire Abortion Foe,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/08/archives/carter-health-program-seeks-to-hire-abortion-foe-approval-awaited.html,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 7 (AP) — The Carter Administration's fledgling teenage pregnancy program is trying to hire, as a $125‐a‐day consultant, the leader of national organization that opposes abortion. The new program is already caught in a tug‐of‐war between abortion forces opposing abortion and groups that call for family planning and the right to abortion. A spokesman for the United States Public Health Service confirmed yesterday that Lula Mae Nix, head of the adolescent pregnancy office, had asked for approval to hire Marjory Mecklenburg, president of American Citizens Concerned for Life Inc. The group has lobbied for a constitutional amendment to outlaw abortion and advocates adoption as one alternative to the procedure. It has compared legalized abortion in the United States to the Nazi Holocaust. The new pregnancy program, enacted in the closing hours of the last Congress, is designed to emphasize prenatal care for pregnant teen‐agers and subsequent assistance for their babies. The law setting up the program requires that all participanth be “informed of the availability of counseling on all options regarding her pregnancy.’ Approval Awaited Shirley Barth, spokesman for the Public Health Service, said Mrs. Mecklenburg's appointment was awaiting approval from Dr. Julius Richmond, Assistant Secretary of Health in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. The pregnancy office wants to hire Mrs. Mecklenburg “because she is very good in the area of community develop. ment and mobilizing resources,” Miss Barth said. Mrs. Mecklenburg, of St. Paul, could not be reached for comment. Miss Barth said the office “expects to hire other consultants from other spectra” in the field, including family planning groups. But she said she did not know the name of anyone under consideration. An estimated one million teen‐age pregnancies occur in the United States each year, the vast majority unwanted or unintended. About 40 percent of all teenage pregnancies now end in abortion. Groups opposiing abortion stress prenatal care for pregnant girls and subsequent assistance for their babies as the principal ways to deal with the problem of pregnant teen‐agers. Family planning and abortion rights groups stress pregnancy prevention efforts, particularly birth control, to solve the problem."
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/10/archives/letters-foreign-policy-and-the-national-interest.html,"To the Editor: Recent letters to the editor by Max Spector, M.J. Peterson and James Lazerow raise anew the question which has divided scholars since Hans Morgenthau published “In Defense of the National Interest” a quarter century ago: Is there a predetermined national interest which ought to guide policy makers in the formulation of foreign policy? Or is the national interest the result of a political process in which competing views are weighed and a decision is ultimately made about- what goals the United States should strive for in its external environment? I share Professor Peterson's view that “national interest is whatever government and a people decide it will be.” But leaving it there does not provide policy makers with any tools to analyze the range of interests (stake) which the United States, and all major powers, have in dealing with the world. Traditionally, scholars and policy makers could agree that defense of territory, enhancement of the nation's economic well‐being and creation of favorable world order.were basic na- tional interests of most countries. But what about a nation's value system? Should the Soviet Union's desire to spread Marxism‐Leninism throughout the world be considered part of its national \b}interest, or separate and distinct? Was Wilsonian idealism about League of Nations keeping the peace a part of the United States’ national interest or an aberration? It seems to me that ideology (a nation's value system) is part of its national interest, a driving force behind its foreign policy, even though it may not always be given the same support as defense, economic and world‐order interests. President Carter's emphasis on human rights in foreign policy is not an infringement on the U.S. national interest, as Morgenthau and Kerman and others would argue: It is a reiteration of the fact that the United States has always stood for something more than power in the world arena, even though this aspect of U.S. interests has been largely submerged for the past 30 years. Recent events in Iran should remind us again of the powerful role that religion plays in determining the national interests of some states. Is it not time that American scholars and policy makers accept the notion that national value systems, or ideology, are playing an increasingly important role in international politics? DONALD E. NUECHTERLEtN Professor of International Affairs Federal Executive Institute Charlottesville, Va., Feb. 1, 1979 To Make Prescription Drugs Affordable To the Editor: The Feb. 1 letter by C. Joseph Stetler. president of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, is a spe‐: cious collection of weak points in favor of brand‐name pharmaceuticals versus generics. None of his arguments will impress the patient with a low‐ebb pocketbook who looks to those generic prepartions which conform in quality and efficacy to U.S.P. [United States Pharmacopeia) standards. The sole reality which must impress every fair‐minded consumer regardless of his economic standing is the brand manufacturer's right to be adequately compensated for his years of costly research. It's not for me to say whether development costs should be applied against the manufacturer's total gross profits or should be charged against the specific drug thus evolved. The manufacturer has a right to recover his expenses while his uniqueness of product (i.e. his patent) still prevails. But once in the public domain or generic or licensed to other manufacturers, a pharmaceutical product -- as opposed to a luxury item — must be within the economic reach of every citizen. Of course, everyone knows the reason for price differential of one and the same drug from one retailer to another. The small, independent pharmacist who must buy one vial at a time cannot possibly compete against the co‐op or chain establishment, whose common buying office orders by the case lot. The solution to that problem is in sight: More and more independents are joining cooperatives. The problem is manifold and complex. Nothing will be resolved overnight. But the brand‐name manufacturers must first become more realistic in their efforts to “sell” the public. They must acknowledge that illness the need for drugs — cuts across economic strata, geography, language barriers and education. Hence, they must concentrate their arguments and P.R. on those points which are intelligible to all, and with which everyone can identify. ARTHUR BODENHEIMER River Edge, N.J., Feb. 1, 1979 Those Killer Ads To the Editor: In two editorials nearly three years apart, your condemnation of cigarettesmoking was impressive. The first appeared on Feb. 20, 1976, (“Nails for Female Coffins”) in which you deplored the increases in “lung, bronchial and other cancers associated with cigarette smoking” and called the statistics on smoking “dismaying.” The second was your lead editorial of last Jan. 12, “Those Killer Cigarettes,” in which you refer to the “danger” of smoking, and express no surprise at Secretary Califano's conclusion that smoking is far more dangerous than was supposed in 1964. You state that “the weeds are killing more than 350,000 Americans each year” and pose the question, “How can the nation break its cigarette habit?” In view of your stated dismay and concern, I find it singularly curious that paid cigarette advertising appeared in both of those issues, and continues to appear virtually every day. I offer a suggestion. Perhaps one way to help solve the problem would be for The Times to end its double standard and discontinue all advertising of such potential killers. Some other publications took this advanced step as long as 15 years ago. JOSIAH B. WAY Stanton, N.J., Jan. 31, 1979 A Woman's Choice To the Editor: In his Feb. 4 letter, “Abortion: The Forgotten Fathers,” Jerome Davison proposes a “return to the age‐old morality that demands that the father take responsibility for the mother and child.” How does Mr. Davison propose a woman gain this support ‐paternity suits and shotgun marriages? Women have learned that they cannot depend on the support of men, be it political or financial. A woman must have the power to make decisions which are amenable to her own life. This includes the right to choose abortion, and to have that abortion funded if she cannot pay for it herself. Without this control over her life, control without dependency on a man for financial support, the word “equality” is mean-- ingless. ELIZABETH WHITEHEAD New York, Feb. 4, 1979 The Executioners To the Editor: Who says New York does not have capital punishment? We never lost it. Of course, it changed from a responsible legal administration of the death penalty to the do-it-yourself category. Now a frightened storekeeper packs a weapon under the counter, a policeman decides in milliseconds whether to kill or be killed, a crime victim may be lucky enough to seize the criminal's weapon and do what our sophisticated legal system considers too barbaric deed for our “enlightened” society to perform. You say capital punishment doesn't stop murder or forcible rape? Try to convince (if you could reach) the second and subsequent murder victim or the second and subsequent rape vic- tim. JOHN D. MEEHAN Rockville Centre, N.Y., Jan. 31, 1979 To Foil Graffiti Artists To the Editor: One way to clean up the graffiti mess in the subways might be to sell more advertising, both inside and outside the cars. Graffiti artists tend to regard advertising posters as sacrosanct, or the posters’ impermanence gives them less appeal as a surface for the art work. Taking up more and more of potential graffiti areas with advertising posters seems the lesser of two evils and might even bring in much‐needed revenue. PAUL. R. GREEN Westport, Conn., Jan. 31.1979 Rearguard Action To the Editor: Alas and alack; I grieve and wring my hands; I shake my head in disbelief. In your lead editorial of Jan. 30 you say “raring to go.” No, no, a thousand times no! Say anything, but say it isn't so. Say you did it to test the readership, or whatever comes to mind, but please say you always knew it was “rearing to go,” derived from a skittish horse who rears on his hind legs for whatever personal reasons he has to be off and rearin’ to go. Woe is me. HY GROBER Teaneck, N.J., Jan. 30, 1979 ‘If Mediocrity Is Good Enough for . . .’ To the Editor: In his otherwise excellent recent article about the consequences of cutting “frills,” Fred Hechinger is grossly unfair to those of us who stumble along in our mediocrity when he allies himself with School Chancellor Macchiarola's statement that “school systems could do a far better job of teaching if they stopped condoning mediocrity among administrators and teachers.” Here we are, the masses, the overwhelming — occasionally known as “silent” — majority striving mightily for mediocrity. Our simple motto embedded on a slateboard gray: “Neither into a pothole step, nor over a manhole cover stumble,” and along come Hechinger and Macchiarola wanting us to be “successful.” Unfair! If mediocrity is good enough for automobile manufacturers who can't create a car that isn't called back and who are still considered the backbone of our nation; if mediocrity is good enough for the steel industry which can't compete against imports; if mediocrity is good enough for Big Business which wants to be subsidized and tariff‐protected and receive a tax deduction for a three‐martini lunch; mediocrity is good enough for most of our hospitals and most of our politicians and most of New York's sports teams — why, by golly, being average, being ordinary, being plain downhome mediocre should be good enough teachers and administrators. After all, who but a mediocrity would tolerate for so long the increasing physical violence of those supposed to be educated and the verbal violence of those who should know better? Besides, that great mediocrity Senator Hruska from Nebraska thought a mediocre Supreme Court justice was just what America's mediocre masses needed. So emon, fellas. Be fair to us common folk. Give mediocrity a chance. WILLIAM J. HUNTER Brooklyn. Feb. 3, 1979 The Handicapped's Right to Public Transport To the Editor: Much of the recent publicity about the efforts of handicapped people to secure accessible public transportation dwells on the cost of rehabilitating currently inaccessible buses and subways or purchasing newly designed vehicles without describing their benefits to society. Opponents of mandated accessibility try to make the claims of handicapped people seem meaningless and unrealistic compared with the “practical” calculations of transit companies. In fact, the economic benefits of accessible buses and subways far outweigh the costs because they extend not only to Wheelchair users but also to older people, parents with small children, pregnant women and people with broken legs. For example, the Urban Mass Transportation Administration has determined that the accessible bus known as Transbus will be less liable to costly accidents and will be worth the investment of Federal transportation funds because the Federal Government will save millions of S.S.I. and other disability payments as many recipients of such payments become working taxpayers. Opponents of expenditures for accessible transportation belittle the aspirations of handicapped people to come and go tike anyone else; this view undoubtedly comes from stereotyped attitudes about handicapped people, reinforced by nearly total separation from them. However, many of the same people would surely claim to support the recent advances in the rights of other groups to participate freely in all the affairs of society. Handicapped people demand their civil rights as well.

Vote ‘Report Cards’ Find New Patterns,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/11/archives/long-island-weekly-vote-report-cards-find-new-patterns-vote-report.html,"WASHINGTON REPRESENTATIVE Jerome A. Ambro, third‐term Democratic Representative from East Northport, says that Americans for Democratic Action, the liberal lobbying group, could render its best service to the country by simply going out of business. Reacting angrily to the group's latest “report card” on how members of Congress vote on key issues, Mr. Ambro, who received a grade of 20 out of a possible 100, snapped: “I don't consider A.D.A. important. It's not significant where 1 come from. don't think anybody pays a damned bit of attention to them.” By the A.D.A.'s grading standards, Mr. Ambro voted “wrong” on 16 of 20 key domestic and foreign issues in 1978. His score of 20 percent “right” contrasts with the 89 percent A.D.A. rating Mr. Ambro received in 1975, his freshman year. The drop since then was by far the greatest of any New York State Representative as calculated by the A.D.A. But Mr. Ambro's three Democratic colleagues in the Long Island Congressional delegation also had substantial declines in their A.D.A. ratings between 1975 and 1978. Otis G. Pike of Riverhead, who did not seek re‐election last fall, dropped from 84 In 1975 to 35 last year. Thomas J. Downey of West Islip, who achieved a 100 A.D.A. rating in his freshman year, 1975, skidded to 60 in 1978; and Lester L. Wolff of Great Neck declined from 79 to 65 in the same period. The national director of the A.D.A., Leon Shull, noted that Congress, after the civil rights struggles and antiwar issues of the 1960's and early 1970's, had become more conservative. The new members now coming in, he said, are frequently of a mind that government has got too big, that there are too many regulations and too much spending. But Mr. Shull also contended that many Representatives are influenced unduly by “negative single‐issue pressure groups,” such as those opposing abortion or forced busing. In the period from 1975 to 1978, Mr. Ambro's voting rating with two major conservative groups — Americans for Constitutional Action and the American Conservative Union — rose by identical amounts, from 22 to 35 percent “right” But Mr. Ambro said he believed that such ratings — liberal or conservative — are “counterproductive,” if not worthless, and invited the conservative groups to join the A.D.A. in closing up shop. Mr. Ambro said there had been no major change in his political position since 1975. What is his position? “Why, I straddle the broad middle ground,” he said. According to Mr. Ambro, the A.D.A. “contrived” its 1975 report cards to produce a very liberal record and to “pat itself on the back” for a good record, especially with the freshman class of 1975, which was considered especially liberal. So much depended, he said, on the selection of 20 votes out of perhaps 600 or 700 and their designation as “key issues” on which members of Congress are graded. Although Mr. Ambro was rated “wrong” 16 out of 20 times by the A.D.A. in 1978, a majority of the six Long Island Representatives voted the same way in 14 of those 16 cases. The Island's two Republican Representatives received consistently low grades on A.D.A. charts in recent years. John W. Wydler of Garden City dipped from a 39 in 1974 to 26 in 1975, touched a low point of only 5 percent in 1976 and scored 10 in 1978. In contrast, his American Conservative Union rating last year was 82, and Americans for Constitutional Action had him “right” 68 percent of the time. Norman F. Lent of East Rockaway had an A.D.A. score of 26 in 1975 and has received 20's each year since. But his A.C.U. grade reached 86 last year, and his A.C.A. score was 75. Here is a look at how Mr. Ambro—and other Long Islanders — went “wrong” on some of the 1978's key issues, according to the A.D.A.: ¶By voting against the proposed constitutional amendment to give the District of Columbia voting representation in Congress, including two Senators and at least one Representative. Representatives Pike and Wydler also got A.D.A. demerits by opposing this measure. ¶ By voting for tuition tax credits in the case of tuition for private elementary and secondary schools. Representatives Lent, Wydler and Wolff voted the same way. ¶By voting with the 227‐to‐122 House majority to prohibit use of Federal funds for abortions unless the life of the mother would be endangered by allowing the pregnancy to run its course. Mr. Ambro was joined by Representatives Pike, Lent and Wydler in favoring this prohibition. ¶By favoring a proposal to allow states to rescind their earlier ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. Messrs. Pike, Lent and Wydler also ‐voted for the plan. ¶By going along with the majority of the House in voting for the $16.3 billion tax‐cut bill and for production of the neutron bomb, as well as against transferring more than $7.5 billion from the Defense Department to housing and social programs, and against deleting $2 billion for a nuclear aircraft carrier. ■"

Letter: On the Letelier Murder,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/12/archives/letter-on-the-letelier-murder-presumptions-of-guilt.html,"To the Editor: In a Feb. 3 editorial on the Orlando Letelier assassination you again urged the quick extradition of three former high Chilean intelligence officials who were indicted in this country last year on still unproved and unsubstantiated charges of having ordered Mr. Letelier's murder. The editorial (like most stories The Times has published on the case) implies strongly that these three former officials are guilty. They have not been proved guilty by a court of law in either the United States or in Chile and, according to the basic legal tenets of both nations, must be presumed innocent. However, they do stand accused by the American adventurer Michael Townley, who claims employment at various times during his career by both the C.I.A. and the Chilean DINA and proudly admits having planted the bomb that killed Mr. Letelier and his American aide, Mrs. Ronni Moffitt. For this dreadful murder, and in return for “helping” the prosecution, Townley will serve no more than 40 months in prison. For such an extraordinarily lenient sentence, any observer would conclude, Townley would testify to anything to “help” the prosecution. It is interesting to note that the Chilean Government extradited Townley with no fuss and on the request of the United States Government. What would The Times's editorial position be if a foreign nation demanded the extradition of former C.I.A. chiefs Richard Helms and/or James Schlesinger and/or William Colby and/or George Bush to answer testimony to be presented against these C.I.A. leaders which would be as valid as Townley's against the Chilean intelligence officials? We deplore the murder of Mr. Letelier and Mrs. Moffitt. We are certainly as anxious as The Times to see the perpetrators brought to justice rather than let off with less than 40 months. However, the Nuremberg approach suggested by The Times must be considered as empty and facile a gesture as Chile's demanding the extradition of former C.I.A. Chief William Colby for “crimes” committed in Chile before, during and after the overthrow of Salvador Allende's abortive Marxist regime. MARVIN LIEBMAN Secretary pro tem American‐Chilean Council New York, Feb. 5, 1979 Letters To Punish Officer Torsney To the Editor: I feel that a dangerous precedent is being set in the case of Police Officer Torsney (news story Feb. 6). Several years ago, the International Psychiatric Association condemned the Soviet Union for using psychiatric confinement as a punishment for crimes against the state. The psychiatrists were right in doing so, and they should be equally critical of the decision of the Appellate Division in the case of the white police officer acquitted in the killing of a black youth by reason of temporary insanity. The initial court decision was that Officer Torsney, being a victim of psychomotor equivalency epilepsy, was not responsible when he pulled the trigger. It was on the basis of this diagnosis alone, and not that of personality disorder, that he was committed to Creedmore Psychiatric Center. It was on the basis of this diagnosis alone that be was released from psychiatric treatment. Now the courts are questioning Creedmore's decision to release Mr. Torsney. Perhaps they are questioning what many have long perceived to be an insult to justice in his acquittal. The courts are looking to the mental health system to mete out the punishment they belatedly feel Mr. Torsney deserves, ignoring the fact that he has been treated for the condition initially diagnosed and found capable of returning to society, although happily not in his former capacity. It is an old proverb in the field of psychology that if you assemble 100 psychiatrists on a cold day, at least one of them will say that it is warm outside. Now, the courts have found just such a person, who claims that Torsney also has a personality disorder, which was not in evidence at the time of the trial. We must not allow the courts to use the mental health system as a surrogate form of punishment for those they either cannot or choose not to convict.

Man vs. Animals: The Worse Offense To the Editor: With reference to Clifford Albertson's Feb. 6 letter on hunting and the article which prompted it, I must say in all fairness that while hunting is gross, animal husbandry is far more inhumane. One would hope that in the wilds animals live together in herds or families. The young stay with their mothers until they are old enough to leave. The animals eat their natural diets and are free to roam. In contrast, animal husbandry separates the young from their parents prematurely in many cases — veal for example. The animals are strictly confined and must follow farm protocol. Unlike their free‐roaming counterparts, farm animals are reduced to nothing more than factoried units. Pigs, clean‐living by their nature, are forced to live in dirty pens, which mistakenly reinforce their reputation; chickens, four to a cage; cattle separated from their calves; minks kept in cages. Is this humane? Is it really worse to live your life free as a bird to one day be felled by a bullet? Or is it better to live your life regulated by the farmer, kept in cages, fed antibiotics and tranquiliz ers, periodically removed from one environment to another only to face certain death at the hands of a butcher? PAUL OBIS Editor/Founder, Vegetarian Times New York, Feb. 6, 1979 Keep the Trains Running To the Editor: Trains are not like buses. Once they stop running, they cannot start up again the next day. A study of the history of transportation reveals that, should America abandon its national rail network, it may deeply regret the loss in the future. GREGORY BATTCOCK New York, Feb. 5, 1979 Why Joggers Jog To the Editor: Dr. Christiaan Barnard's comment on jogging as a form of masochism, (Notes on People, Feb. 6) shows that you shouldn't necessarily let a leading cardiac surgeon advise you on either masochism or jogging: • While one indeed has to run a good distance to use up calories (about 800 per hour), the fact is that most confirmed joggers are not overweight. • No jogger with any sense runs on a street that is polluted by gas fumes, except perhaps to get to and from where he does his jogging. • Most joggers I know jog because they enjoy it and because it makes them feel good. They also hope that it may keep them out of Dr. Barnard's waiting room but realize that the last word on this is not yet in. A final note: Anyone who jogs around his lawn has yet to discover the pleasures of jogging. DAVID M. MACDONALD, M.D. Tenafly, N.J., Feb. 6, 1979 New York's Growing Apparel Industry To the Editor: New Yorkers have by nature never been known to shy away from a fight. In that vein we welcome the economic challenge of Atlanta's new apparel mart, just as our Yankees welcomed the challenges of Boston, Kansas City and Los Angeles. I take issue, however, with certain presumptions in Wayne King's Feb. 6 news article. Specifically, he reports that “statistically, it would appear that the exodus of the apparel industry from New York ... is already well established, and the Atlanta effort ... merely takes advantage of an existing trend, rather than creating it.” Recent data (the latest cited in the article are from 1971) simply do not corroborate this thesis. According to the New York State Department of Labor, employment in New York City's apparel industry increased consistently each year from 1975 through 1978. The overall 1975‐78 gain is 5 percent. Individual segments of the industry have shown even greater growth. Fur employment, for instance, went up 20 percent in those years. And business in this field is so promising that the International Fur Fair will this year for the first time hold its annual meeting in New York City. One might also wonder why, if the apparel industry in New York City is indeed gasping its last, the city's Department of Employment is studying a training program to help fill 5,000 potential jobs. If, as reported in the article, Atlanta's emissaries have come to “pick the bones of New York,” they may find a very lively corpse. HERBERT P, RICKMAN New York, Feb. 7,1979 The writer, a special assistant to Mayor Koch, is chairman of the New York City Apparel Task Force. The Wrong Remedy For a Prison Jam To the Editor: Again New York talks about overcrowded prisons, and again New York looks in the wrong place for answers. A Feb. 1 article detailed how Governor Carey has approved a plan to take over Rikers Island and build two 512bed prisons upstate at enormous cost to the taxpayer. Meanwhile, thousands of offenders who because of the petty nature of their crimes pose no danger to the community languish in prisons many miles from their homes. It would make more sense if we determined, as Minnesota has, how many of these non‐dangerous offenders could be punished outside prison walls at far less cost. Then we could worry about building new prisons. The article also mentioned that Ossining prison, which the Governor says is to be phased out, is being renovated at a cost approaching $10 million. Officials claim this is merely as a safety valve. But I wonder if increasing prison populations, spurred by tougher laws that do nothing to ease street crime, will not again be used as an excuse to keep the antiquated prison's financial burden on the shoulders of New York State residents. LOVETT S. GRAY Bronx, Feb. 1,1979 Pope John Paul II: A Voice for Basic Christian Concepts To the Editor: In reference to your Jan. 30 editorial “A Voice Against ‘Liberation Theology,’ “ I for one did not find Pope John Paul II's stand on priestly activity in politics “disappointing.” It seemed a reaffirmation of some basic Christian concepts. Nowhere in Jesus’ teaching does he urge his disciples to minister to human wants and needs of a material nature. Nor does he call for the reform of social and political structures. (Surely the Roman Empire was oppressive). Rather he instructed his followers to bring the “Good News” of Christ to all the nations that they might reform their moral and spiritual lives, thus inheriting everlasting life. Surely there are enough people and institutions on this earth catering to the material and physical wants and needs of society. However, there are only a few ministering to the spiritual needs of mankind without getting sidetracked into political activism. On the question of the usefulness of prayer: Prayer is the most powerful weapon a Christian possesses to overcome human problems, be it social injustice, hunger, poverty or any other trouble. In Jesus’ words, “Ask and you shall receive.” It should follow then that the Pope, as the head of the church started by Jesus Christ, should urge all priests not to get involved in social and political issues but rather to deal with the moral and spiritual needs of all mankind. As every Christian believes the soul and spirit are everlasting, this would seem a much worthier endeavor. This letter, written from the spiritual point of view, might not make any sense to a nonbeliever. However, as you chose to criticize the spiritual leader of Christ's church from the human and physical point of view, I hope you will acknowledge this spiritual Christian rebuttal. JAMES M. BERKERY 3D East Quogue, L.I., Feb. 2, 1979 To the Editor: Contrary to your editorial and several reports of recent dayS, the debate over “liberation theology” does not have to do with whether “Scripture justifies political action” or with whether priests “must confine them selves to the pulpit and altar.” “Liberation theology” is largely a Latin American phenomenon associated with the writings of men such as Gustavo Gutierrez and Juan Luis Segundo, and with the revolutionary activities (praxis) of priests, some of whom have taken up arms in guerrilla movements. It is conventionally based upon an explicitly Marxist analysis of class struggle which its proponents believe should be normative for the Christian church's teaching and life. As Pope John Paul made clear in Mexico, the issue is not whether the church is for liberation. Clearly it is. The issue is how we define liberation. Since Constantine, the church has frequently attempted to establish through direct politieal action what it believed to be a just and Christian society, under auspices both right and left. When, last year, the first John Paul declined to be crowned with the papal tiara and the current Pope followed that precedent, a new era was signaled. The message is that the church has abandoned its pretensions to direct political rule. It will no longer give its uncritical blessing to Caesar or to those who would be the new Caesars. It would be a sad regression for the church that has broken its alliance with the Constantines and Francos of history now to resume its old habits in with Marx. A church that points toward the Kingdom of God, and thus lives in critical tension with all existing or pro posed political orders, can better advance democratic pluralism and more effectively advocate the cause of the poor — who are ever oppressed by political saviors of both the left and the right. That, I believe, is the very progressive manifesto issued by John Paul this past week. RICHARD JOHN NEUHAUS Senior Editor, Worldview New York, Jan. 30, 1979 • To the Editor: I wish you'd make up your mind. When the Catholic Church speaks out against abortion — which you and politicians have unaccountably removed from the moral order to the political order — it is accused of meddling in the affairs of the state. Now, when the Holy Father calls for an end to “liberation theology” and a return of priests to their religious vocation, you call that a disappointment. Thank God for Pope Paul's direct handling of this most important problem. At least he can see clearly that by allowing priests to get involved in political and social activities the church would be reduced to another arm of the state. Each is necessary, but each involves a totally different sphere of activity. The church seeks to provide for the spiritual welfare of man, the state for the temporal. When they work as they are supposed to, we have peace and harmony. (Rev.) THOMAS W. PRIOR Sunnyside, N.Y., Jan. 30, 1979"
BUDGET BALANCERS WARNED BY MUSKIE,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/14/archives/budget-balancers-warned-by-muskie-he-says-amendment-would-result-in.html,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 13 — Voicing the feelings of an increasing number of legislators on Capitol Hill, Senator Edmund S. Muskie of Maine warned today that if the states succeeded in amending the Constitution to mandate a balanced budget, Federal aid to the states would be the primary target of budget cutters. “That's not a threat, but arithmetic,” Mr. Muskie, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said in a luncheon speech at the National Press Club. He called the amendment effort “unworkable, counterproductive and even irresponsible.” He declared that grants‐in‐aid to the states would have to be cut because there was no room for reductions in defense spending, Social Security payments and other major budget categories. A ‘Quick Fix’ Opposed Congress and the executive branch are moving slowly but steadily toward a balanced budget, said Senator Muskie, whose committee is expected to play role in any Congressional consideration of a budget‐balancing amendment. But be argued that neither Congress nor the President should be “handcuffed” by “quick‐fix” mandate that ruled out deficit spending in a recession or by an “illconsidered contrivance” that attempted to establish when a recession was serious enough to permit deficit spending. “Constitutional amendments can't balance the economy,” he said. “Resolutions passed in Richmond or Topeka can't dictate policy in Riyadh or Teheran. Decisions made in Washington's caucus rooms aren't always supported in the board rooms of New York.” Twenty‐seven states — Idaho became the 27th today — have petitioned Congress to take action on a constitutional amendment that would require a balanced budget. Some have called for a convention that would draft the amendment; others have called upon Congress to draft it. In any event, the resulting proposal would require approval by three‐fourths of the states, or 38. Serious Debate Urged Mr. Muskie called for serious debate on the proposal, saying that it had attracted “much attention but little careful thought.” “Some legislatures,” he continued, “have reviewed this proposal with appropriate deliberation. But in many statehouses, prudence has given way to panic. Resolutions to change the Constitution of the United States are introduced at noon and adopted before dinner. “Sometimes without a single hearing, without a review of the alternatives, without as much debate as a new state song would engender, the states endorse a substantial revision of the fundamental law of the land.” Senator Muskie argued that the best way to achieve a balanced budget was to continue the Federal budget process that was begun in the mid‐1970's, in which Congress sets specific spending, revenue and deficit figures that cannot easily be amended once enacted. Discipline Seen Needed “We have made tremendous progress,” he said. “In 1975, the deficit was 3 percent. of our gross national product. But in 1980, it was projected at 1.2 percent. We don't need fiscal handcuffs to wipe the deficit out. We need fiscal discipline. If we have that will, no formula is necessary; if we don't, no formula will work.” Mr. Muskie also saw a danger to the country in mandating a convention to amend the Constitution. He said that the procedures for calling a convention and limiting its agenda were by no means clear. “It's an uncharted course to an unknown destination,” he said. “A balanced budget amendment is only one potential result. There are other popular crusades — to outlaw guns, to outlaw gun control, to make abortion a right, to make abortion a crime, to ban forced busing, to endow forced busing with a specific constitutional sanction, to limit the access of the press, to give the press more access.” In warning the states that grants‐in‐aid would be the first victims of a balancedbudget amendment, Mr. Muskie calculated that the cuts required to put the current budget in the black would total $45 billion. “That would cost more than a million American jobs,” he said. “It might have an impact on inflation, but it would leave the economy far weaker than before.”"
"4,300 Sheep Near Nevada Nuclear Tests Died in ‘53",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/15/archives/4300-sheep-near-nevada-nuclear-tests-died-in-53-a-willful-refusal.html,"SALT LAKE CITY, Feb. 14 (AP) —Nearly 4,300 sheep grazing downwind from Nevada nuclear tests died in the spring of 1953 after absorbing up to 1,000 times the maximum amount of radioactive iodine allowed for human beings, according to Government documents. “If that happened to sheep out here, what about the people that lived in Cedar City, who got a higher dose?” asked Michael Zimmerman, a member of Gov. Scott M. Matheson's radiation committee, which released the papers yesterday. Cedar City, Utah, is 100 miles east of the test site in neighboring Nevada. The 400 documents, most of them from the Federal Government, were released the same day that The Deseret News disclosed a study that concluded that children born in southern Utah in the 1950's, when the nuclear tests were held, died of leukemia at a rate 2½ times higher than the rate of those born before or after the tests. Mr. Zimmerman told reporters some of the documents showed that radiation contributed to the deaths of the sheep. However, he said, despite evidence of high levels of radiation exposure, the Atomic Energy Commission concluded in late 1953 that radiation had not caused the deaths. He said that the documents indicated “a willful refusal” by the commission to investigate the deaths and to determine if high radiation levels might also have affected the health of people. From March 17 to June 4, 1953, the commission conducted 11 atmospheric nuclear tests at the Nevada test site, ac cording to the documents. Such tests ended in 1962. The documents, discovered in the state archives late last year, show that Utah ranchers in November 1952 placed 18,000 sheep on winter grazing land in Lincoln County, Nev. The grazing areas were from a few miles to 120 miles north and east of the borders of the Nevada Proving Grounds. When the sheep were returned to Utah in the spring of 1953, ranchers noted that many were sick and dying. Ewes had spontaneous abortions and showed burnlike lesions on the face, neck and ears. The majority of lambs were born dead and stunted, and ewes died either during lambing or a few days later, according to the documents. A Public Health Service report said that autopsies on June 9 on two ewes showed that the concentration of Iodine 131 in their thyroid glands “exceeds by a factor of 250 to 1,000 the maximum permissible concentration of radioactive iodine for humans.” Bone marrow tests on the same ewes showed radioactive concentrations 50 percent above the maximum allowable level for human beings. However, the report concluded that there was “no direct evidence that radiation could have been the cause” of the deaths of the sheep. Governor Matheson said that the documents contained “some very damning information with respect to the effect of radiation fallout on sheep, and the sheep happened to be in the same area where there were, at that time, numbers of people.” “And we have to assume that the exposure on one was also an exposure on the other,” he added. In a copyright story yesterday, The Deseret News reported on a year‐long study by Dr. Joseph Lyon, co‐director of the Utah Cancer Registry. Dr. Lyon was quoted by The News as saying that from 15 to 20 children died of leukemia who would not have died if the tests had not been held. Dr. Lyon, who declined to comment on the report yesterday, reported on the study to Government scientists in Washington Dec. 12. The study is scheduled for publication Feb. 22 in The New England Journal of Medicine. More than 230 claims have been filed by cancer victims and their families in Utah, Arizona and Nevada with the Department of Energy, which is the successor of the Atomic Energy Commission, charging that the tests had caused cancer and deaths."
News Summary,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/16/archives/news-summary-international.html,"FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1979 Leftist guerrillas in Iran were accused by three top officials of the new Islamic regime of mounting attacks on Government installations and foreign embassies in Teheran with the aim of spreading fear and disorder and undermining the Government. Other assaults, the officials said, were instigated by agents of the supposedly defunct secret police. [Page A1, Column 6.] Iran's Government expressed regret at Washington's decision to begin evacuating most of the remaining Americans from Iran over the weekend, but promised protection and the services needed to move out 1,000 a day. [A10:1‐2.] Washington accused Moscow of efforts to help foment anti‐American actions in Iran and of playing a decisive role in the shootout that led to the slaying of the American ambassador after he had been abducted in Afghanistan. The anger of Government leaders led some officials to predict that chances were dimming for conclusion soon of the arms limitation treaty. [A1 :5.] President Carter sought to counter an impression of coolness and divisiveness that resulted from his opening talks with President José López Fortino in Mexico City. They conferred for three hours on such major issues as Mexican oil and aliens that have divided the two countries. [A1 :3‐4.] A North and South Korean meeting is scheduled this weekend at Panmun??. It will be their first significant contact since 1973. [A4:3‐4.] New variables in global climate have not occurred in recent years, according to the nearly unanimous view of participants at the World Climate Conference in Geneva who have done systematic studies of past records. One scientist said that recent extremes conformed to probability. [D13:1‐2.] National A retrial for Daniel J. Flood, the 75year‐old Pennsylvania Democrat who has served 16 terms in Congress, will be sought by the Justice Department. His first trial on bribery, conspiracy and perjury charges ended Feb. 3 in a hung jury, with only one juror holding out for acquittal on all 11 counts. [A14:5‐6.] California acted illegally when it gave local governments $5 billion last summer to help cover revenue losses from Proposition 13 but forbade use of the funds for raises for public employees, the state Supreme Court held. The ruling left standing some provisions of the “bailout” law, but restored to local governments some of the fiscal decision‐making that the state had tried to remove as a condition of getting the money. [A14 : 1‐2.] Energy conflicts in New England are the deepest in the nation. The disputes, involving environmentalists, utilities, fishermen, farmers, oil companies, businessmen and government agencies, have greatly intensified since the 1973 Arab oil embargo. The nation's inability or unwillingness to resolve energy problems is reflected most in the six states, where 80 percent of energy depends on oil and 79 percent of that oil is imported. [A14:3‐6.] Ways to end sex discrimination in the Social Security System were proposed in a Government study that was hailed by women's groups as a major breakthrough for both working and nonworking women. The 323‐page report was made public by Joseph A. Califano Jr., Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, who acknowledged that benefits in the system were discriminatory and had become outmoded.

Proposed Convention on Balancing Budget,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/16/archives/proposed-convention-on-balancing-budget-the-background.html,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 15 — Twentyseven state legislatures have called on Congress to summon a constitutional convention to draft a constitutional amendment requiring the Federal budget to be balanced except in emergencies. If seven more states join them, Congress may be obliged to call the first such convention since 1787. Issue and Debate While the discussions in most state legislatures have been perfunctory, the subject is getting increasing attention as the total nears the 34 that would make the necessary two‐thirds of the states, and three lines of debate are emerging, as follows: ??Whether a requirement for a regularly balanced budget is a good idea in itself. ??Whether such a requirement should be in the Constitution. ??Whether a constitutional convention is the best place to write such an amendment, and, even if it may be, whether a convention might not run wild and try to change the fundamental elements of the Constitution. Congressional Democrats generally answer “no” to the three questions implicit in the lines of debate. President Carter says he favors a balanced budget, opposes constitutional conventions and urges that the idea of an amendment be approached “very gingerly, very carefully.” Republicans here almost universally oppose a convention, argue for balanced budgets as a goal but split about whether an amendment would be appropriate. Many prefer an amendment that would limit only Federal spending, which more easily controlled than tax revenue. In the remaining states, however, support for the convention effort generally comes from Republican legislators. The Federal convention of 1787 fixed on two methods for amending the Constitution. On 32 occasions Congress has used one route and proposed amendments to the states. Five were not ratified by the necessary three‐fourths of the legislatures. and one, the equal rights amendment, is still pending. The other course, a convention called by Congress on the request of the states, has never been used. In two cases, however, the legislatures came within one state of the needed two‐thirds. Early in this century that pressure contributed to Congressional proposal of the amendment requiring the direct election of senators. Then, in the late 1960's, Congress held fast against an effort to undo the Supreme Court's reapportionment decision. While attacks on deficit spending have been a political commonplace for many years, the current effort began seriously in 1975 when State Senator James Clark of Maryland pushed a convention call through his Legislature and began talking up the idea with other state lawmakers. He also enlisted the backing of the National Taxpayers Union, a small organization best known until now for attacks on foolish‐sounding Federal grants and on double‐dipping by military pensioners on the Federal payroll. The convention campaign gathered steam in the last couple of years. It has been helped along by rampant inflation, which 58 percent of the public in the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll think could be curbed by cuts in Federal spending. Since most states are required to have balanced budgets (though usually by accounting methods very different from Federal practices), the idea has until recently met little opposition. Recently, most of the states that approved a convention call have offered Congress a way out — writing an amendment itself — as they sought to reassure those who argued that a convention might go haywire. The Supporters' Case James D. Davidson, chairman of the National Taxpayers Union, contends that deficits spur inflation and devalue the currency. He argues that emergency clauses could cope with the needs of war and depression. Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, the most prominent political supporter of the drive, goes further, seeing a balanced budget as a philosophical symbol for “the kind of discipline this country needs.” Mr. Davidson maintains that without a constitutional injunction members of Congress will be unable to withstand the temptation to spend more than they are willing to tax to pay for. While most of the supporters say they are using the convention call only as a “club” to get Congress's attention, Mr. Davidson says he has no fear that it would run wild, feeling that Congress and the courts would enforce the calls from most of the states that make it clear this is the only subject they want considered. In any case, he says, the necessary 38 states would not ratify wild amendments from a convention. And he argues that a caliber of delegate comparable to those who met in Philadelphia in 1787 would be chosen for a new convention. The Opponents' Case Critics such as Senators Edmund S. Muskie of Maine and John C. Culver of Iowa, both Democrats, insist that, while balanced budgets are a worthy ideal, any binding requirement would be too inflexible and would make it hard for Congress to react quickly and head oft a depression when an economic downturn began. They contend that the states that are demanding a balanced budget are hypocritical, getting 380 billion in Federal aid. They warn, with arguments that are beginning to be heard in state capitals, that revenue sharing and other grants would be cut first. Some foes maintain that deficits have little effect on inflation anyway and that economic theory should not be embedded in the Constitution, because it would be stuck there even if the theory proved wrong. Others say that this sort of detail does not belong in a statement of great principles. But the most effective argument the critics have is the fear of a runaway convention. Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana, chairman of the Senate's Constitutional Amendments Subcommittee, says he thinks Congress could limit a convention, but he is not sure. While legal scholars are found on both sides of the issue, opponents point out that the original convention went beyond its mandate and say they do not want to run the risk of turmoil and uncertainty that efforts to rewrite the basic law of free press, free speech or abortion would raise. The Outlook It now appears more likely than not that sometime this year the necessary 34th state will call for a convention, even though Congress has not received, or cannot find, some of the earlier resolutions. That confusion has led some Congressmen to contend that as few as 14 states have passed resolutions, but there is no reason to doubt that additional copies will be forwarded to Capitol Hill. This problem is probably a reflection of the fact that Congress has never set up precise procedures for dealing with such resolutions. In fact, only the Senate has ever considered legislation to regulate an actual convention. It passed such measures twice but the House took no action. Despite the mandatory language of the Constitution that Congress “shall call a convention” once two‐thirds of the states ask for one, the fact that most of the resolutions give Congress the alternative of proposing its own amendment will blunt, for a time, any requirement for an immediate convention call. When and if the 34th state signs up Congress is likely to get seriously at work on a budget‐balancing amendment of its own, with as much flexibility as it can manage, and on a revival of legislation to govern convention procedures. But the issue will not go away, and even the amendment's severest critics are aware of its strong public support, recorded by 73 percent of those in the Times/CBS News Poll."
Abortion Clinic Set Afire on L.I.,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/16/archives/abortion-clinic-set-afire-on-li-suspect-is-held-scene-of.html,"A man with a can of gasoline and a torch set fire to a crowded abortion clinic in Hempstead, L.I., yesterday afternoon, sending 40 to 50 staff members and patients fleeing into th,e cold as flames heavily damaged the two‐story, 12‐room clinic and burned the arson suspect. Identified by the Hempstead police as Peter I. Burkin, about 25 years old, of 330 West 51st Street, Manhattan, the suspect was the only casualty, suffering seconddegree burns of both hands as the flames leaped around him in the Bill Baird clinic at 107 Main Street, in Hempstead's business district. On the basis of a description, he was captured by Police Officer Thomas Moore behind a building at 138 North Franklin Avenue, about a block from the scene of the fire. He was taken to the Nassau County Medical Center in East Meadow, L.I. Charges were expected to be filed by the Nassau County Police. Several staff members of the clinic said they had seen the man at some of the eight to 10 anti‐abortion demonstrations outside the clinic last year. The police said Mr. Burkin had possibly used other names. They described him as unemployed and said that when he was taken into custody he had expressed strong feelings against abortion. Anti‐abortion groups have been very active on Long Island, and there have been repeated, though nonviolent, demonstrations outside the Hempstead clinic, which only this week had been fitted with bulletproof glass in its front window and bulletproof steel interior doors. Several extra fire extinguishers were kept on hand because of threats and fears arising out of fires at other such clinics in the country. The Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Division of the Federal Treasury Department recorded 13 instances of abortion clincs burned in the United States last year. “It was amazing that no one else was hurt,” said. Dr. Gerald Zutnick, 36, who was performing an abortion when a man walked into the reception room of the clinic at 4:52 P.M. carrying a plastic antifreeze can full of gasoline and a flaming stick. The police later said he had purchased the gasoline at a service station next door to the clinic. “This place is going up — don't anybody move, I have gasoline and I'm going to burn this place down,” the man was said to have shouted as he splashed gasoline over the rug of the reception room. A receptionist, a score of medical and administrative staff members and at least as many patients and others fled, some from a basement and some from second‐floor treatment and counseling rooms. All left through a hallway leading to a back door, said Dr. Zutnick, who called the evacuation orderly and praised the staff members who directed it. He said that as the evacuation was under way he ran toward the front and found Gary Nielsen, the husband of one of the nurses, at a doorway between the reception area in the front and treatment rooms in the back. The doctor said Mr. Nielsen was attempting to hold the door closed against the arsonist, who was trying to push his way through and was splashing gasoline into the doorway."
Birth Control Parley Shaken as Protesters Display Two Fetuses,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/16/archives/birth-control-parley-shaken-as-protesters-display-two-fetuses.html,"WASHINGTON. Feb. 15 — A peacemaking effort by opposing sides of the abortion issue to establish common ground on alternative means of birth control suffered a sharp setback today when three women interrupted a news conference and displayed two human fetuses. Speakers from both sides had earlier termed a previous five‐hour meeting as “amicable” and “productive” and announced that a unanimous consensus had been reached on “the need for expanded reproductive education by parents, schools and religious groups.” The National Organization for Women sponsored the meeting, which was attended by representatives of eight antiabortion groups and 20 groups that favor a choice on abortion. Leaders of major antiabortion groups had sharply denounced the meeting, awl Dr. Carolyn F. Gerster, president of the National Right to Life Committee, later said that she fully supported the interruption, which was carried out by People Expressing a Concern for Everyone, a member group of the Right to Life Committee. A wave of revulsion swept through the hundred or so onlookers when the three women stopped before the television lights and thrust open their baby blankets. Visibly shaken and near tears, Eleanor Smeal, president of NOW, said that it was an “isolated incident” that ran counter to the “good atmosphere of the conference.”"
Experimenting With Test‐Tube Babies,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/17/archives/experimenting-with-testtube-babies.html,"The birth last July of Louise Brown, the first baby to be born from a human egg cell fertilized in the laboratory and then implanted in a mother's body, touched off immediate controversy. Critics questioned the ethics and morality of the artificial fertilization procedure. The British researchers responsible for the feat. Drs. Patrick Steptoe and Robert Edwards, were criticized for the unorthodox way in which they announced their success through the general press. Questions also were raised about their failure to reveal full details in a scholarly publication. Some aspects of the procedure have since been clarified; others are still clouded by controversy. From all reports, Louise is a healthy, normal baby, and so too is an infant born in Glasgow after similar laboratory fertilization. In San Francisco recently, at an American Fertility Society conference, Dr. Steptoe gave his peers the most detailed description yet of the technique. The impression he left is that the procedure is still far from routine and still requires what he called “a lot of fine tuning.” But it seems likely that the technique will be perfected in the next few years and become available for general use. One major debate in this country is whether Government funds ought to be used to finance such experimentation. The Ethics Advisory Board of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare says yes, tenta tively, given such guidelines as limiting artificial fertilization to “lawfully married couples.” Others, however, oppose such experiments. They believe that each fertilized egg is a human being, and are appalled that in the Steptoe‐Edwards technique several eggs may have to be fertilized and then destroyed before a satisfactory result is obtained for implantation in the mother. In fact, the Steptoe‐Edwards technique conforms to the standards that were established by the Supreme Court six years ago for assessing the legality of abortion. Another argument involves potential misuse of the procedure; the fertilized egg might be implanted in a woman other than the donor of the original egg cell, a “surrogate mother.” Such a possibility does exist, but the way to guard against it is not by outlawing a valuable new method for helping women with serious problems to conceive. The right way is to create a set of rules, whether by law or by an ethical code for physicians, which would place limits on using such techniques, with penalties for violations. Experimentation in this field is justified; the problem of infertility is a serious medical matter. The Steptoe‐Edwards technique may prove to be a valuable means of helping couples who could not otherwise have children."
Head of Burned Abortion Clinic Trades Charges With Opponent,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/17/archives/head-of-burned-abortion-clinic-trades-charges-with-opponent.html,"HEMPSTEAD, L.I., Feb. 16 — The founder of the Bill Baird abortion clinic on Main Street here and the president of a Long Island Right to Life organization have blamed each other for the fire that destroyed the clinic yesterday when a man barged into the corner storefront with a lighted torch and a can of gasoline. Mr. Baird said that he had received calls from supporters “all over the country,” who were so angry about the fire that they said that they wanted to retaliate by firebombing the Right to Life headquarters or even a Roman Catholic church, but that he had counseled against that. Standing today in the charred, cold, wet building from which 50 patients, counselors, nurses and doctors escaped unhurt yesterday, Mr. Baird said the fire was the responsibility of the Roman Catholic Church and antiabortion organizations such as Right to Life, because they use such terms as “murderers” and “baby killers” in their denunciations of his clinic and others such as it. “I hold them responsible for what happened here yesterday,” said Mr. Baird, the pioneer abortion advocate who opened the clinic 12 years ago. “What can you expect? This kind of thing is bound to happen and I am calling on them to stop using the rhetoric which calls us murderers and baby killers, which I believe are the sorts of hateful words which cause just this kind of thing.” Mr. Baird said that the clinic, which treats mostly young, low‐income women, would reopen as soon as possible, and that he expected to have resources to give pregnancy tests by Monday in the empty offices next door to the center, which the clinic has temporarily rented. John Mawn, president of the Long Island Coalition for Life, one of the organizations in the Right to Life coalition, said the fire was the responsibility of those involved in the abortions there. “Obviously, I deplore the violence and I am relieved that it was not a more serious tragedy. Our goal is to respect human life,” said Mr. Maven. “But he (Mr. Baird) must bear the full responsibility for what happened because he has opened up a place like that which does, no matter what phrases you use — and we do not use the word murderer — destroy human life.” The Rev. John Bennett, secretary to Bishop John McGann of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre, said: “Right to Life advocates come from all (religious) denominations. I have been a priest for eight years, and I have never used that type of rhetoric from the pulpit nor have I heard it.” Mr. Mawn denied that the suspect who was arrested, Peter Burkin, who said he was 21 years old and lived in Manhattan, was a member of his organization, al ‘though some employees of the abortion center said they had seen him with a group of pickets a few weeks ago."
Baby in Malpractice Suit Was Put Up for Adoption,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/17/archives/baby-in-malpractice-suit-was-put-up-for-adoption-call-from-adoptive.html,"The Long Island couple who sued their doctors for the cost of lifetime care of their retarded baby, and won a landmark court ruling holding that doctors could sometimes be liable for such costs, gave up their daughter for adoption during the course of their lawsuit. The child was adopted last October by another Long Island couple, who thereby took full legal responsibility for her future care. The adoption casts uncertainty on the future of the natural parents’ current lawsuit against the doctors — a suit that at first had seemed to raise the possibility of a record‐breaking multimillion‐dollar verdict, The child, who is now 3 years old. suffers from Down's syndrome, commonly known as mongolism. The natural parents, Dolores and Arnold Becker, did not disclose the adoption of the girl, who is named Barbara, during any of the court proceedings leading to the landmark ruling by the New York State Court of Appeals. The ruling in effect cleared the way for a trial of factual issues such as just what kind of treatment the doctors gave Mrs. Becker. The adoption began to come to light only afterward, when the lawyer for the doctors filed papers in State Supreme Court in Mineola, which would be the trial court for the case. The papers asked that the case be dismissed. The lawyer, Walter F. Wortman, said that after the publicity about the court ruling, a woman telephoned him to say that she and her husband had adopted Barbara after caring for her as a foster child. The lawyer said that the Beckers thus no longer had any legal obligations to the child, and that the the case should therefore be dropped. The Beckers acknowledged in an affidavit filed in the court on Tuesday that they had permitted the authorities to seek adoption. But they said they had not been informed that adoption had actually taken place. The affidavit said: “Due to the emotional distress of Dolores Becker combined with the fact that said Dolores Becker must care for her retarded sister and added to the fact that there are somewhat limited funds available to our family, we did sign papers by which it was our understanding that an attempt would be made to find adoptive parents for Barbara.” A spokesman for the Nassau County Department of Social Services confirmed’ there had been an adoption and that it was final, but it declined to give details. Injuries to Mother Cited The lawyer for the Beckers, John A. Bonina, who said he had not known about the adoption until the issue was raised by Mr. Wortman, asserted there were still’ grounds for going forward in the case, such as physical injuries to Mrs. Becker from the pregnancy and birth, and money that had been spent by the Beckers for Barbara's care. He has asked that Mr. Wortman's motion for dismissal be denied, and the question is to be argued next Friday. The State Court of Appeals ruled that if a doctor failed to advise prospective parents adequately that they faced certain risks of having a defective child, and if such a child was then born, the doctor could be sued for the lifetime special costs of caring for the child. A trial would have to be held on such issues as what advice the doctor gave, and what the accepted medical practice Was in the community, and normal rules of medical malpractice cases would apply. If it was proved that the doctor had been negligent he would be liable to the natural parents for the special costs of the child's upbringing. Prenatal Test Not Performed Mrs. Becker (who was 37 when she Decame pregnant) and her husband sued her doctors on several grounds, both in their own behalf and on behalf of their child. The basic argument was that they had not been told that women over 35 faced a more than normal risk of bearing a child with Down's syndrome, or that a prenatal test called amniocentesis could be performed on the pregnant mother for discovering that defect. The premise was that if they had been so advised, Mrs. Becker would have taken the test, learned of the defect and had an abortion. In their affidavit the parents said that Mrs. Becker was so distressed immediately after the birth, on May 10, 1975, that “she was unable to bring herself to view Barbara Becker and so certainly in no condition to undertake the care of Barbara Becker.” County authortities placed the baby in a foster home. In August 1976 Barbara was placed with the family that ultimately adopted her. The names of the adoptive parents are withheld at the request of their lawyer, Robert Fiseher, Who contends that publicity may harm the child. Barbara in a Special School The family also has two boys, aged 13 and 11, and a girl, 8, all adopted and all normal. Everyone in the family agreed in a “family conference” to adopt Barbara, the adoptive mother said in a recent interview. Barbara goes to a special school for children with Down's syndrome four mornings a week. She has progressed markedly, her adoptive mother said, learning to feed herself, for example, and to speak. She is “gorgeous” and “very affectionate,” her adoptive mother said. Mr. Wortman, the lawyer for the doctors, said in his affidavit that it seemed to him the Beckers had “attempted to perpetrate a travesty upon this court” by proceeding with their lawsuit at the same time they were going ahead with the adoption. “Such reprehensible conduct should not be condoned,” he said. The Beckers, according to Mr. Bonina, their lawyer, decline to speak to reporters. In their affidavit they said they had been paying money to the county regularly for Barbara's care — apparently, foster‐care payments. They also pledged to use any money they won in the lawsuit solely for Barbara. The doctors in the case are Burton D. Garfinkel, Stuart Bednoff and Eugene D. Schwartz of Great Neck, L.I."
Other Regional Events,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/18/archives/other-regional-events-mercury-tests-in-nj.html,"Community fears have been rising so New Jersey health officials began testing 55 people last week for mercury poisoning near a 36‐year‐old dump in Wood‐Ridge. The test area was a 4,000‐foot section of about 60 homes and a few factories. The defunct Wood‐Ridge Chemical Corporation, which processed mercury and its byproducts until it was torn down in 1974, had been within the area. Health officials said it would be a month before results are known. Abortion Clinic Torched The 25th torching of an American abortion clinic came in Hempstead, L.I., last week. A man strolled into a reception area and shouted, This place is going up.” He emptied a can of gasoline and set it ablaze, giving himself second degree burns in the process. Nobody else was hurt, but the clinic — which had just been outfitted with bulletproof glass — was heavily damaged. Later, a block from the clinic, police picked up a suspect, Peter I. Burkin. He was identified as a participant in several antiabortion demonstrations outside the clinic last year. Immunization Crackdown Despite repeated warnings that pupils would be barred from school unless they document their immunity to six childhood diseases, by last week more than 400 high school students in Norwalk, Conn., had not supplied proof of measles shots, or natural immunity by having had the disease, so school officials began turning them away, as New Haven and Greenwich had done in previous weeks. Most students, however, complied. A bigger exclusion is expected in Hartford on March 2, when 800 children have not met the criteria of a new state law that requires immunization against diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, measles, rubella and polio. Medical and religious exemptions can be sought. Nassau Tax Troubles Only last month, the word from Alphonse M. D'Amato, chairman of the Nassau County Board of Supervisors, was that the county government could do its fiscal duty “by economizing now.” But last week, Mr. D'Amato joined County Executive Francis T. Purcell in backing state legislation that would raise the county's sales tax from 7 percent to 3 percent. The outlook in the Legislature isn't promising. Arthur J. Kremer, who hails from Long Island and is chairman of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, called a stiffer sales tax “the wrong approach.” Late in the week, Governor Carey said he was against the higher tax. too."
"Last Week, the American Bar Association Abandoned a Policy That Had Aged, After 70 Years",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/18/archives/pragmatism-brings-changes-in-the-juvenile-justice-system.html,"WASHINGTON — Seventy years ago, an article in the Harvard Law Review assessed the purpose of the juvenile justice system. The function of the juvenile court, the article said, was to take a delinquent child and “find out what he is, physically, mentally, morally, and then if it learns that he is treading the path that leads to criminality, to take him in charge, not so much to punish as to reform, not to degrade but to uplift, not to crush but to develop, not to make him a criminal but a worthy citizen.” In the intervening years, that hopeful vision has proved to be little more than a fragile illusion, and last week in Atlanta the leaders of the organized bar formally abandoned it. In its place, the American Bar Association ratified a set of standards based on the theory that since the juvenile court cannot remake children in an ideal image, and indeed since it often makes their troubled lives worse for the attempt, it should stop trying. Instead of assuming the role of omniscient parent, the juvenile court should simply be a court. According to the new standards, this means that it should punish young offenders in proportion to the severity of their crimes rather than according to a judge's vague notions of their “best interest.” It also means that the constitutional requirements of due process that apply to other defendants also apply to children — the right to trial by jury, to a lawyer at every stage of the proceedings, to a public trial at which the judge must explain his actions, to appeal. The 17 volumes in which the standards are published cover everything from access to juvenile records to the physical layout of detention facilities. As the raucous debate in the association's House of Delegates demonstrated, the guidelines lend themselves neither to easy consensus nor easy summary. But the overall theme is what Judge Irving R. Kaufman, who headed the commission that spent eight years on the project, calls “the new pragmatism.” Since the juvenile justice system can't work miracles, it should at least be predictable, procedurally regular and fair. The purpose of such ambitious A.B.A. projects is to provide models for courts and state legislatures. Their ratification put the bar's imprimatur on a point of view that has been gaining strength for several years. Disillusionment with the old system is widespread. As juvenile crime has mushroomed — a million children are arrested each year, and children between the ages of 10 and 17, while only 17 percent of the nation's population, account for nearly half the arrests for violent crimes and theft — the topic has become a political issue. Reflecting this trend, the New York legislature last year passed a law giving the adult criminal courts original jurisdiction over children charged with serious violent crimes, beginning at age 13 for accused murderers. It is up to the criminal court judge to transfer the case to Family Court or to hold it for trial on the regular criminal docket. The association's standards take the obverse approach to the same perception that Family Court is not necessarily the best place to try serious crimes. All cases involving children under age 18 would originate in the juvenile court. Beginning at age 15, children charged with serious offenses would be subject to transfer to adult court. So far, there is apparently no disposition in Albany to amend the New York law to conform to this proposal. Although the standards have arrived midway through a revolution, rather than signaling the start of one, their sup porters hope that the guidelines will channel some of the revolutionary fervor into programs that are likely to be constructive as well as politically expedient. “People have to have a place to go to find a conceptual framework,” says Marian Wright Edelman of the Children's Defense Fund. “The standards w ill be very helpful as a reference point.” Some parts of the standards are likely to be either too controversial or too expensive for many states to swallow very soon. For example, a list of the rights of minors provides that a child of any age can give informed consent to an abortion. The standards also provide that no residential correctional facility should house more than 20 juveniles at a time, a requirement that would force many states to close most of the places to which children are sentenced. Several volumes of the standards proved too controversial for the bar association itself. Juvenile court judges were strongly opposed to ending their jurisdiction over children charged with noncriminal misbehavior such as truancy or “incorrigibility,” the category known in many states as P.I.N.S., persons in need of supervision. More than half a million of them pass through the family courts each year, and they are often placed in the same detention facilities as hardened young criminals. The drafters of the standards wanted to remove this group of children from the courts and deal with them through voluntary community service agencies. Judge Kaufman considered this recommendation a cornerstone of the entire project, but faced with the prospect of defeat in the House of Delegates, he withdrew it, along with other controversial proposals. Judge Kaufman says that the withdrawn standards will be reintroduced at a future convention. That is problematic. For one thing, the Joint Commission of the Juvenile Justice Standards Project is out of money, having spent S2.5 million since 1971. For another, the delegates seemed greatly relieved to have finally cleared the subject from their agenda. The turn‐of‐the‐century drafters of the system now being dismantled thought they had found lasting solutions, too, in their therapeutic model of how to return errant youths to the paths of righteousness. The new goals are more modest; the results, scarcely more certain."
How to Dupe the Snoopers,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/18/archives/how-to-dupe-the-snoopers-privacy.html,"IN the first half of this decade two landmark studies— Arthur R. Miller's “Assault on Privacy: Computers, Data Banks, and Dossiers” and the hearings of former Senator Sam J. Ervin Jr.'s Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights ‐warned us, with chilling evidence, that government and private industry were teaming up to strip us of most of our privacy. PRIVACY How to Protect What's Left of It. By Robert Ellis Smith. 346 pp. New York: Anchor Press/Doubleday. $10 As a result of those alarums, and under pressure from outraged citizens, legislators at Federal and state levels passed a few laws that we could use fight back. But as is true with most laws, you've got know they exist and how to apply them before they can do you any good. That's where Robert Ellis Smith's inspiring — as any effective call to arms is inspiring and aptly named “Privacy: Now to Protect What's Left of It” comes in. Robert Ellis Smith is publisher of Privacy Journal, a monthly Washington newsletter that has won quite following and considerable fame among those who care about maintaining a civilized wall around their lives. The expertise and militantly pro‐public bias the journal have also shaped “Privacy,” an absolutely essential book for our time. That is to say, a time when, at worst, citizens are coerced into spying on themselves: We supply the money to support the Government's computer habit: It buys one out of every 22 computers made, operates 10,000 of the machines in all, and, as Mr. Smith says, because “government officials have had to find something to put into all these machines to justify the exorbitant expense,” it has wound up with “an average of eighteen files for each man, woman and child in the United States.” If you think the results of all that frantic compilation aren't sometimes insane, consider the case of Joe Eaton of Miami, who discovered that he was being investigated by the Internal Revenue Service. After some struggle, he forced the Government to release his file so he could see what it had against him. He found that his troubles stemmed from the fact that “a young man on trial for drug violations had Joe Eaton's name on a piece of paper in his wallet. The reason for that was obvious. Mr. Eaton is a Federal judge in Miami, and the youth was one of more than five thousand who had appeared before him. That was the only connection.” The Federal Bureau of Investigation operates a giant data bank called the National Crime Information Center, full of stuff about stolen cars and wanted criminals. It's far from foolproof. The information is sometimes outdated, sometimes false, sometimes misleading. People have been jailed — one was even shot — for “stealing” their own cars. But the Government is a piker when it comes to spreading false information. Private industry is the real expert, and nowhere more than among consumer credit bureaus. When Mr. Smith went to see his own credit‐bureau file, he discovered it had him listed with an account (number and all) at Sears, that he had never had. He asked that this false information be deleted, and the credit bureau obliged — scratching Sears and inserting instead that he had a BankAmericard account, which he did not have. Mr. Smith says he has yet to find anyone who has inspected his or her credit file without finding at least one mistake. A fellow in Cleveland found the credit bureau had him listed as a stock clerk (he is a lawyer) and, though he is a bachelor, listed as married — to his own mother. Eighty percent of consumer investigations for automobile. health and life insurance companies are handled by Equifax Inc. of Atlanta. Its 7,000 investigators file reports on about 22 million citizens a year — and what reports they are! They draw conclusions crucial to your credit from such ridiculous evidence as your zip code and age; if a deeper investigation is called for, Mr. Smith says, the Equifax man may chat with your neighbor for a couple of minutes, or even drop by and look you over for tics (one Equifax report alerted an insurance company that the man applying for a policy used his hands “in effeminate manner”) Watch out for insurance snoops. “Few consumers,” Mr. Smith writes, “realize that when they apply for life insurance they are in fact doing business not with one company but with the whole life insurance industry.” They swap information on their clients through Medical Information Bureau, a computer data bank in Boston. Is this information always accurate? Ask the Mayor of New York, Edward Koch. When he was much younger, he couldn't get an insurance policy. Turned out that a neighbor had told a company investigator that Mr. Koch had cancer. It wasn't true, of course, but insurance companies treat even the looniest neighbors with profound respect. False and distorted data are just part of the problem. The other part is accessibility. You just think your medical records are secret; Mr. Smith explodes that myth. Some states even make it possible for snoops to find out who has had abortions and who is getting psychiatric treatment. Mr. Smith claims that if he can get your Social Security number — no difficult job — he can use that to parlay bank, tax, Social Security, credit, military and college information about you, much of it by just picking up the phone. And if he can do it, so canothers What can you do about it? Not enough, but you aren't entirely helpless. Mr. Smith ends each chapter with a section of cheerful instructions on how to use available Federal laws to make your records more honest and more inaccessible. He also gives some fine advice on how to frustrate the snoops, such as using bank checks printed on dark red paper that makes photo‐reproduction impossible, and filling in some of the impertinent employment‐form blanks with “hieroglyphics like ‘n/a’ (for ‘not available’ or ‘not applicable'), ‘irr.” (for ‘irrelevant'), or ‘wbsue’ (for ‘will be supplied upon employment'). The clerks who process your forms may be reluctant to admit that they do not know what your entries When it comes to holding your coat, Robert Ellis Smith is super."

Family Planning Unit Wins Court Aid Fight,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/24/archives/family-planning-unit-wins-court-aid-fight.html,"ST. PAUL. Minn., Feb. 23 (AP) — A Federal district judge ruled today that Planned Parenthood, a nonprofit corporation that operates an abortion clinic in St. Paul, cannot be denied state money for pre‐pregnancy family planning services. Judge Donald Alsop said the section of a 1978 state law that deliberately excludes Planned Parenthood from eligibility for state money is unconstitutional. The law denies the agency equal protection under the law as guaranteed under the 19th Amendment, the judge ruled. The 1978 Minnesota Legislature set aside $1.3 million to pay for pre-pregnancy family planning services but the law was written to exclude Planned Parenthood from getting any of the money. The agency is Minnesota's ‘largest family planning organization. The legislature gave the money to the Minnesota Health Department, to pass along to cities, counties and nonprofit corporations for “pre‐pregnancy family planning services.”"
BEHIND THE BEST SELLERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/25/archives/behind-the-best-sellers-ann-landers.html,"Ann Landers Dear Ann Landers: I am an ink‐stained wretch working for a family newspaper. I have been reading your 1,200‐page “The Ann Landers Encyclopedia,” and I've got a problem. My problem is: How do I resist writing about you without imitating one of your famous columns? Dear Wretch : Take my advice and write about the book. not me. It's published by Doubleday and it weighs 3¾ pounds. It's not just a collection of old columns but a real Ato‐Z encyclopedia — from Abortion to Zoonoses (diseases humans get from animals). Most of the big subjects in it are written by my friends who are experts —doctors, psychiatrists, sociologists, etc. I've got the last essays written by Hubert Humphrey, on politics as a career, and by Margaret Mead, on grandparents as our greatest unused resource. Dear Arm Landers: I enjoyed the general essays, such as the one on Forgiving, by the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh of Notre Dame, and yours on Love, Marriage, and Divorce. They sounded so — well, so Ann Landers Dear Wretch: Thanks for the left‐handed compliment. You see, I've been doing a column for 23 years — I'm 60 now, with a daughter and three grandchildren. I get a thousand letters a day from all over the world, which are all read by my staff, so I know what's going on. Dear Arm Landers: I get the feeling that you're fairly liberal in your approach you're for abortion on demand and the Equal Rights Amendment. You told me over the phone from your Chicago home — where your friends call you Eppie, the nickname derived from your real name, Esther Pauline Lederer — that these positions have not lost you any readers. I have a question to ask you about life styles today: What's left that you consider naughty? Dear Wretch: thought you'd never ask. I prefer the word indecent to naughty. No. 1, I'm still square enough that I don't approve of living together without marriage. No. 2, I'm against children who ignore their old parents. No. 3, I'm against sleeping with the boss to get ahead on the job. Dear Ann Landers: What if your boss is a woman? Dear Wretch : It's even worse for a man to do it .— that's the pits. Dear Ann Landers: There are days when I find myself sorry because of the silly people I encounter, or have to vote for, and I hear myself complaining a lot. Dear Wretch : Look in my encyclopedia under the letter K. It's got a section on Kissing. Lovers have kissed from the beginning of recorded history. But remember, sometimes kissing can spread disease. Dear Miss Landers: Did you ever read “Miss Lonelyhearts,” that wonderful novel by Nathanael West, about an advice‐to‐the‐lovelorn editor? Dear Wretch: Well, I'm originally from Sioux City, Iowa, and I had never worked on a newspaper before. When I entered a contest and won this job, Larry Fanning, my editor at The Chicago Sun‐Times, gave me the book because he said he didn't want other people's problems to get to me. That fictional character was really wigged out. I take other people's problems seriously but not personally — and so does my book. What I'm trying to say generally is that the world needs a lot more love. ■"
"Slowly, the Vatican Is Moving From the Palaces to the Pueblos",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/25/archives/religion-education-energy-slowly-the-vatican-is-moving-from-the.html,"When Pope John Paul II last week denounced “exploitation of man by man” as well as “by the state and economic systems,” he was asserting a view of the Roman Catholic church's proper relationship to the temporal realm that is at variance with much of the theory and practice of ages of Christian history. After centuries of trying to link the church with, political regimes, the Vatican is turning toward a policy of disentanglement and a style of activism that focuses on moral issues rather than the formation of partisan organizations. Papal statements, documents of the Second Vatican. Council and theologians from many regions have called on the church to side with the poor, contribute to political awareness and criticise ideologies left and right. Concurrently, the church has redefined its place in a variety of political situations, either by being forced to take on a new role or by applying evolving patterns of social and theological analysis to an increasingly complex patchwork of political systems. Evidence of the desire to step back from direct political involvement or special political status can be found in many parts of the Catholic world. The church has largely broker. its established ties to the regimes in Spain and Ireland, for example. and learned a lesson from its embarrassment when the Portuguese regime, closely allied with the church. collapsed in Angola and Mozambique. Pope John XXIII and his successor Paul VI warned the dangers of communism at the same time that they condemned what they saw as the excesses of private enterprise. In his encyclical, “Populorum Progressio,“or example, Paul VI attacked the “system” that “considers profit as the key motive for economic progress, competition as the supreme law of economics and private ownership of the means of production as an absolute right that has no limits and carries no corresponding social obligations.” The Vatican Council provided intellectual foundations for rethinking the church's role in society. The “Declaration on Religious Liberty'’ said the church should forswear special privileges and ask only for freedom to practice religion. And the “Constitution on the Church and the World” stated that the church “has no specific political mission” but that its “religious mission” includes “enhancing the dignity the human person,” “protecting human rights,” and “fostering unity of the human family.” While the model of “nonpolitical” activism has been shaped over the past decade, John Paul II has focused attention on the specific cases of the church's conduct both in the context of Latin America's staggering social problems and the hostile setting of the Communist nations. “ The Pope's principal speech at the Latin American conference of bishops and the final document by the bishops themselves reflect the new position. Together, they urge the church to take up the cause of the poor and to press the fight for “liberation” from a host of injustices. But they explicitly caution against entwining the church in political parties. In his speech, the Pope drew on the teachings of his predecessors, particularly Paul VI, to lay down a theological basis for the ministry of liberation that will, it is widely believed, be the core of his first encyclical, expected soon. He declared that the church must above all insist on its special spiritual claims., The church “cannot cease to affirm the church's faith,” he said. Only by seeing himself as a child God, he continued, can man comprehend the meaning human dignity and truly see the need to defend it. The Pope's rationale rejects any definition of people as basically economic components, or aggregates of social and cultural influences, as Christianity's competing ideologies declare. But his call for supreme allegiance to Christ as the one absolute claim, beyond any ideology, entails an insistence that God's compassion for the poor implies action. While Chris'. was not primarily a “revolutionary,” the Pope said. he nonetheless “did not remain indifferent in the face of this vast and demanding imperative of social morality.” The dawning of the Kingdom of God, proclaimed within the Gospels as beginning with Christ, states that those who carry out this imperative will be specially blessed. The difficulties with the new style of activism have become apparent as the church strives to incorporate advocacy of human rights within the larger category evangelizat on. The actual process of working out the principle can cause confusion. Political interest on behalf of the downtrodden may be hard to separate from outright political organization. One example is the church's drive against abortion. While the campaign rests on religious beliefs about the sanctity of human life, the strategies used often resemble those of partisan politics. The church argues that it does not exceed its right to lobby on an issue of such importance, but critics have difficulty seeing the line between such efforts and direct political partisanship. But despite complications, ‘the church seems determined to ask a minimum of favors from governments order to take a stand as disinterested party in a wide assortment of issues. The Pope has shown a desire to be beholden to no regime and the freedom to criticize any and all. He did so in his naive Poland and can be expected to do so again if, as expected. he visits that country again this spring. The implementation of this attitude varies from region to region, and the general call for protection of human rights leaves much to the ingenuity of local clergy and laity. But pointing out those beliefs that lie at the heart of the faith, and by pleading for an application of those beliefs, the Pope has developed the art of nonaligned churchmanship a step further."
"In Spain, the ‘Don't Knows’ May Decide The Elections",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/25/archives/in-spain-the-dont-knows-may-decide-the-elections.html,"MADRID — In the last 26 months, Spaniards have been thrice called to the polls to express their views on the nation's impressive transformation from dictatorship to democracy. On Thursday, the 26.8 million voters will again be summoned to vote for a new Parliament, but politicians are worried that their nonstop politicking since Francisco Franco's death in November 1975 has bored the population. It has been a listless, rain‐soaked winter campaign, its terrain and timing deftly chosen by Prime Minister Adolfo Suarez, leaving the Socialists and Communists unable to stage the big outdoor fiesta‐like rallies that lent color and fervor to parliamentary elections in June 1977. Opinion polls show Mr. Suarez's Union of the Democratic Center running even with the Spanish Socialist Workers Party led by Felipe Gonzalez, a 36‐year‐old former labor lawyer from Seville. But, barring a surprise, neither of Spain's two big parties expects to garner the 38 to 40 percent of the popular vote needed for a majority in the 350‐member lower house. The Socialists, like the other parties, have been vague about what they would do if they came to power. Having learned the lesson of the defeat of the French left a year ago, they did nothing that might frighten off voters. Mr. Suárez stresses fighting inflation; the Socialists focus on unemployment, which affects more than a million Spaniards. Mr. Suárez's party, which has taken on the cast of a traditional European conservative grouping, tepidly approves a restrictive divorce law and opposes legal abortion; the Socialists endorse divorce by mutual consent, steering clear of the abortion issue to avoid angering Roman Catholics. The parties do differ sharply over the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Mr. Suarez favors Spain's entry, while the Socialists (and Communists) oppose it. But this difference is somewhat hypothetical, since only a Government with a solid parliamentary majority could move Spain into NATO. Mr. Gonzálеz has skilfully led his 100‐year‐old party out of the shadows of Francoism and into the daylight of democratic politics, gently prodding its sometimes radical base of militants into accepting a type of social democracy divested of the kind of ambitious nationalization plans and Marxist rhetoric that has handicapped other Latin Socialist parties. But he has acknowledged the party's greatest difficulty to be the resistance of Marxist‐minded cadres to accepting the need for moderation if the Socialists come to power. “ft does not take a great effort of imagination,” he wrote, “to understand that the greatest danger that a Socialist government could face — probably harassed by the economic right and all reactionary sectors of the country —would be the lack of understanding and in some cases the hostility of the party's own militant base and the U.G.T. [the Socialists’ union].” Mr. Gonzalez has also learned from the disastrous Socialist‐Communist alliance in France. Hе has studiously ignored the blandishments and attacks of Santiago Carrillo's small but well‐organized Communist Party, which has clamored for a coalition with the two leading parties. But the Communists are dominant in Spain's infant labor movement, so the two leftist parties have been quietly conferring about possible collaboration in the important municipal elections on April 3. The left accuses Mr. Suárez of calling the parliamentary election first so he can use Government appointees in the city halls to get out the vote. They would have preferred to have the municipal elections first, to use as a springboard to victory on the national level. Mг. Suarez has launched an eleventh‐hour blitz to turn out the voters, but one poll disclosed a pronounced disinclination to vote. The similar, homogenized tone of the big parties, all seeking to win a “center” vote they perceive as decisive, has turned off many Spaniards. “All power to the don't‐knows!” has been a campaign joke, alluding to many who decline to tell pollsters how, or if, they will vote. The moderation of all parties is the result of Basque terrorist attacks and a latent fear that rightists in the Spanish military, who dabbled in amateurish plotting last November, might do something rash. Sweeping arrests of perhaps 100 alleged terrorist sympathizers in the Basque provinces in the past few weeks, and last‐minute French cooperation in rounding up known members of the E.T.A., the Basque guerrilla group, in southern France, appear to have dislocated some of the gunmen's cells and information networks. Spanish officials are relieved that “only” 27 persons have been assassinated in 1979, but the nation is nervously poised for E.T.A. action as Thursday approaches. Mr. Suarez's Union of the Democratic Center feels that, if it can match its June 1977 performance, it will continue as a minority government, maneuvering between right and left in the Cortes to pickup majorities on different issues. But if it falls below 160 seats — or if the second‐place Socialists move into first place — some kind of coalition government seems inevitable. Its shape would be affected by the showing of the new rightist Democratic Coalition, a spruced‐up version of Manuel Fraga Iribarne's right‐wing Popular Alliance. Mr. Suarez would prefer a coalition with the Socialists to one with the right, but few can envisage him taking a secondary role in a government headed by Mr. González. The Socialists may secretly be edgy about what they would do if they actually headed Spain's Government. In the latest issue of El Socialists, Alfonso Guerra, the party's number two man, noted sharply, “To me those who are in a hurry to govern are just as shameful as those who are afraid of governing. Whoever is in politics is there to change the social, political and economic situation. And that you can only do by governing, with power. I believe that the P.S.O.E. [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] cannot be either in a hurry, or afraid. If the people say that we have to govern, we have no other choice but to govern.”"
Moscow Abuzz Over the Perils Of War in Asia,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/26/archives/moscow-abuzz-over-the-perils-of-war-in-asia-peaceful-scene-in.html,"MOSCOW, Feb. 25 — One morning last week, after the Chinese had invaded Vietnam, a Russian woman walked into a sauna reserved for Moscow's elite and said, “Well, girls, will there be war or not?” The steamy room erupted into an excited chatter of worried voices. Moscow is gripped by news from Vietnam as it has not been held by any outside event in many years. But the mood is hard to define, adrift among confused currents of righteous outrage and corrosive fear, confidence and concern, and nonchalance. A grandmother, learning that her daughter is pregnant for the second time, is urging abortion because, she reasons, if there is a war, it will be no time to bring a child into the world. A 9‐year‐old insists on staying up past her bedtime to watch television news reports of the fighting in Asia, even though there has been no film, just words, angry words. Peaceful Scene in Moscow Snow On Friday morning, in bright winter sunlight, a young couple left their baby it a carriage alongside a little hill on the outskirts of the capital, then took turn: sledding down through a stand of austere white birches, falling into the powder filling the woods with carefree laughter. The fear is kept at bay, even though nothing stirs Russian emotions like the specter of war. The suffering of World War II is still a fresh experience, maintained in classrooms and movie houses and living rooms as testimony to heroism, a vehicle of patriotism. Recently, when a group of Soviet teenagers were asked by an American reporter what was wrong in the world that they wanted to set right, their answers were dominated by the risk of war. Dictatorship, they said, and deprivation of rights in places such as Chile and Rhodesia. The needless weapons being manufactured while people go hungry. Unemployment. Racial discrimination. Crime in the United States. The growth of fascism in the West. The risk of war. “If it breaks out, it will annihilate all of humanity,” a girl said.. The Soviet people know that Vietnam is their friend and China is their enemy, and it is logical for them to think that if their enemy attacks their friend, then there is a chance of a Chinese‐Soviet clash. And in this culture now, the images of China are laden with the most sinister, frightening stereotypes. On television and in movie theaters, a documentary on China presented in recent weeks showed military officers in fanatical chants and soldiers in superhuman feats, breaking bricks with their fists and scaling tall buildings without ropes. Black Humor Is Circulating The fear of China finds release in political jokes, a kind of therapy through black humor. One line is a news bulletin in the year 2000: “All is quiet on the FinnishChinese border.” Another joke has Leonid 1. Brezhnev telephoning President Carter to tell him about a dream in which the Soviet leader saw the White House and the Capitol draped in red flags and banners and slogans. Mr. Carter replies that he, too, had a dream, in which he saw the Kremlin festooned with red flags, banners and slogans. “Well, there's nothing unusual in that,” says Mr. Brezhnev. ‘'What did the slogans say?” “I don't know,” Mr. Carter replies. “I can't read Chinese.”"
Wider Use Is Urged For Rh Vaccine,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/27/archives/wider-use-is-urged-for-rh-vaccine-nearly-all-receive-vaccine.html,"Avaccine that was a research triumph in the 1960's is fulfilling much of its promise in reducing brain damage and infant mortality, but a Connecticut campaign to insure that it is used wherever necessary suggests that many more babies could be saved if other states began such drives. The vaccine is unique in mat it is given to one person, a newly delivered mother, to protect a second person, the next baby she conceives. The target ill- ness is Rh hemolytic disease, which also is called erythroblastosis fetalis. It strikes babies before birth, and its damage can last a lifetime. This illness results from an immuno- logic incompatibility between the mother, whose red blood cells lack an antigen called the Rh factor, and her fetus's red cells, which have it. When small amounts of fetal Rh positive blood leak into the mother's circulation during pregnancy or labor, her baby begins to produce an anti‐Rh antibody that in later pregnancies will cross the placenta and destroy the fetus's red cells, killing it if the disease is severe. The Rh vaccine, which came into clinical use in this country 11 years ago, is made of the very stuff that in- jures the fetus. Researchers in New York City and in Liverpool, England, realized in the early 1960's that inject- ing an Rh‐negative mother with a small amount of this substance at the time she delivered an Rh‐positive baby, could trick her system so that she would not become actively sensitized to the Rh factor. This keeps her body from attacking the next Rh‐positive fetus that she carries in her womb. Clinical studies of the vaccine at the Columbia‐Presbyterian Medical Center in New York, undertaken by its developers, Dr. John Gorman, a pathologist, and Dr. Vincent Freda, an obstetrician, showed that it is about 98 percent effective in preventing maternal Rh sensitization and perinatal illness and death in subsequent children. The vaccine must be injected into new mothers within three days after they deliver their babies. The injection should also be given to Rh‐negative women after abortions, diagnostic amniocentesis and after they receive transfusions of mismatched Rh-positive blood. The vaccine is reported to be safe and is said never to have caused a serious side effect or reaction. As its use widened in the early 1970's, Dr. Gorman calculated that it could cut the Rh disease toll to about 260 deaths a year. Data issued recently by the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta indicate that the goal is being approached. There were 233 Rh deaths in 1976, the last year for which, figures are available. However, that total includes only liveborn babies, not those who .died of Rh disease late in gestation. There were 941 of these neonatal Rh deaths in 1968, the year the vaccine was licensed. So the death toll is down by more than 75 percent. What worries the center's analysts, however, is that the morbidity rate for Rh disease, which dropped from 40 cases per 10,000 births at the start of this decade to 18 cases in 1975, has since leveled off, a sign that the disease is holding its own against further efforts to limit its toll. The rate was 16 cases per 10,000 births in 1977, the last year for which there are definitive figures, and Melissa Adams, an epidemiologist, says preliminary 1978 figures show no change. The Rh vaccine is given to women by their doctors on the basis of tests when they deliver their babies, or by the clinics or other facilities where they receive abortions. However, estimates based on sales of Rh vaccine suggest that 20 percent of those who are eligible do not receive it. The principal gap in efforts to control Rh disease thus is no longer a research problem but one of organizing and delivering health care. Eight years ago, the Connecticut Department of Health initiated an effort to administer the vaccine to all new mothers who were medically eligible. A research analyst, Jo Ann Gustafson, was hired to run a state Rh Registry and to make sure that personnel in Connecticut's 34 maternity hospitals found the women with risk. There is no comparable service in New York State. Nearly All Receive Vaccine The Connecticut results have impressed Rh experts. In 1977, 99.6 percent of eligible women were given the vaccine. Only 12 eligible women in the state failed to get it, and several of them were planning to be sterilized and thus faced little further tisk. In 1977, only three babies died of Rh disease in Connecticut. The state's fail‐safe system demonstrates that the vaccine — which has saved the lives of an estimated 200,000 infants around the world — could save even more if other states set up comparable surveillance. But, said Melissa Adams of the Atlanta center, only Nebraska has done so. The states have become complacent, she said, because officials have seen the Rh disease toll drop without the expenditure of public health money. So Rh now has low priority, even though projections show that each brain-damaged Rh baby who must be institutionalized can cost society hundreds of thousands of dollars."
Foes of Abortion Seek to Tighten Restrictions on Medicaid Funds,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/01/archives/foes-of-abortion-seek-to-tighten-restrictions-on-medicaid-funds-do.html,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 — Groups opposing abortion hope that this year the controversial Hyde amendment, which they have used to chip away at the use of Federal funds for abortions, will provide the leverage to impose an even more restrictive ban on Government support of abortions. The amendment, sponsored each year since 1976 by Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois, prohibits the use of Medicaid funds to pay for abortions except in cases in which the woman's life would be endangered if the fetus were carried full‐term. However, compromises have succeeded in adding other exceptions to the ban. This year those who oppose abortion are hoping to make those exceptions even more restrictive in language. They will also go a step further by proposing constitutional amendments to nullify the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion and to protect fetal life “at every stage of biological development.” The language of one amendment changes that of the original Hyde proposal to permit abortion “only to prevent the death of the mother” rather than to save her life. ‘Do Battle Every Year’ “We have to do battle every year,” Mr. Hyde said in an interview. “I think the situation will be much the same as last year. But increasingly this issue is being thought about and studied, and I'm optimistic.” He said there would be a restrictive amendment on the appropriation bill for the Health, Education and Welfare Department. His amendment was first attached to the appropriation bills for the H.E.W. and Labor Departments in 1976, but it did not get anywhere that year. The next year it was killed in a House‐Senate conference committee. Last year, in compromise between the Senate and House after acrimonious debate, antiabortion groups were able to use it to get a curb on Medicaid‐financed abortions for low‐income women. Exceptions were made for women’ whose lives would be endangered by pregnancy resulting from rape or incest if the offense was promptly reported, or when “severe and long‐lasting” physical damage to the health of the woman was determined by two physicians. Limiting the Exceptions Buoyed by the success of the Medicaid curb and two other appropriation riders that eliminated federally financed abortions for Peace Corps volunteers and military personnel and their dependents, the anti‐abortion groups expect the Hyde amendment to restrict further the use of Federal funds by limiting each type of exception to the ban. For instance, much debate is expected over what constitutes “prompt” reporting of cases of rape or incest. Sixty days was the time period finally decided on last year, but Congressmen who oppose Federal funds for abortions are likely to argue that that period should be reduced substantially. Arguments are also expected over how to determine what constitutes severe or long‐lasting health damage to a pregnant woman. Amendments to bills must be reconsidered at each session in which a new appropriations measure comes up. But the organized opponents to abortion believe that this year may provide a better climate for their annual struggle. They note the departure from the Senate of two leading supporters of Medicaid‐financed abortions, Senators Edward W. Brooke, Republican of Massachusetts, and Dick Clark, Democrat of Iowa, as helpful to their cause. “I think the pro‐life support in both the House and the Senate has been strengthened,” Mr. Hyde said. “We'll be in a better position than in the last two years because we have more votes.” At the same time, he acknowledged that those opposed to a constitutional amendment to outlaw abortion had considerable strength. “The pro‐choice people are formidable,” he said. “They're much better funded than the little old pro‐life groups.” That is why he is not content to rely only on his amendment as a force for change, he said. Mr. Hyde is one of several sponsors of the proposed constitutional amendments to protect fetal life. Groups opposing abortiorf are also pressing for a constitutional convention to put pressure on Congress to pass such amendments."
"DEWEY F. BARTLETT,",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/03/archives/dewey-f-bartlett-exsenator-is-dead-oklahoma-republican-59-served.html,"Former United States Senator Dewey F. Bartlett of Oklahoma, who retired in January after a single term, died of lung cancer Thursday night at his home in Tulsa. He was 59 years old and had recently undergone further treatment for the disease, which was diagnosed two years ago. Until his declining health forced him to abandon plans for a re‐election campaign last year, Mr. Bartlett, a Republican, appeared to have a promising career in the Senate, where he had become a leading champion of conservative causes. Unusually outspoken for a freshman Senator, Mr. Bartlett, who had previously served as Governor of Oklahoma, used a seat on the Armed Services Committee as his primary platform. Sought Military Strength He advocated a strong military posture, and in 1976, after a two‐week inspection of North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces,a statement issued by Mr. Bartlett and Senator Sam Nurm of Georgia calling for “a quantum jump” in NATO firepower became the centerpiece of a continuing policy debate. An oil millionaire, Mr. Bartlett, who later acquired farming and ranching interests, followed the tradition of Senators from Oklahoma in championing the interests of oil producers in the debate touched off by the energy squeeze. In addition, he sought to prevent the use of public funds for abortions and tried to keep lawyers in the Federal legal aid program from participating in cases involving busing or other school integration measures. Dewey Follett Bartlett was born in Marietta, Ohio, on March 28, 1919. He graduated from the Lawrenceville School in New Jersey and Princeton University, where he obtained a degree in geological engineering. After serving as a Marine Corps divebomber pilot in the Pacific in World War II, Mr. Bartlett moved to Oklahoma, where he joined his father and brother in oil exploration. Entering politics as a Tulsa precinct captain in the 1952 Presidential campaign of Dwight D. Eisenhower, Mr. Bartlett did not make his first race until 1962, when he was elected state senator. He left the Senate to run for Governor in 1966, winning by a landslide. During his term he acquired a nationwide reputation , for his aggressive campaign to lure industry to Oklahoma, but nicer a re‐election campaign as the state's “job‐getting‘ est Governor” in 1970, he lost to David Hall by less than 3,000 votes in the closest race in the state's history.

High Sounds and Silences,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/04/archives/high-sounds-and-silences-webern.html,"THE printed scores of Anton von Webern's compositions could be pictures of the views from the Alpine mountain peaks he loved. Empty spaces of silence are punctuated here and there by isolated notes passed among the staves. Vocal lines are jagged, rocky, encompassing octaves in a single measure. There is little contact with the ground. The scores seem images of the kind of music Webern thought a “Beethoven of our day” would write, “music that a man writes in solitude, far away from all turmoil of the world, in contemplation of the glaciers, of eternal ice and snow, of the sombre mountain giants.” Unfortunately, when the scores have been heard, most listeners have been left far below, without bearings, surrounded by seeming chaos. Twenty‐four years have passed since Webern was mistakenly shot by a nervous American soldier in a small town outside Vienna just after World War II; nearly a century has passed since his birth in 1883. And though his music has inspired a generation of both avant‐garde composers and academic analysts, that music and his name have been rarely heard and more rarely loved by those of us below professional heights. Indeed, many of the compositions would never be heard were It not for the pioneering recordings “The Complete Webern,” made under the direction of Robert Craft. But even today most listeners react as critics did over 50 years ago: they spoke of “sound phantoms,” “desolate eccentricity” and “bloodless brain music.” The dynamics are often pianississimo; “scarcely audible” is one marking. Webern's longest composition lasts less than a quarter of an hour; the shortest is over in seconds. His entire life work (aside “from. the manuscripts recently discovered by Hails .Moldenhauer) lasts about three hours. These are strange mountains indeed for an admirer of Alpine heights. Until Hans Moldenhauer began his research 20 years ago, the history of the man was almost as enigmatic as his music. Even the tales of his death were filled with hearsay and innuendo. Until Mr. Moldenhauer interviewed witnesses, examined documents and published, in 1961, “The Death of Anton Webern.” Since then he has been working on the life. Amalie Waller, Webern's daughter to whose memory the biography is dedicated, provided him with a wealth of nianusciipts, letters and diaries that became part of the “Moldenhauer Archives,” an extensive historical collection of original musical documents and sources. The Webern manuscripts included newly discovered works that were performed at the First International Webern Festival in Seattle in 1962. Mr. Moldenhauer continued with his excavations, uncover ing art objects, sketchbooks, personal possessions and the remnants of Webern's library in a dark attic just outside Vienna. Out of that mass of new and valuable material (a preliminary catalogue ran to 50 pages) emerged this documentary biography. Because of a severe visual impairment, Hans Moldenhauer has been aided throughout by his wife, Rosaleen. The result is an important and impressive achievement, clearly presenting the details of Webern's life, including much new information, long extracts from diaries and unpublished letters, as well as “work histories” of the compositions that provide insight into their generation. There are few additional facts a layman could want to know; the scholar, too, is presented with a comprehensive guide. This information is essential for an understanding of the man whose music has been the central influence on much of the music written since World War II. But the importance of the book makes its weaknesses disturbing. The authors speak, for example, of a “critical” episode in Webern's life, dealing with “concerns of a nature so intimate” that it required “enforced secrecy”; “something drastic” was attempted. Eventually one realizes that the euphemisms refer to an unwanted pregnancy and the attempted abortion of Webern's first child, born six weeks after his marriage. There is also a disconcerting historical error in the text. The authors assert that the Nazis’ Kristallnacht of 1938 was so called “because of the wanton destruction of much precious crystal”; actually, of course, it was so called because of the shattering of the less pre cious and more common glass of Jewish storefronts and homes. The main difficulty with the book, though, is that as the first full‐scale scholarly biography it concentrates on documentation and stops short of interpreting the life or considering the important esthetic questions raised by the music; it often provides facts without the necessary historical perspective. The‐result is that the overwhelming amount of detail ccnceals the subject's importance. One gets to know Webern well, but his life appears dull and uneventful and seems to shed little light upon the mysteries of the music. Webern rarely left Vienika and its environs. He earned a Ph.D. with a dissertation on the music of Heinrich Isaac, a 15thcentury polyphonist. Through a newspaper advertisement he met Arnold Schoenberg, nine years his senior, and with Alban Berg became his pupil and lifelong disciple. Webern's music was neglected and ridiculed. He had problems earning a living as an operatic director, but later gained a reputation as a superb conductor, particularly of Mahler's works. He was a “family man.” He was disturbingly sympathetic toward the Nazis. But in fact, this ordinary life is dominated by themes that still resonate within contemporary society. For example, Webern was never financially secure, and could earn almost nothing from his compositions; it was necessary for him to work in the theater conducting opera. Unable to compose, he would become dismally unhappy, or even sick, and leave his job, only to search again for employment. This “sickness” nearly incapacitated him, and in 1913, he en tered psychoanalysis, unfortunately choosing Adler over Freud. His antipathy to the theater was extreme. In his early 20's he complained about audiences: “How I hate them, these Philistines. ... [They are] lazy, immovable, full of dullness.” Later the distaste became physical; he found the population “repugnant” and spoke of the “scum of men.” Real music could only be made in different surroundings, away from the “filth” of the theater. Webern often fled to the mountains, to compose in their shadow. He wrote to Berg: “From time to time I must breathe this air, this rarefied air of the heights. ... All this must mean something. I have to seek these regions periodically.” He would also flee to Schoenberg, to musical heights. His devotion was total; speaking for his fellow admirers, he wrote to Schoenberg in 1911: “The disciples of Jesus Christ could not have felt more deeply for the Lord than we for you.” Again and again in the excerpts the Moldenhauers have culled from the several thousand pages of letters Webern wrote to his mentor, passages of worship appear: “You are set up in my heart as my highest ideal whom I love more and more, to whom I am more and more devoted.” The geography of Webern's universe is vertical: below is the realm of commerce and filth, above is religion and music; below is the city, above are the mountains. In those mountains his music took form. He collected mountain flowers and cultivated a Nature mysticism that guided his choice of his music's vocal texts (which the Moldenhauers should have reprinted). He spoke of Goethe's “primeval plant”: “everything is the same: root, stalk, blossom”; all is a “variation of the Edward sotro Anton von Webern. same idea,” an image of “natural law.” Webern's compositions are meant to be corresponding structures; they are meticulously constructed, with intricate relations and complex play. “No trace of arbitrariness!” Webem exclaimed in a lecture, “Nothing illusory!” The laws of music, particularly Schoenberg's “laws” of 12‐tone composition, were extensions of the laws of Nature, revealed on mountainous heights. These views may help us understand some of Webern's bewildering opinions during the Nazi epoch. The Moldenhauers discuss this “vexing question,” but only to describe it as “tragic self‐delusion.” At first, Webem's alliances seemed clear. Schoenberg left Austria in 1933 and converted back to Judaism; many of Webern's other friends also went into exile. Their music — and Webern's — was banned. He lost his position as conductor of the Democratic Socialist orchestra and chorus when the group was dissolved. In 1934 he reassured Schoenberg that he had “no feeling whatever” for the concept of race, and he recognized his responsibility in remaining behind: “Will the question not be posed: ‘And where were you in these times?’ I have the feeling that it becomes more and more deci Yet with one revered authority in exile, it is almost as if Webern had to turn to another. In 1936 he innocently remarked: “One should attempt to convince the Hitler regime of the rightness of the twelve‐tone system.” Later, one daughter joined the Nazi youth group and married a storm trooper; Webern's son became an avowed Nazi. And though Webern never joined the party, and never compromised on musical issues, and regularly aided his Jewish friends, by 1940 he was writing to Josef Hueber of the “enlightenment” provided by “Mein Kampf.” The Third Reich, he wrote, “is something new! Created by this unique man!!!” After Pearl Harbor, he called the Japanese a “completely healthy race!” Nazism undoubtedly appealed to Webern's pride in his elevated noble heritage (we know of his genealogy back to 1574 primarily sponse. to the Nazis’ Nu, remberg Laws). But also he reportedly believed that “for dear order's sake, any kind of authority should be respected.” Nazism provided an authority, promised a destiny, recognized his elevation above the herd, and offered its own Nature mysticism; it echoed his musical ideology. Webern's submission to a musical authority and his devotion to “law” were also responses to some of the difficulties European music faced after the dissolution of tonal “common practice” at the beginning of the century. The danger was that music's spirit would be stifled by a regulatory system. When the search for order was connected, as in Webern's life, with an aversion to theater and the ignoble world beneath the mountain peaks, the additional danger was that music would be private, esoteric, “professional.” These dangers have been realized in much of the music written since Webern died and can be seen in the isolation of contemporary composers and their music. But I think Oat, despite the difficulty. of Webern's music, he may have actually overcome some of these tendencies. Webern, while demanding regulation, consistently seemed to transcend it: the Nazi sympathizer seemed in his daily life to be loyal to his friends and his music; the devoted disciple of Schoenberg developed his own distinctive musical voice; and his compositions, which revel in law, sound free. But how, then, are we to listen to Webern's music? Doesn't its esoteric “order” often defy the human ear, leaving us not with freedom but with chaos? Webern provided at least a partial answer. He insisted that the inner law expressed itself in the experience of the work, even to an untutored ear, just as we comprehend the unity of a Beethoven sonata without analyzing the motivic or harmonic structure. And perhaps we do indeed hear in Webern's music what he intended us to hear; we must shift our expectations (something that has been far easier in the visual arts). After a mountain excursion Webern wrote: “I have stroggled all my life to reproduce in music what I perceive there.” Many of the preliminary sketches for his works, discussed by the Moldenhauers, contain clear references to mountain locations (and to his parents’ gravesites; but that is another tale). Webern speaks of isolation, of fragrance, of contemplation. And all of this can be heard. His works are not theatrical dramatic pieces; they presume no social context; there is little sense of development or of the historical narrative that tonality could explore. These compositions are abstract, standing apart from time and reference; each presents an extremely concise image, almost a fragrance born on a breeze. The works are landscapes, frozen moments in abstract space. Even Webern's transcription of the Bach Ricercar from “The Musical Offering” seems to take place in a transformed region as the theme is split and passed among different instruments. When the motifs are Webern's own, we may be thoroughly suspended in a world of exotic beauty and wit; his final choral works are haunting. “Sometime in the future,” Webern asserted, “even the postman will whistle my melodies!” I think not Weberm's music, like all music, finds its intended audience; it is directed to those above the “earthly strivings” of the everyday. It hints at the composer's dislocation from the social world, and at the esoteric professionalism that has now come into its own. It is ironic, then, that the study of the life behind such abstract music is so revealing. The Moldenhauers’ biography of Webern may be of great value to the scholarly community, but it will be of greater value if it allows the rest of us to begin to understand Webern's imaginative world. It may indeed be possible for us to enter briefly into his landscape — not to dwell there, but to breathe the air we have inherited. Perhaps also, in this age of musical change and exploration, we might hope that his recent successors will meet us on their way down from the heights."
Study Drive at Chicago School Has a Hazy Identity,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/05/archives/study-drive-at-chicago-school-has-a-hazy-identity-jesse-jacksons.html,"CHICAGO — Although he was a part of it, Gregory Lewis was not exactly sure what the “Push for Excellence” program was. Its name was too similar to “Access to Excellence,” the Board of Education's desegregation plan. “Access to Excellence comes during high school and Push for Excellence comes when you go to college, I think,” the Orr High School sophomore said. The Rev. Roosevelt James, a member of the school's parent advisory committee, was similarly confused. “As far as Push for Excellence is concerned, I think it is a good program but I don't really understand what it is,” he said. Of the dozens of parents, students and businessmen in the community around Orr High School who were interviewed, almost all said they endorsed the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Push for Excellence program to improve student performance. Few, however, could say just what was involved in the program, which is being used in more than a dozen cities around the country and which has made Mr. Jackson a force in American education. The Department of Health, Education and Welfare has given $425,000 to support Mr. Jackson's efforts, and is seeking $3 million moreover the next three years. It has been about two years since Mr. Jackson came to Orr High, preached the virtues of his program and won enthusiastic support from students and teachers. Most of the students he addressed during his visit have graduated, and indications are that support for the program waning because its identity has become hazy. Of more than a dozen students interviewed, none could define the program except in terms of some special activity they were involved in. Most of their activities turned out to be part of the Access to Excellence program. As Push‐Excel officials explain it, Mr. Jackson's program seeks to upgrade the academic performance of underachieving students by stressing the importance of education and motivating students to work toward its rewards. Students, teachers, parents, ministers and community business leaders pledge to share the responsibility for encouraging better educational performance. Students are asked to sign pledges to study more. Parents are asked to sign “moral obligation contracts” promising to turn off television sets in their homes for two hours a night and make sure their children study during that period. The contracts also commit parents to visiting their children's schools at least four times a year to confer with teachers and pick up report cards. Businessmen pledge to offer summer jobs. Orr High School has an enrollment of 2,500 students from a tough and predominantly poor community. It has a history Hof poor academic performance, high truancy, classroom violence and a high student pregnancy rate — the type of school at which the Push‐Excel program ‘ is designed to make a difference. Kenneth van Spankeren, the principal at Orr, said: “Many facets of the Excel program were already in place here when we volunteered to participate in it. But the program brought more attention to them because of the charisma of Jesse Jackson.” “Its main goals are a change in attitude and this is not tangible and doesn't occur overnight,” Mr. Van Spankeren said. “But since we have used some of the elements we have seen a reduction in the problems that have plagued the school —truancy, assaults, false fire alarms, vandalism and students milling about the halls instead of going to classes.” Orr has been using the Push‐Excel program for two years, and is cited by Mr. Jackson as a success. However, neither parents nor students have been asked to sign the pledges, and many parents say they have not been asked to do anything they were not already doing to improve their children's academic performance. “They have asked parents to visit the schools and pick up report cards, but this is not working as well as I would like to see it work,” said Annie Montgomery, who has two children at Orr. “They also ask us to talk to parents from other schools and go to the schools sometimes to make sure the kids go to class. I have been doing that for 20 years.” “I was not asked to work out a study program for my child or to turn off the TV,” said Gladys Pirtle, whose son is a sophomore at Orr. “But they didn't have to tell me to do it because I have long felt if you show interest in your children it will make them want to do the right thing.” A group of community businessmen, under an “adopt‐a‐school” program, has agreed to support efforts to improve the school by providing summer jobs for winners in a program called the Academic Olympics. The Olympics, an annual competition in academic skills between students at nine schools, was in effect before the Push‐Excel program came to Orr, and only three of 10 schools participating in the program also participate in the competition. However, Mr. Jackson got the businessmen to provide the jobs. “We felt that if you have high unemployment in an area you will probably have high crime,” said Robert D. Jaffee, president of the AMCO Corporation, who persuaded other members of a group called the Young Presidents Association to provide 56 summer jobs in support of the Push‐Excel program. Other schools among the 10 in Chicago that have participated in the Push‐Excel program have had difficulties with it. The principal of Chicago Vocational School, a former director of the Chicago Push‐Excel program, said that it had outlived its usefulness at his school and would probably be phased out. Gerald Gallagher, principal of Schurz High School, the only predominantly white school participating in the program. said, “In some ways the program is out of place in our school.” He said that the school had not participated in a recent Push‐Excel program on abortion and motherhood because there is a low incidence of pregnancy at Schurz, and that many Schurz students do not participate in other Push‐Excel activities because they take place on the other side of the city. The Chicago Push‐Excel effort has also had administrative problems. There have been three directors in the program's two‐year existence. The last director to leave. Dr. Carl Boyd, said he wanted to return to a business career, but others close to the program said he left because he did not have the freedom of action he wanted. A frequent criticism of the Push‐Excel program, especially in the black community, is that it “blames the victims” of bad school systems by addressing itself to poor student performance rather than educational reform. That criticism is accepted in part by Dr. Manford Byrd. deputy superintendent of Chicago schools and the school board's halson with Push‐Excel, who said, “Parents and students must do something for themselves, but I never want to give the impression that youngsters and parents or teachers bear total responsibility for lack of student achievement or mot iviabon.” Mr. Jackson has answered critics on this point by saying. “I challenge the victimizer everywhere I go. White I know that the victimizer may be responsible for the victim being down, the victim must be responsible for getting up.”"
The Editorial Notebook,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/06/archives/the-editorial-notebook-the-religious-case-for-abortion-rights.html,"There has at last been an interesting intellectual departure in the heated debate over abortion policy. Under current law, the Federal Medicaid pro‐. gram pays all valid medical expenses for poor women. but does not pay for abortions, except in the cage of rape, incest, or serious health threat to the mother. A case in the Brooklyn court of Federal District Judge John Dooling, McRae v. Califano, attacks the law on various grounds, but it is its claim of First Amendment rights that raises provocative questions about the law's religious neutrality. The case is a class action brought on behalf of all Medicaid‐eligible women by several civil liberties and church groups. They argue that the current Medicaid statute puts into law the religious dogma of those who view the fetus as a human being from the moment an egg is fertilized. To the Roman Catholic Church, for example, all abortion is murder. Orthodox Jews and some Protestant sects condone abortion only when the mother's life is threatened. The plaintiffs contend that current law strongly reflects such views and, therefore, denies some poor women the right to exercise their belief. This proposition is viewed by some as an attack on political advocacy by religions in general, and by the Catholic Church in particular. The Catholic journal, Commonweal, recently asked angrily “Do Catholics Have Constitutional Rights?” The plaintiffs do not, however, claim that the Catholic Church — or any other religious group — must remain mute on public issues. Nor do they suggest that poor women have an inalienable right to Medicaid for abortions. But they do make three important arguments: • They say that some women do, in fact, have a religious reason for seeking an abortion. Some non‐Orthodox Jews, for example, believe that abortion may be required to preserve a woman's physical or mental health. Various Protestant denominations teach that responsible parenthood may sometimes require ending a pregnancy. Many Baptist groups believe that the abortion decision should be a matter of personal conscience. • The suit asserts that the law is unfair. If the Government were to end Medicaid benefits for all pregnant women — whether they have babies or abortions — it would be religiously neutral and not an abuse of anyone's First Amendment rights. But to deny poor women funds for an abortion is a denial of religious freedom. • The plaintiffs suggest that for Government to overlook such religious claims, it must have a secular purpose. But the current law does not. It saves no money. It is not part of some national population policy. It does not protect women's health. If anything, it drives them to unqualified abortionists. Repeated Congressional debate leaves little doubt that the current law is intended to protect the fetus as if it were a human being from the day of conception and as if abortion, in most cases, is murder. This view of the nature of life is a matter of faith or religion, not universally shared by the public, nor, indeed, by the Supreme Court. It deserves to be challenged in court. Some describe this challenge as divisive and as a threat to harmony in our pluralistic society. On the contrary; that threat is posed not by the case but by the law it would undo."
A Politician in the Family Mold,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/06/archives/a-politician-in-the-family-mold-praise-from-former-congressman.html,"WASHINGTON, March 5 — “You know, it's you your father wants to run for President, not Jerry,” said Frederick Dutton, a Californian who was an aide to President Kennedy and is now a lawyer here. He was talking to a willowy young woman whose dark hair was caught back with a pair of eyeglasses perched high on her head. “Oh, Dad just likes to keep that sibling rivalry going at full tilt,” she replied with a grin. It was a Georgetown fund‐raising party for 33‐year‐old Kathleen Brown Rice, who is running for re‐election to the Los Angeles School Board. She is the daughter of former California Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown, and the younger sister of Edmund G. Brown Jr., who is the present Governor of California and who just may be running for President. Mrs. Rice was in Washington ostensibly to participate in an annual meeting of the Council of Great City Schools — “You never hear anyone calling it the Council of Deteriorating Inner‐City Schools,” she noted — and some old friends had rallied around to help raise money for her campaign back in California. One guest, Mandell Ourisman, the owner of a local car dealership and a Republican, discovered to his dismay that he was in a nest of Democrats and was a bit bewildered by the whole affair. “You mean to say she's running for the school board in Los Angeles — what the heck is she doing in Washington?” he asked his companion. “How can you be so naive?” was the retort. Tom Rees, a former Democratic’ Congressman from West Los Angeles, said. “Kathy's neat. Even if her name was not Brown, she would have made it on her own.” It has been reported that, as a child, Mrs. Rice had resented the demands of political life. But there was no hint of political ennui as she sat, dressed in a casual sweater and skirt, tiny diamond studs in her pierced ears, and talked about her political race. “I can chart the touchstones of my life by my father's elections to political office,” she said, “first as district attorney, then as attorney general and governor. I obviously felt it an experience worth repeating, because I am in the family business. I am in politics.” Elected to Board In 1975 Married at 19 to George Rice, a Los Angeles lawyer, Mrs. Rice is a graduate of Stanford University and the mother of three children: Hillary, 13: Sasha, 9, and Zeb, 7. She was elected to the Los Angeles School Board, which administers an annual budget of $1.5 billion, in 1975. She is campaigning for re‐election against eight opponents in a nonpartisan primary April 3. The problems of busing and the fallout from Proposition 13 are the key campaign issues, she said. “We have school programs for children from the age of 2 to adult education programs in which 98‐year‐old people are enrolled, and they are all threatened with loss of funding as a result of Proposition 13,” she said. “I have suggested we tax business and industry at a different level as one solution. They are receiving the major windfall from Proposition 13.” The benefits of being known as the sister of the Governor are mixed, she said. “By and large I have carved out my own space and personality and image, just as Jerry has done in following in the footsteps of our father.” Because of her brother's support of Proposition 13 after it was passed, Mrs. Rice said, she at first did not receive the support of the Los Angeles teachers’ union in her race for reelection. “They are angry,” she said. “They are part of that angry mood in the country. They feel they are the whipping boys of Proposition 13.” The union has reversed itself, however, and she now has their endorsement. This angry mood, she said, has produced “a kind of intolerance for the politics of negotiation.” “You are either a pro•buser or an antibuser,” she continued, “people can't deal with the middle ground. The same thing is true with the issue of abortion. It is an ugly phase we are going through. I don't see people feeling good about large issues, larger than themselves.” Of Governor Brown's proposed constitutional convention to compel a balanced Federal budget, she said: “As a political ideal, it might be terrific. But I see the need for a Marshall Plan for the cities. If we see Cleveland and other cities die and wither away, balanced budgets won't mean anything.” Her immediate concern, she said, is with the schools. “Public education deals with what I consider to be the major problems of society,” she said. “And when the public schools are abandoned to one economic group, they become a wasteland, and the rich and upper class find themselves in the bailiwicks of cultural isolation — the private schools.” She talked about the quality of urban life and today's ever‐changing interest groups and fluid constituencies. “In my father's day you could count on one constituency and coalition for longer than a week or a month — they held together for generations,” she said. Of her brother, Mrs. Rice said, she is absolutely certain about two things: Contrary to his reputation, he is not a flake, and he does have a sense of humor. His Sense of Humor “He has a wry sense of humor,” she said. “I think people say he is humorless because he is not a backslapping, old‐boy jokester type.” She said, “I think his sense of the political mood is far more astute than mine. My own sense is that there is a vacuum of leadership and people are looking for someone who brings clarity of vision, who will bring will and courage.” As for her own political aspirations, she said, “I'm just working hard, trying to get reelected to the school board.”"
High Court Voids Alimony Laws Requiring Only Husbands to Pay,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/06/archives/high-court-voids-alimony-laws-requiring-only-husbands-to-pay-end-to.html,"WASHINGTON, March 5 — The Supreme Court ruled, 6 to 3, today that state laws providing that husbands but not wives may be required to pay alimony are unconstitutional. The decision held that such laws violate the equal‐protection clause of the Constitution. The ruling strikes down an Alabama law that had been held constitutional by Alabama courts. It would also appear to invalidate laws in 10 other states, including New York. Writing for the majority, Associate Justice William J. Brennan Jr. rejected the reasoning of the Alabama courts that the law was necessary to protect women and compensate for their lesser ability to earn a living after a divorce. “The old notion that generally it is the man's primary responsibility to provide a home and its essentials can no longer justify a statute that discriminates on the basis of gender,” Justice Brennan wrote. He said that the protection of the needier spouse in any given divorce was a legitimate state objective but one that could be achieved by an alimony law that is “gender‐neutral.” The majority opinion concluded, “Whereas here the state's compensatory and ameliorative purposes are as well served by a gender‐neutral classification as one that gender‐classifies and therefore carries with it the baggage of sexual stereotypes, the state cannot be permitted to classify on the basis of sex.” The reaction to the decision was as swift as it was varied. “It's bad for women,” said Phyllis Schlafly, a leading opponent of the equal rights amendment to the Constitution. “It's a real boost for our bill,” said Lester Wellman, chairman of a New York State Bar Association committee that advocates a law providing for alimony for both men and women. [Page B7.] The Alabama law was challenged by a former husband, William Orr, who fell more than $5,000 behind on his alimony payments. In appealing a lower‐court judgment against him, he did not contend that he was entitled to alimony from his former wife, but rather that because no wife could ever be ordered to pay, he as man was subject to a discriminatory oblibation. Whether Mr. On has to continue paying alimony in light of today's decision is now a matter for the Alabama courts, to whom the justices returned the case, On v. Orr, No. 77‐1119. Justice Brennan indicated that the question of Mr. On's personal obligation might well be settled by state contract law. Although the decision did not deal with the question of retroactivity, Supreme Court decisions are generally not retroactive, and today's ruling will probably not affect alimony agreements already in force. For the future, the court said, the states affected have two options — either provide that alimony obligations are to be determined without regard to sex, or remove alimony entirely from the scope of a divorce court's function. It was the procedural nature of Mr. Orr's contention, rather than the merits of his constitutional challenge, that led to the three dissents today. Associate Justices Lewis F. Powell Jr. and William H. Rehnquist, along with Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, argued that the Supreme Court should not have decided the case because there was no indication that Mr. On would be relieved of his own alimony obligation even if the state law fell on constitutional grounds. The majority's long discussion of Mr. On's standing to bring the case is likely to be of as much interest to students of the Court as is the ruling itself. Associate Justices Potter Stewart, Byron R. White, Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun, and John Paul Stevens joined in the majority opinion. In addition to Alabama and New York the decision is likely to affect the laws in Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee and Wyoming. Other Supreme Court action today included the following: By 5 to 4, the Justices declined to extend a five‐year‐old decision that the Constitution gives a poor person charged with a minor offense the right to a courtappointed lawyer if conviction is likely to bring a jail sentence. The question in today's case, Scott v. Illinois, No. 77‐1177, was whether the right to counsel exists in every case where jail is a possibility, regardless of its likelihood. The majority opinion, by Justice Rehnquist, said that the earlier case, Argesinger v. Hamlin, had gone far enough and that “any extension would create confusion and impose unpredictable, but necessarily substantial, costs on 50 quite diverse states.” The dissent, by Justice Brennan, rejected that pragmatic analysis, pointing out that in the wake of Argesinger and its famous predecessor, Gideon v. Wainwright, some 33 states already provided counsel in virtually all cases where prison was an authorized sentence. The dissent labeled as “alarmist prophecies” the majority's fear of adding a new burden to state court systems. Justices Burger, Stewart, White and Powell joined the majority. Justices Marshall and Stevens joined Justice Brennan's dissent, with Justice Blackmun filing a separate dissent. In a two‐paragraph, unsigned opinion, the Justices revived the possibility that a South Carolina physician may be prosecuted for murder under a state law that prohibits abortions performed in the third trimester of pregnancy. The baby in this case. Anders v. Floyd, No. 77‐1255, was born alive and died after 20 days. A Federal district court declared the law unconstitutional and enjoined the state from prosecuting Dr. Jesse J. Floyd. Today's order, with only Justice Stewart dissenting, told the court to reconsider its action in the light of both an earlier abortion decision and the general policy against Federal court interference with state court prosecutions. In a second abortion case, the Justices affirthed without opinion a Federal appeals court decision that a portion of Missouri's anti‐abortion law is unconstitutional. The law required a doctor to inform a patient facing an abortion that if the fetus was born alive it would be taken away from her as a ward of the state. Justices White and Rehnquist dissented in favor of hearing full arguments in the case, Ashcroft v. Freiman No. 78‐1102. The Court refused to review a Federal appeals court deciSion that reporters have no right to advance notice when government agencies subpoena their longdistance records from the telephone company. The case, Reporters Committee v. A.T.&T., No. 78‐774, arose from attempts by Federal agencies in the last years of the Nixon Administration to get information about reporters’ sources by scrutinizing their telephone records. Justices Brennan, Stewart and Marshall wanted to hear the case, but four votes are needed to grant review. For the second time, the Justices refused to hear a constitutional challenge to New York State's narcotics law, which provides for life sentences for the sale of minute amounts of drugs This case, Gonzalez v. N.Y., No. 78‐5833, was an appeal by a man sentenced to six years to. life for the sale of 0.14 ounces of cocaine to an undercover agent. Justices Brennan and Marshall voted to hear the case. Last October, the Court agreed to decide a New York case that raised the question of how far a trial judge can go in persuading a criminal defendant to plead guilty rather than insist on a trial. But after hearing argument on the case, the Justices decided that this question was not actually presented by the facts of the case, and today they announced that they would let the lower court opinion stand without further review. That action, which has no value as a precedent, leaves standing the conviction of a Brooklyn man who pleaded guilty to two robberies and later contended that the judge had coerced him. (Ramsey v. N.Y., No. 776540.) Two weeks after they upheld the law requiring Foreign Service officers to retire at the age of 60 the Justices made clear that they had thought enough about mandatory retirement this term. They denied review in three cases on the subject, two from New York. In one of these, Palmer v. Ticcione, No. 240, a Long Island kindergarten teacher, was appealing her unsuccessful constitutional challenge to the mandatory retirement feature of the state education law. In the other, Johnson v. Lefkowitz, No. 77‐1444, a state lawyer, covered by civil service, was appealing his unsuccessful challenge to a similar feature of the state's retirement and Social Security law. The Court took the advice of the Justice Department and declined to get involved in a Pennsylvania governmental dispute. Over the veto of former Gov. Milton Shapp, the Pennsylvania Legislature had passed a law giving itself the power to disburse all Federal funds that come into the state treasury — about one‐quarter of the state's total income. The State Su preme Court upheld the law. Pennsylvania's executive branch sought United States Supreme Court review on the ground that the law allows the state legislature to frustrate the will of Congress in enacting the various aid programs. Several other state legislatures are considering similar laws. (Thornburgh v. Casey, No. 78‐642)."
"Funding of Abortions By Medicaid Declines, Califano Tells Panel",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/08/archives/funding-of-abortions-by-medicaid-declines-califano-tells-panel.html,"WASHINGTON, March 7 (AP) — The number of abortions financed under the Medicaid program dropped sharply last year as tighter restrictions on payments were put into force, the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, Joseph A. Califano Jr. said today. Mr. Califano told the House appropriations subcommittee that handles his agency's budget that from Feb. 12 to Dec. 31, 1978, the Government paid for 2,421 abortions through Medicaid. The Public Health Service, an agency under H.E.W.'s jurisdiction, estimated that the Government paid for 250,000 to 300,000 abortions a year from 1972, when first‐trimester abortions were made legal, to 1976, when Congress began tightening the criteria for abortion funds. Mr. Califano described the figures reported today as preliminary, the products of a new department policy requiring states to keep records of the number of abortions or sterilization for which Medicaid reimbursement is sought. News reports have cited similar but less comprehensive figures demonstrating the decline in Medicaid‐financed abortions. Mr. Califano said that last year, 1,857 of the abortions paid for under the Medicaid program occurred in instances in which a woman's life was jeopardized by a pregnancy; 385 were for cases in which doctors certified that a woman would suffer severe and long‐lasting physical health damage unless she had an abortion and 61 were performed in cases of rape or incest that had been promptly reported to the authorities. In addition, Alaska reported 94 abortions and Massachusetts reported 24 abortions for which reasons were not specified. The Alan Gutmacher Institute, affiliated with the Planned Parenthood Federation, makes its own estimates of the number of abortions performed in the United States. A spokeswoman, Ellen Sullivan, said the institute estimated that the Government paid for 274,400 Medicaid abortions in the fiscal year 1976 and 294,600 abortions in the fiscal year 1977. About 1.2 million abortions were performed nationwide in 1975 and 1.3 million in 1977, the institute estimated. Mr. Centeno presented the figures at a hearing on H.E.W.'s proposed budget for the fiscal year 1980."
Spain's Middle Class Seems to Find Rallying Point in Suárez's Party,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/08/archives/spains-middle-class-seems-to-find-rallying-point-in-suarezs-party.html,"MADRID, March 7 — A longtime tragedy of Spanish politics has been the incapacity of the right to organize itself and govern the nation without igniting a sharp, sometimes violent reaction from a volatile left. The antagonism between fight and left during the tumultuous Second Republic led in 1936 to civil war, a chapter of Spanish history that to this day conditions political behavior here. Post‐mortems on last week's Parliament elections have understandably focused on the personal triumph of Prime Minister Adolfo Suárez and the failure of the second‐ranking Socialists to improve their position significantly. But another, long‐term result of Spain's second free election since the death of Francisco Franco in November 1975 may be the consolidation of an important part of the Spanish middle class in a single party, Mr. Suárez's Union of the Democratic Center. The Choice of the King Since being chosen by his friend King Juan Carlos in the summer of 1976 to govern the country, the Prime Minister has been consistently reproached for leaning too far to the left, alienating his natural constituency of big and small businessmen, bankers and, at times, even the Roman Catholic Church establishment. Mr. Suarez's perceived leftism — his warm embraces with President. Fidel Castro of Cuba in Havana, for example —has usually been more symbolic than real, and sometimes has said more about the rightward trend of things in postFranco Spain than his Government's actions. But it has been a conscious strategy, with no small contribution from the King himself, intended to avoid any opening of the rift between the two Spains in this highly class‐conscious society. The Union of the Democratic Center calls itself an interclass party “inspired by Christian humanism,” one of the Prime Minister's preferred phrases. Something of a self‐made man himself, and an outsider to Spain's moneyed Establishment, Mr. Suarez has nonetheless finally linked up with important financial centers, which this time backed his campaign. Few of the party's leaders, moreover, come from humble backgrounds. The combination of Mr. Suárez's liberal statements and essentially conservative stands on divorce, abortion and economic issues turned out to be a deadly one for those on his right who believed that he had gone too far to the left and lost the trust of the large number of Spaniards who became middle‐class during the economic boom of the 1960's. For this election, the right‐wing Popular Alliance of Manuel Fraga Iribarne, a one‐time Franco minister, shed its more nostalgic Francoists and presented itself as the Democratic Coalition. “If you feel you're center‐right, vote Democratic Coalition,” was its main campaign slogan. But with polls suggesting the possibility of a strong Socialist advance, thousands of Spaniards who felt center‐right also felt the Prime Minister embodied those sentiments and deserted Mr. Fraga's party. The Popular Alliance had drawn 8.3 percent of the popular vote in June 1977; this time it won only 5.5 percent, tumbling from 16 to 9 seats in the lower house. Another segment of its following abandoned it for the neo‐Fascist National Union, which won only 2 percent of the vote and one seat. To consolidate Spain's new party of the middle and lower‐middle classes, Mr. Suarez's strategists now must duplicate their performance of last week in the April 3 municipal elections. The Socialists and the Communists expect to do well in big cities like Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia and Seville, but the Government party might match them in smaller cities like Zaragoza, Valladolid and Santander, not to speak of small towns and villages where it has already fielded more candidates than has the left. Moreover, Mr. Suarez, through a clever alliance with Josep Taradellas, the patriarch of Catalan regionalism and president of Catalonia's fledgling local government, has established an important political beachhead in the heavily industrialized northeastern region. Catalan nationalists led by Jordi Pujol, a wealthy industrialist, may even provide Mr. Suárez with the nine seats he needs for an absolute majority in the lower house. Popular Front Is Unlikely Meanwhile, the Socialists, who aimed their campaign at many of the middleclass voters who ultimately cast their ballots Mr Mr. Suárez, will have to rethink their strategy during the next four years, the mandate of the new Parliament. “The working classes have taught the Socialists a lesson,” said Santiago Carrillo, whose small Communist Party marginally improved its position with 23 seats and 10 percent of the popular vote. But what lesson? Neither Mr. Carrillo nor Felipe González, the 36‐year‐old Socialist leader, seems ready to join a 1930's‐style popular front, even though the combined popular votes of their two parties surpass Mr. Suárez's coalition by 40.1 to 35.2. Both leftist leaders know that a Communist‐Socialist alliance would frighten many Spaniards, including the military, and the Socialists seem to believe that they can do better by avoiding alliances for the moment."
Artificial Insemination of Single Women Poses Difficult Questions,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/09/archives/artificial-insemination-of-single-women-poses-difficult-questions.html,"She worked in a beauty shop in a small New Jersey town. He taught elementary school. Both were young and single and, although they had talked of marrying some day, she did not want to wait to have a child. Nor was she willing to have sexual relations with him before marriage. Accordingly, he agreed to donate the sperm necessary for artificial insemination. As a result, they became the principal figures in an unusual legal case on artificial insemination among the unmarried, a subject that is arousing increasing legal, medical and ethical concern. The New Jersey couple consulted a doctor who refused to inseminate an unmarried woman, but referred them to a sperm bank. At the sperm bank, she learned the techniques used in artificial insemination. They then attempted .the procedure on their own. On the third attempt, conception occurred and early in the pregnancy the relationship ended. The child, a boy, was born in a New Jersey hospital in 1975. This story came to public attention nearly two years ago when the Cumberland County Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court said the father had a right to visit the child as well as a responsibility to support him. In granting visitation and custodial rights, Judge Frank Testa held that no distinction should be made between a child conceived naturally and a child conceived artificially. “A case of first impression, he called it, “presenting a unique factual situation with no reported legal precedents.” While the case may have been unique in law, the New Jersey beautician was not the only single woman to become a mother under such circumstances. Infertility specialists in New York and other large cities report a small but growing number of unmarried patients seeking A.I.D., the medical shorthand for artifical insemination by donor. Artificial insemination, performed in this country a century ago, was long regarded as controversial both inside and outside of the medical community. Only in the last decade has the procedure gained wide acceptance as a therapy for married couples who are childless because of a defect in the husband's sperm. This is due in part to the shortage of adoptable babies and in part to new laws in New York and several other states giving the offspring of artificially inseminated married women the same rights as natural or adoptive children, providing the woman's husband signs the necessary forms before treatment begins. Today artificial insemination by donor results in 10,000 to 20,000 births a year. Precise figures are hard to come by because of care taken to protect, all parties involved — the anonymous donor, the married couple and the child. As the American Medical Association's legal handbook asserts, “the utmost medical secrecy is essential to all aspects of the procedure.” The handbook does not deal with the issue of use of the procedure by unmarried patients, which in the minds of doctors and lawyers alike is an increasingly grave issue. “Five years ago, an unmarried patient requesting insemination was unheard of,” said Dr. Jaroslav Marik, director of the Tyler Medical Clinic in Los Angeles. “Now we do have some coming in. We have no policy of refusing or accepting them. It depends on the situation. We don't like it muchhut we do treat a few.” As many as 25 inseminations a day are performed at the Tyler clinic, the vast majority on the wives of infertile men. There, as elsewhere, unmarried applicants tend to fall in three broad categories: The Career Woman. She is in her 30's, professionally successful, financially secure.. Her child‐bearing yeai‐S are running out with no marital prospect in sight. Rather than become pregnant by a casual acquaintance, she prefers an anonymous donor whose sound genetic background has been verified by the clinic. The Disturbed Woman. She is younger; she may have been traumatized by rape or abortion. “My boyfriend made me have an abortion,” a bitter young woman said. “I want a baby of my own.” Still, her plans for rearing and supporting the child are vague. After hearing the fee for artificial insemination by donor ($75 to $100 an insemination), she often abandons the idea. The Lesbian. She may try to hide her sexual preference, or she may be quite outspoken, demanding her “biological right to motherhood.” (A Philadelphia doctor, who refused to treat a lesbian on the advice of a hospital attorney, said she had threatened to bring suit through the American Civil Liberties Union.) A.I.D. appeals to the homosexual woman for several masons — for one, there is no known father to challenge her fitness in a custody battle. Of the three categories of women, she is the most likely to be living with a lover and to argue that she can give a child a “stable home” with two parent figures. Some infertility specialists are not moved by such arguments. Nor are they swayed by the fact that certain states, New York among them, now permit adoptions by single parents. To impregnate an unmarried woman artificially, the specialists contend, is to risk a lawsuit. As Dr. Sherwin Kaufman, director of the Lenox Hill Hospital Infertility Clinic in Manhattan and a specialist in the field for more than 30 years, put it: “Everyone is so conscious of the child who is brought forth in less than optimum circumstances suing not only the doctor but his own parents. I can envision a situation where a child says, ‘I have no father. My mother and her doctor conspired that I be conceived in this manner.’ “ Acknowledging that his view “may be a narrow one,” and that his mind “may change some day,” Dr. Kaufman said his policy against dealing with unmarried parients was based not only on personal judgment but also on advice from child psychologists, who say a child is better off with two parents. “I have talked to colleagues who don't differentiate between married and unmarried women,” he added. “They say, ‘Obviously, children are born out of wedlock all the time and their mothers do keep them.’ But that is not the same as a doctor getting them pregnant.” When a doctor refuses, a woman may look elsewhere — to so‐called alternative health centers or to homosexual organizations. “We've had gay men call and offer to be donors, “ said Linda Gryczan of the Lesbian Mother's Defense Fund in Seattle. “When the father is gay, he may act as a co‐parent. The child may live sometimes with the man and sometimes with the woman and another parry not biologically involved.” Miss Gryczan said that artificial insemina tion was not something a lesbian would under take casually: “The women who used it in this community make long‐range plans about finances, school, who they want to raise children with. It would be nice if all children had the benefit of that much forethought before they were conceived.” Born Into a Legal Limbo Still, the artificially conceived child of an unmarried woman is born into a legal limbo unless, as in the New Jersey case, the sperm donor asserts paternity. In an essay on that case, George P. Smith 2d, a professor of law at Catholic University, says that in Judge Testa's decision, “the best interests of a child and the best interests of society” were served. In the current issue of the University of Louisville's Journal of Family Law, Professor Smith writes, in part: “Although the initial so cial, ethical, and religious repugnancy of the procedure cannot be ignored, the immediate welfare of a guiltless child and the economic costs imposed upon society in raising that child must be considered paramount and controlling. Finding legitimacy in cases of this nature is the only equitable solution.” The involvement of a doctor is crucial to any case of this kind, in the view of Leonard Loeb, chairman of the American Bar Association's family law section. “If a woman inseminates herself it becomes like a marriage without a clergyman or a judge,” he said. “You must have someone authorized to give it sanctity.,I know of no state that sanctifies A.I.D. to an unmarried woman. It may be coming but I think you'd have a hell of a time getting that one past any legislature.” The artifically conceived child of an unmarried woman is, born into a legal limbo."
"Nurse, Opposing Abortions, Sues On Hospital Job",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/10/archives/nurse-opposing-abortions-sues-on-hospital-job-settlement-is-sought.html,"HACKENSACK, N.J., March 9 — A constitutional case over abortions is developing in State Superior Court here between a 30‐year‐old registered nurse who opposes them and a hospital that transferred her from its maternity wing a week after she told superiors that she could no longer participate in ending pregnancies. The nurse, Beverly Jeczalik of Hawthorne, N.J. contends in a lawsuit that the reassignment amounts to unconstitutional religious discrimination against her anti‐abortion beliefs as a member of the Christian Reform Church. “I feel that abortion is murder of the unborn,” Mrs. Jeczalik, a mother of two young daughters, said after a court hearing today. “I was hired for maternity, not to perform abortions.” Her employer, the Valley Hospital of Ridgewood, denied that the change to other nursing duties violated her civil or constitutional rights, and argued in court papers that it must have administrative discretion to assign its nursing personnel to insure that all patients receive proper care. “The hospital action constitutes a reasonable accommodation among conflicting interests,” the hospital said in a statement today. “Her transfer ... insures that she will not be required to perform any act that violates her beliefs.” Judge Sherwin D. Lester, who last month denied the nurse's appeal for immediate reinstatement to the maternity ward, met privately in his chambers today with lawyers for both sides. He instructed them to spend the next two weeks trying to arrange an out‐of‐court settlement to the dispute. Mrs. Jeczalik joined Valley's nursing staff in March 1975 and worked evenings every other weekend in the emergency room until she took a maternity leave early last year to await the birth of her second child. When she returned to work last November, she asked for part‐time duty in the maternity ward. The request was granted. On Jan. 6, Mrs. Jeczalik helped to deliver a stillborn fetus from a patient in her second trimester of pregnancy who had been injected with an abortion‐inducing saline solution, according to the nurse's lawyer, Robert A. Baron of Englewood. He said the experience was an “emotional” one for his client. Three days later, Mrs. Jeczalik wrote to her superior that she could no longer participate in abortions. On Jan. 15, she was switched from the maternity ward to the medical‐surgical nursing staff with the explanation that she had had insufficient experience for maternity duty, according to her suit. Mrs. Jeczalik's pay and work schedule were not affected by the transfer. Even though no pay was lost, the nurse argues that the transfer itself was a “discriminatory and disciplinary act” in violation of a 1974 New Jersey law that prohibits such steps against medical personnel who refuse to perform or to participate in abortions."

Posthumous Stories,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/11/archives/posthumous-stories.html,"THE WOMAN WHO WAS CHANGED And Other Stories. By Pearl S. Buck. A John Day Book. 192 pp. New York: Thomas Y. Crowell. $8.95. Pearl S. Buck, who died six years ago at the age of 80, wrote more than 85 books — novels, collections of short stories, children's books and essays. One of the most widely translated American writers, she is best known as the author of “The Good Earth,” a novel about peasant life in China that was written almost 50 years ago and is probably her best work. Pearl Buck was the only American womab to win the Nobel Prize for Literature, which she received in 1938. At the time of her death there were said to be 25 unpublished volumes; the current collection, consisting of the title novella and five short stories, is part of the continuing publication of her work. Although none of the stories in “The Woman Who Was Changed” is set in China, Pearl Buck's name is inexorably linked with that country. To read her today, in the context of the recent rapprochement between China and the United States, the two countries she called home, is to resurrect a large segment of history. Pearl Buck is part of that history, because she was there during the years of transition from imperial dynasty to modern state and because, through her writing, she brought China into the homes of millions of Americans. The daughter of Presbyterian missionaries, Miss Buck spent almost all of the first 40 years of her life in China, not in isolated missionary compounds but among the people of Chinkiang and Nanjing. Educated in both Eastern and Western cultures (Chinese was her first language), she was in a unique position to understand both, yet felt rooted in neither. She valued and wanted to preserve the China she grew up in, which made her persona non grata with both the Nationalists and the Communists. When she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1931, there were protests here that although she was an American citizen she was not an American writer, that her concerns and her life were exclusively Chinese. She left China for good in 1934, but did not find in America the free country her idealistic parents had promised. Instead, she confronted racial prejudice and injustice, and spent a great deal of time (and money) for the rest of her life fighting it, some say to the detriment of her writing. The literary community in this country has never taken Pearl Buck seriously, and indeed she is more fascinating as a person than as a writer. Both she and her publisher‐husband Richard Walsh felt she was slighted because she wrote so much, so successfully. In reaction, during the 1940's and 50's she wrote five novels about American life under the pseudonym “John Sedges,” ostensibly to prove she could write about subjects other than China, but probably also to protect the marketability of her work. Not that this was necessary: Pearl Buck has always been an extremely popular, best‐selling author and her following to this day is enormous. In America, much of her work was serialized in “ladies’ “ magazines, an outlet Miss Buck defended because she wanted to reach millions of women who didn't read books. Miss Buck's reasoning may have been populist, but in fact her writing was perfectly suited for a mass readership. Pearl Buck's work has an almost universal appeal because of her subject matter dramatic life situations of birth, death and marriage — and a writing style close to that of moral fable. Her characters are easily identifiable types — virtuous or evil, charming or repugnant. She writes, at her best, with the easy grace of a natural storyteller, free of any trace of modernism. At other times, as in the present volume, her work becomes didactic and sentimental, stopping just short of soap opera. The story “John‐John Chinaman” is representative of Miss Buck's writing in this book. The hero is John Lim, a Chinese American who is passed over as valedictorian of his high school graduating class because of his race. Embittered and angry at America and Americans, John does not go on to college but instead joins his father in the family laundry, washing and ironing shirts for the town notables. When chosen by lot as the first draftee from his town to go to war, John is suddenly converted to grateful, flag‐waving patriotism. Written in 1942, at the height of American chauvinism, the story seems dated not just because of our altered consciousness about nationalism and war, but because today John would win a scholarship to M.I.T. or Harvard and the mayor of his town would wear permanent‐press shirts. Most of the other stories in this volume are equally slight, and one wonders why they were not published until after the author's death. Any of them could have appeared in Redbook or Ladies Home Journal in the 1940's or 50's; although only two dates of publication are given, it is clear they were all written during that period. They revolve around issues that were controversial — marrying for security, illegal abortion, nuclear research, racial prejudice — but that Pearl Buck, an independent, outspoken person, wrote and spoke about freely. The explanation may lie in the previously unpublished title novella, “The Woman Who Was Changed,” which has strong autobiographical resonances. Miss Buck was quite reticent about her personal life; even her admiring biographer, T. F. Harris, laments this. But the situation presented in “The Woman Who Was Changed” is remarkably close to the author's own. It is about a writer, Eleanor (Nora) Dane, who leaves her husband because he cannot deal with her growing success and public fame. Nora has changed; she wants to spend her time writing, he wants her to remain a traditional wife. The story is an evocative, convincing portrayal of a determined woman who chooses solitude, freedom and creativity over romance. Ultimately Nora is persuaded to marry again, this time to a man who promises a relationship of equality and respect. Nora's decision to remarry is presented with cloying sentimentality: “Love binds with no bands,” the new husband says in the last line. This soppy concession to marital bliss mars an otherwise strong story, and one can only speculate why the author felt compelled to tack on this particular ending. Like Nora, Pearl Buck married twice; the first time in China, to an American agricultural missionary, John Buck, who took little interest in her work. It was an unsatisfactory marriage (she had a half‐Chinese lover) but she stuck it out for 18 years. In 1935, at the height of her literary success, she divorced Buck and married her editor and publisher. Richard Walsh, who had fostered her career and pursued her for years. Apparently this marriage, too, had its problems. In the biography, Miss Buck says that the Nobel Prize “was quite a test of my husband ... it must have taken considerable grace for him to be there in ... a sort of secondary position.” The reader is intrigued by the personal conflicts this famous, successful woman must have experienced. If we cannot find them in her reminiscences, perhaps they will gradually be revealed as her unpublished work comes into print. Pearl Buck had no hesitancy in mining her own experience for her writing, but claimed she would never publish anything that would hurt anyone. Now that most of the parties are dead, we may get a closer look at the life of this extraordinary woman."
Budget Convention Drive Appears to Be Faltering,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/11/archives/budget-convention-drive-appears-to-be-faltering-system-never-used.html,"WASHINGTON, March 10 — The national movement for a constitutional convention to consider a mandatory balanced Federal budget appears likely to fall short of its goal. Under the Constitution, Congress must convene such an assembly if two‐thirds of the state legislatures, or 34, request it by adopting petitions. Twenty‐eight states have taken this step and two more are expected to do so shortly. But a survey by The New York Times of the 20 remaining states indicates that there are only two more in which there is a reasonable prospect that the legislatures will take such action this year—New Hampshire and Rhode Island—and the outcome in both is by no means certain. A shift in sentiment in states including Illinois and Missouri, where the constitutional convention currently appears unlikely to receive endorsement, could change this picture, but present circumstances indicate that the prospect of a convention has been reduced if not eliminated. System Never Used The constitutional machinery for a convention has never been used. As a result, Congress has never drafted any laws to specify how delegates to a convention would be apportioned and chosen or how the session would operate, and there are no legal precedents of any kind in the area. If advocates of a convention fail to muster enough states to call one, it will be welcome news to some groups, including the following: գ Public officials of both parties who fear that a convention could not be limited to a specified agenda and might run away to adopt proposed amendments on issues like abortion, gun control and equal rights for women. գFiscal experts, both conservative and liberal, who believe that a mandatory balanced Federal budget would be mechanically unworkable and drastically limit the Government's ability to cope with recessions, as well as failing to curb public spending. գ Leaders and members of Congress, who have been apprehensive that a convention would deprive them of a major source of legislative authority. Any amendment approved by a convention and ratified by three‐quarters of the states would severely curtail Congressional activity in whatever area it dealt with. Disappointment to Others On the other hand, failure to create a convention would be a serious disappointment to economy‐minded citizens and groups who have become convinced that a balanced Federal budget will curb inflation and that Congress and the President will never produce one without a constitutional mandate. The National Taxpayers Union, which has been coordinating the campaign for a constitutional convention, maintains that the project remains very much alive. David Keating of the organization said that petitions had a chance of adoption in 20 states that had not yet approved the move. A survey by Times correspondents of legislative leaders in state capitals indicated, however, that the numbers now favor opponents of a convention. Favorable action is expected in two more states. Montana is expected to approve a petition for a convention soon. Resolutions have passed both houses of the Indiana Legislature and minor differences are being resolved in conference. Actions in the States California defeated the convention call last month, and one house of the West Virginia Legislature killed a similar move this week, ending its prospects there. In addition, prospects for approval are regarded as minimal in Alaska, Maine, Michigan, New Jersey and New York. States in which action is seen as unlikely although not impossible are Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin. In the three remaining states, Kentucky's Legislature does not meet until 1980, while New Hampshire and Rhode Island show some support in the House of Representatives but the Senate votes are in greater doubt. If all three states ultimately petition Congress, however, backers would still fall one state short. No one knows whether there is a limit on the time that advocates of a convention can spend in accumulating 34 petitions because the Constitution is silent and Congress has never legislated in the area. Some constitutional authorities have suggested a seven‐year deadline, adopting the figure that Congress customarily writes into amendments it approves and sends to the states for ratification. Rise in Political Pressures As the number of states calling for a convention approaches the action point, political pressures tend to mount. Advocates of a balanced budget maintain that this situation favors their cause, propelling an undecided legislature toward claiming credit for having started a new national campaign for fiscal restraint. But critics of both a balanced budget and a conention argue that state legislators who felt free to vote for budget balancing under more or less abstract circumstances would be much more cautious if their state faced the prospect of actually setting in motion a constitutional convention. Both houses of Congress have announced hearings on various budget‐balancing amendments, and the Senate versions open tomorrow under the chairmanship of Senator Birch Bayh, Democrat of Indiana, head of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution. Some members are eager that Congress approve ground rules for a constitutional convention in the event 34 states sould some day demand one. Others are reluctant to take this step, fearing it would tend to encourage more state petitions and thus promote bypassing Congress."
Abortion and the 99 Percent,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/12/archives/abortion-and-the-99-percent.html,"For opponents of abortion rights, there's good news from Washington: Restrictions on Medicaid funding have nearly eliminated Federal financing of abortion. The new data confirm what old data suggested: that the current law is proving dramatically effective. In the last 11 months of last year, Federally funded abortions plummeted to 2,421 from an average of 250,000 to 300,000 a year before the law was tightened — a reduction of 99 percent. These data do not mean that all public financing of abortion has been so sharply cut. Many states have followed Washington's lead and now provide abortions for the poor only if the woman's physical health is imperiled or if she is the victim of rape or incest. But 15 states and the District of Columbia continue to pay for abortions for a much broader array of medical reasons. This minority of the states — which includes New York, Illinois, and California — has typically accounted for a majority of Medicaid abortions. If this is still true, these jurisdictions, through their continuing concern for the needs of poor women, may be nullifying twothirds of the Federal Medicaid cutback. Whatever the net effect of the Federal abortion law is now shown to be, it remains a lamentable. punitive intervention into the lives of the poor. Still, the new information compiled by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare might serve a worthwhile purpose. It can demonstrate to Congress that there is no need to tighten the Federal abortion law still more to block cheating, as has been urged by some abortion foes, including H.E.W. Secretary Califano. In nearly a year the Federal Government helped finance only 61 abortions for rape or incest, only 385 to protect the health of the woman, and only 1,857 to save the woman's life. Given such small numbers, there can be no rampant cheating. Indeed, the figures are so low that we are left to wonder how many poor women wound up in the hands of shady practitioners. How many are now the parents of children they did not want and have trouble caring for? Answering such questions would not enable Congress to undo the pain already caused by the current law; but it might help to shape an enlightened future one."
Conservatives Seek Tie With Right to Life Party,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/12/archives/conservatives-seek-tie-with-right-to-life-party-new-york-political.html,"The leadership of the Conservative Party and the new Right to Life Party met quietly in Hicksville, L.I., last week. But as is common with politicians of the major parties, the two sides disagreed on the import and sie New York Political Notes nificance of the meeting, with the Conservative Party attaching more meaning to the gathering and the Right to Life Party attaching less. Serphin R. Maltese, the executive director of the Conservative Party, said that the meeting on Wednesday night of a dozen leaders from both parties was arranged by mutual friends. Noting that the Conservative platform includes a provision opposing abortion and calling for a constitutional ban against it, he said that the session was designed to “discuss our common goals, how we can work together and push these common goals.” Mr. Maltese said that the Right to Life Party, in its first endorsement as legally qualified party, backed the Staten Island Conservative Party chairman, James P. Molinaro, in his bid on the Conservative and Right To Life lines for an Assembly seat in a special election next Tuesday. “A portent of things to come,” said Mr. Maltese who predicted that “in the vast majority of elections,” the two parties would be teamed up. Mary Jane Tobin, the Right to Life candidate for governor last November who ran ahead of Governor Carey on the Liberal Party line, did not see eye to eye with Mr. Maltese. “He's trying to make much more of it than it was,” said Mrs. Tobin, who had initially not disclosed the meeting during an interview. She said thate there was “a camraderie” among the two party leaders “but that's all.” “We are not in a box with the Conservative Party or else we wouldn't have started our party,” said Mrs. Tobin, chairman of a three‐member “interim committee” that is running the new party until county committees are selected throughout the state in the fall primary. Despite the differing views, most politicians expect the two parties to unite with Republicans. Mrs. Tobin said she had met with some Republican legislative leaders but declined to identify them. That special election in the district covering lower Manhattan and a slice of Staten Island not only sparked a Conservative‐Right to Life alliance but also demonstrated the very close ties between the Conservatives and the Republicans. Susan Huckvale managed to win the Republican nomination at county committee meetings over the objections of G.O.P. leaders who had agreed to support Mr. Molinaro. State Senator John J. Marchi of Staten Island, one of the most powerful G.O.P. legislators, who owes his latest re‐election to the Conservative Party vote for him, was so incensed that he discharged a longtime aide, Lynn Fiume, from both his legislative and law office staff for supporting Miss Huckvale. The Senator also bolted his party to endorse the Conservative, Mr. Molinaro. Meanwhile, on the other side of the ,bay, Mr. Marchi's G.O.P. colleague, State Senator Roy M. Goodman, and Representative S. William Green endorsed Miss Huckvale. State Senator Vander L. Beatty, who is spearheading the petition campaign to put a recall provision in the City Charter, is using, it now develops, petitions drawn by the Richmond Hill Block Association. The civic group, whose petitions have been‐in circulation for nearly two months, is very unhappy with Mr. Beatty's selection of Mayor Koch for recall. Copies of the group's petitions were provided Mr. Beatty. “Koch is a good person and we certainly wouldn't pick on him,” said Tom Pugliese, president of the association. He said that the group wanted a recall provision as a check on all city officials. He said that Mr. Beatty's charges of “racism” against the Mayor would only “hurt the petition — an amendment will never pass.” “A lot of people in Richmond Hill are quite upset,” Mr. Pugliese said, adding that he hoped to petition the City Council to put such a Charter amendment on the ballot and if unsuccessful, go the petition route to the ballot. Midge Costanza, the Rochester Democrat who was eased off the White souse staff, is still loyal to President tarter. The first New York State Democrat to support the then unknown Jimmy Carter two years before the Presidential election, Miss Costanza has not been asked yet to help out in any Carter campaign here. Miss Costanza is on the lecture circuit currently and is hoping to write a book — “not an expose, just the story of a woman from Rochester who went to the White House.” She said that “absolutely hilarious New York politics” would be well covered in the book, including her “first encounter” with Meade H. Esposito, the colorful Brooklyn Democratic leader. Patrick J. Cunningham, the former Bronx Democratic chairman who engineered New York City's selection as the Democratic national convention site in 1976, has been appointed to the site selection commttee by the national committee. He was chairman two years ago but is only a member now. New York, which lost out on the Republican convention next year, is again seeking the Democratic meeting, but the same sites are usually not picked two conventions in a row. Its chief competitors are said to be Houston, Seattle and Detroit. Several other cities, including Chicago, New Orleans, Miami and Atlanta, are likely to be ruled out because their states have not approved the proposed equal rights constitutional amendment. Former Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Judah Gribetz, Governor Carey's former counsel, and the Appellate Division's presiding justice, Milton Mollen, are being credited by politicians with a key role in the surprise selection of Justice Herbert B. Evans of the Appellate Division as the state's chief administrative judge. What do they have in common? They all served in the city's Housing Department during the Wagner administration."
Albany Moves Toward Divorce‐Law Change,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/12/archives/albany-moves-toward-divorcelaw-change-revision-sought.html,"Major reform of the law governing distribution of property upon divorce, stalled in the New York State Senate for several years, may have been given new impetus by a decision of the United States Supreme Court last Monday that declared unconstitutional a law restricting eligibility for alimony to women. “Now that the Supreme Court has made it necessary to amend the Domestic Relations Law, of necessity the issue must be high up on the agenda of both houses,” said Arthur J. Cooperman, the Queens Democrat who heads the Judiciary Committee of the New York State Assembly. The effort at reform, marked by Assembly passage of legislation that would make alimony payable to men as well as women and require equitable distribution of property, has foundered in the Senate Judiciary Committee. Explanations vary, but they include the general conservative nature of the committee, the animus toward divorce reform on the part of some members. and, last year. the illness of the chairman, Bernard Gordon, Republican of Peekskill, who subsequently died. The new chairman of the l& member, all‐male committee is H Douglas Barclay, Republican Federal ruling gives impetus to moves for new state legislation. Conservative of Pulaski, who said he was at present familiarizing himself with the 28 areas of law that fall under its jurisdiction. “I can't be an instant expert on all of them,” he observed. But of the socalled divorce reform, he said, “T think there will he come movement.” Revision Sought Although a variety of family law bills are before the Legislature, it is the revision of the property distribution law that is the focus of attention as a result of the Supreme Court decision. Revision, should it take place, is likely to move in directions outlined by Lester W'allman of the Manhattan law firm of Wallman & Kramer. who is the chairman of the committee on legislation of the family section of the New York State Bar Association, This committee e, supporting legislation to amend Section 236 of the Domestic Relations Law. called the Equitable Distribution Law, to make alimony payable to husbands as well as to wives. This would bring New York law into conformity with the last week's United States Supreme Court riling. Assemblyman Cooperman said it was customary for the Legislature to revise state law to bring into conformity with Federal rulings, but that it was his intention not to restrict amendment of Sec. tion 236 to this matter but to deal with comprehensive revision. Mr. wafman said that the family section of the State Bar Association was also proposing that Section 236 be revised to entitle wives to share in the assets of husbands upon divorce, regardless of the fact that the assets, including the husband's business, may be in the husband's name. “Under our law,” said Mr. Wallman, “whatever is in the wife's name, she keeps, and hatever is in the husband's name, he keeps. So in essence in most divorces the husband walks away with all of the assets and the wife gets zero.” Ownership Follows Title At the present time, he observed, 37 states, including Connecticut and New Jersey, but not New York, have enacted either equitable distribution or community property laws to allocate assets upon divorce. New York, he said, is a so‐called common‐law state, where ownership of property upon divorce follows title. The state bar group is also supporting revision of Section 236 to five courts the right to award alimony for a specified period. Current law, Mr. Wallman said, requires that alimony be paid until a wife dies or remarries. As in the past, there is opposition from the family law committee of the Brooklyn Bar Association to the idea of an amendment of Section 236 to make New York the 38th state to have either an equitable distribution or ‐corn munity property law governing distribution of assets upon di vorce. David F. Cohen, the committee's chairman, argues against this proposal on the grounds that it would serve to clog the courts and interfere with the negotiation of separation agreements. Enid Keljik, the vice president nr legislation of NOW N.Y., the New York State component of the National Organization for ‘women, said that the group faored revision of 236 to make it conform to the Supreme Court :Jr vision on alimony, and opposed revision to make New York: an equitable distribution state. 200 Plan Visit to Albany Mrs. Keljik said that some 200 members of the group would travel to Albany tomorrow to lobby. She listed abortion rights as the paramount issue, followed by family law reform, with particular emphasis on improved state performance in a Federal program designed to enforce child support payments. Mrs. Keljik said that NOW N.Y. was also opposed to another revision of the Domestic Relations Law that has the backing of the family section of the State Bar lociation. This is a proposal to revise sec248 to state that alimony would end when a wife lives with a third party, not necessarily a man, and when such a living arrangement causes a change in the wife's financial circumstances. At present, alimony must be paid until a wife remarries or lives. with a man under circumstance In which they hold each other out as husband and wife. “What your private life r should be your private life.” Mrs. Neljik said. “There shouldn't be to nancial strings attached.” “This,” she said of the proposed legislation, “is what we have al ways called the chastity belt.”"
Carey Favors State Casinos But With Private Operators,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/13/archives/carey-favors-state-casinos-but-with-private-operators-better-break.html,"ALBANY, March 12 — Governor Carey said today that he would support “participation under careful controls” by private casino operators if gambling is legalized in New York State. It was his first indication that he favored the involvement of private companies in the state's potentially lucrative gambling market. In previous statements, he had emphasized state‐operated casinos. At a news conference here, Mr. Carey altered his position, saying that to have the state operate all casinos would “require the hiring of a great many more state employees,” which he did not want to do. He indicated that he would favor a combination of state and private operation — possibly having the state rent slot machines to hotels and other semipublic areas for a share of the returns, for example, while letting private companies operate casinos in limited areas of the state, under close state supervision. The statement moved Mr. Carey closer to the position of the Republican‐controlled Senate, whose leaders favor private casino operation. A Senate aide said that the Governor's stand improved the chances that a constitutional amendment permitting casino gambling would be approved this year. The Governor made his remarks at news conference in the Red Room of the Capitol. Mr. Carey also said he expected agreement on a convention center . for New York City to be wrapped up soon. The plans have been snagged on a number of issues, including an insistence by Mayor Koch that he have a say in the operation of the center, although its financing will be provided by the state. “We're close together and I hope the final details can be worked out and we get a bill this week,” Mr. Carey said. Speaking of the Medicaid financing for abortion, the Governor said he hoped the Legislature would separate the issue from the budget and vote on it, but saw no final resolution of the “very thorny issue.” Republicans in the Senate insist they cannot pass a budget that includes money for that purpose, and Democrats in the Assembly insist they cannot pass a budget with money for that purpose removed. Governor Carey maintained that he would have the right to strike language from the budget restricting the state from using Medicaid money for abortions, if it was inserted, but conceded that might be subject to legal challenge. Better Break for Gamblers On casino gambling, the Governor said he wanted a system that would give “the gambler a better break than the one that you can get in certain neighboring or competing states, one where the house doesn't take as much.” “We're not out in this state to generate new dividends and high profits to gambling enterprises,’ Mr. Carey said. ‘We're out to get the best return to the state and still provide gambling.’ The Governor implied that he would favor limited types of gambling in most areas of the state — and only in those areas where the local governments approved — and full casinos in only a few selected places that require the type of “regeneration” that is going on in Atlantic City, where the first New Jersey casino opened last year. The Governor previously had given the impression that he favored casino gambling operated entirely by the state, the position that is held by his Democratic allies in the Assembly. He said today that he was awaiting the report of the Lynch Commission, the 12‐person panel studying casino gambling under Dr. Gerald W Lynch, before elaborating further"
6 Oil Companies Agree to Comply In Part with Albany Price Inquiry,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/14/archives/6-oil-companies-agree-to-comply-in-part-with-albany-price-inquiry.html,"ALBANY, March 13 — Six major oil companies have agreed to partial compliance with subpoenas issued by the State Energy Office in an investigation of their pricing and supply policies, New York State's Energy Commissioner, James L. Larocca, announced today. But how much the six companies Mobil, Exxon, Texaco, Gulf, Shell and Metropolitan Petroleum — would turn over remained a question. They had been asked for a large number and variety of planning documents, projections, Federal forms and internal reports relating to their pricing, distribution, exploration and marketing practices. Mr. Larocca said he had based his assessment on letters from the six companies. “We are not complying with the subpoena as it was originally issued,” a spokesman for Mobil said. “We have agreed to meet with the Commissioner's office on Thursday so he can clarify his views on what information the state needs.” The spokesman added that “much of the information subpoenaed does not relate to New York,” and that some was available in Federal and trade publications. Mobil has been the most recalcitrant of the companies, Mr. Larocca said. Working Out a Schedule The subpoenas were returnable today, and the companies had been expected to fight them. When the investigation was announced on February 23, spokesmen for the companies said collecting material to satisfy the extremely broad subpoenas would be impossible in the time provided, and just how much of the information would be provided remained a question. Mr. Larocc said his office was working with the companies to outline a “mutually agreeable mechanism and schedule” that is intended to get the requested information to the State Energy Office by April 1. He said he believed they had decided to comply because of the difficulty a court battle would entail and the adverse effects it could have on their credibility. The Energy Commissioner ordered the investigation last month, saying that he did not believe “the usual reasons” for oil‐price increases such as the cutoff of oil from Iran, and criticizing the Carter Administration's “apparent inability” to come to grips with the problem. Elsewhere in the capital today, there were these occurrences : Welfare Reform Stating that the chance Of a welfaregrant increase this year is small, the Senate's 25‐member Democratic minority announced its intention to go to Washington en masse to demand that President Carter fulfill his 1976 promise for a Federal takeover of local welfare costs. “There is a confrontation between the poor and those of moderate income,” said Senator Manfred Ohrenstein, the minority leader, adding that an increase could not come “on the backs of people paying property taxes.” He said that “we expect the President will respond.” A Day of Lobbying Legislators were beseiged by lobbyists representing a panoply of interests. Representatives from the Right‐to‐Life organization, carrying artifical red rases, visited legislators to demand that money for Medicaid‐financed abortions be removed from the state budget. In the halls, they passed lobbyists from the National Organization of Women, more than 200 of whom came here to try to preserve the abortion funds, and to call for laws giving equal division of property in divorce settlements, establishing shelters for battered women, and protecting civil rights for lesbians and homosexual men. Lobbyists from the New York State School Board Association were here promoting their agenda, and clumps of sign‐carrying homeowners from upstate New York also went from office to office, demanding action to reduce their property taxes."
Antiabortion Amendment Gains,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/14/archives/antiabortion-amendment-gains.html,"NASHVILLE, March 13 (AP) — After an hour's debate and viewing of color photographs of human fetuses, the Tennessee Senate approved a resolution urging an amendment ‐to the United States Constitution outlawing most abortions.

Lobbyists Join Forces Against Federal Disclosure Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/15/archives/lobbyists-join-forces-against-federal-disclosure-law.html,"WASHINGTON, March 14 ‐The list of witnesses on Capitol Hill this morning was filled with the names of familiar lobbying groups. There were the people who want to ban pistols and those who are op‘posed; those who want to outlaw abortions and those who favor free choice; the Business Roundtable and the National Wildlife Federation. But the difference today was that ail these groups were on the same side. This Washington version of the lions lying down with the lambs took place at hearing held by the Subcommittee on Administrative Law — and Governmental Relations of the House Judiciary ComMittee. At issue was a bill that would require lobbyists to disclose many of their activitierand who pays for them. When it comes to their own self-interest, even lobbyists who spend their lives fighting each other can make peace. In this case the lobbyists are seeking to weaken the disclosure bill or kill it outright. s Their main complaint is that a strong lobbying bill would impose such burdensome reporting procedures that some groups would be forced to curtail or abandon their activities. ‘ Backers of a strong bill say it is part of a continuing effort to make all stages of Government, from campaign contributions to committee amendments, more visible to the voters. “The public has right to know of the significant, organized outside pressures exerted on Government decision‐making,” said Michael Cole, legislative director of Common cause, the public affairs lobby. The current statute that governs lobbying was passed in 1946 and is alleged to be filled with loopholes. As a result, most lobbyists easily avoid many of its re- quirements. in the last two Congresses, tougher bills have passed one house of Congress or the other, only to die in the final, frantic days of the session. This year, even opponents of the concept believe that some type of bill will probably pass. As a result, the debate now centers on what type of legislation to pass and has come to focus on four key issues. The most important of these, and the most difficult to resolve, involves socalled grass‐roots lobbying, an increasingly popular weapon in the lobbyist's arsenal. Basically, it is a technique in which a large organization urges its members or affiliated groups to carry out the actual lobbying in Congress. Advocates of a strong law say these indirect efforts should be covered by the bill's reporting procedures, or else the law would produce a distorted picture of a group's lobbying activity. Opponents contend that grass‐roots lobbying is very difficult to define or monitor, and that an organization could easily violate the law even with the best of intentions. The second major conflict is over proposal to require lobbyists to disclose their large organizational contributors. Mr. Cole of Common Cause said that many lobbying groups with innocuous names were really front groups for concerns with high stakes in the outcome. But Rhea Cohen of the Sierra Club contended that such a provision would give investigators the right to examine an organization's membership list and could discourage some people from supporting unpopular causes. The third issue involves penalties for violating the law. The original legislation proposed this year would impose criminal penalties, but there is a growing-consensus that civil penalties would be more appropriate. The fourth issue focuses on the size of the organizations covered by the law. Supporters of a strong bill want to include as many groups as possible, but, opponents say that smaller lobbying groups with limited budgets simply could not afford the paperwork."
Notes on People,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/16/archives/notes-on-people-jeffrey-bell-will-head-economic-research-foundation.html,"Jeffrey Bell Will Head Economic Research Foundation There's a lot of glory in running for the United States Senate. even when you lose, says Jeffrey Bell, who went down to glorious defeat at the hands of Bill Bradley in New Jersey last year. But one always winds up with a campaign debt, in his case a whopping 5200,000, so since November Mr. Bell. ..vho moved to New Jersey specifically to seek the Republican nomination for Senator, has been working fulltime asking supporters to help pay the bills. His debt has been pared to about ‘+,‐) .000. ‐.So I felt I could now go back to work for a living,” Mr. Bell said yesterday, a- he took over as president and executv.‐e director of the International Cent r for Economic Policy Studies, a nonprofit foundation formed in 1977 to ‐ponsor research in all fields of econ..inics. Mr. Bell. a writer and publicpolicy analyst who worked for Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan in their quests for the Presidency, said he has no political plans “this year.” But New .1crseyans should note that he plans to c:.,ntinue to live in Trenton, making the long daily commute to his office in M‐inhattan. New Sloan Fund Chief One of the more important foundation jobs in the country has gone to Dr. Albert E. Rees, a Princeton economist who for a time headed the Council on Wage and Price Stability under President Gerald R. Ford. On May 1, Dr. Rees will take over as president of the New York‐based Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, which may be dwarfed by such giants as the Ford Foundation, but wields considerable influence with $250 million in capital assets and roughly $15 million in yearly grants and appropriations. Since its creation in 1934, the Sloan Foundation has concentrated on research in the natural sciences, education and management, and to a lesser degree, Dr. Rees's field of economics. He has no plans to change the organization's direction, he said, but that does nt,: hold true for himself. Lately, he has 1-)4.-,en doing research in Cambridge, Mass., and now must obviously move hack to the New York area. “We rented !li house in Princeton to the Boy .;(..‐,uts of America,” he said, adding: ‐They used it for their chief executive. we don't have Cub Scouts running all the lawn.” `Old Man’ Green “This is not a new career move on my part, I want that understood,” Adolph Green said. “I'm acting in movie only because I admire the writer of it. I'm not doing anything to hurt my partnership with Betty Comden.” Mr. Green, who has been in the Broadway writer‐lyricist business with Miss Comden since 1944, when they collaborated on “On the Town,” has just finished filming a two‐day role in “Simon,” written and directed by Marshall Brickman. “I did the part — it's really very small — because I admire Marshall and I wanted to finally make my movie debut,” said Mr. Green. “Betty and were supposed to have made our film debuts in something called ‘Greenwich Village’ with Don Ameche back in 1944, but they cut all of my part and all but one line of Betty's. Now that I'll at last be in a picture, I have no desire to go more deeply into films.” Asked to describe his role in “Simon” he said, “Frankly, I don't know much about it. read the script only once, fast, and think my character is called Old Man.” Marvin Hamlisch Tells How His Star Was Born The making of a Broadway show is aiways a subject of interest, and Marvin Hamlisch offered some insights recently into the casting process of his latest musical, “They're Playing Our Song,” which is loosely based on his relationship with Carole Bayer Sager, the lyricist. At a course on film‐making at the New School for Social Research, taught by Richard Brown, Mr. Hamlisch said the original choice for the female lead was not Lucie Arnaz, who got the role, but Gilda Radner, who “had the madcap zaniness we were after.” However, Miss Radner was unavailable, which turned out to be just as well, the composer said, because after seeing her at a party with the show's male lead, Robert Klein, he realized that they would be too busy “jockeying for position.” Next came Karen Black. She seemed terrific at the first audition, but less so the second time around. “She's a brilliant actress who shines in film,” Mr. Hamlisch said. “But on Broadway you don't get nine shots.” And that led to Miss Arnaz, who though last was hardly least, he said. What she had, according to Mr. Hamlisch, was “exuberance” and the fact that “her talent .is consistent.” Dr. Edelin Promoted by Boston University Remember Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin? He's the Boston doctor who was found guilty of killing an unborn fetus in legal abortion in 1975. His manslaughter conviction, in one of the more important abortion cases since the United States Supreme Court's 1973 ruling that abortion is legal, was later overturned by the Massachusetts Supreme Court. Yesterday Dr. Ededlin, who has been teaching at Boston University since 1974, was named chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the university's School of Medicine. The appointment followed his recent assumption of duties as head of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Boston City Hospital. The Marvin Syndrome What hath Michele Marvin wrought with her court fight against the actor Lee Marvin? Since she won a ruling in California that courts may hear cases in which a former mistress seeks a portion of her former lover's wealth, dozens of other women, several of them the professed former live‐in companions of show‐business personalities, have followed her suit suit by, well, filing suit. All things being equal in this age of equal rights, it was perhaps inevitable that someone would file a suit like the one Randall Jones initiated this week in Santa Monica, Calif., to obtain a portion of the S2 million estate left by James Daly, the actor. Mr. Jones maintains that in 1976 he moved into Mr. Daly's apartment and lived with him as lover, cook, housekeeper and traveling companion until the actor's death last July.

On Language,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/18/archives/on-language-asaps-fables-superflack-all-pro-white-houseese.html,"When this column stumbled on the stage, eyes blinking at the bright lights of Sunday, a question was posed to readers: When you want somebody to call you back in a hurry, but you do not want to alarm them with fears of a medical emergency, what word do you use? “Urgent” is too strong a word; besides, its overuse leaves nothing available in case of a genuine emergency. For example, the French Embassy in Washington sends out all its press releases marked “urgent” — even to pass on the dreary information that “government will spur growth,” as if growth were a horse. The French Ambassador should ponder Talleyrand's advice to diplomats: “Above all, not too much zeal.” “Pressing” is the word suggested by one reader, presumably a tailor. Another claims that “mini‐emergency” works without striking fear, and an airline executive suggests “without fail.” A gentle soul suggests “When he has a chance, please have him call me back,” which never works for me. A former government official offers “Please expedite response,” and a puckish attorney gets results with “with all deliberate speed.” One Penelope K. Amabile, who describes herself as a “barnstormer, balloonist and adventurer,” uses “or else” on her phone messages — return her call “or else.” Since many phone messages are now left on a recording following a beep, some readers report they use a bit of vigorish in their tone of voice. “Very important,” normally banal, can be delivered on a recorded message‐taker with weight, sexiness and mystery. Sondra Langford of Chatham, N.J., has this dramatic technique: “I can move my friends to return a call quickly by stating my name and phone number, and no more, in a weak voice.” The implicit message: Call before it is too late. The word, or acronym, that was suggested most frequently was “ASAP” — “as soon as possible.” “Soonest,” a term from telegraphese, was another favorite. Max Frankel, editor of the New York Times editorial page (which appears regularly opposite the Op‐Ed page), adds a note of poignancy: “In emergencies, I say I am anxious. Otherwise, I say I am eager. Preserving the distinction is one of my personal, losing causes.” Superflack Sometimes it takes a great press agent to come up with the perfect word. In Washington, Joe Laitin is one of the veteran press agents who work under various titles in different agencies as administrations come and go, always landing on his feet because he has that certain touch with words. When the astronauts, circling the moon on Christmas Eve, moved mankind with a reading from Genesis in the Bible — that was Joe, operating on the global scale. Now he works for Treasury Secretary Mike Blumenthal. He had been urging his client to travel to China, where Blumenthal had spent eight years as a youth. “Shanghai is your log cabin,” Joe told him. So Blumenthal recently made his sentimental journey, accompanied by a dozen reporters who dutifully reported the Secretary's trade negotiations at a most delicate moment in diplomacy. The problem was that Blumenthal was in Peking, helping the Chinese launch their modernization drive, at a time when the United States was officially frowning on China's invasion of Vietnam. How to sound tough and disapproving — without being offensive? The word chosen by Blumenthal in China to describe the Chinese move across its Vietnamese border was “transgression.” I had not heard that word used since Negley Farson's “The Way of a Transgressor,” a memoir of a foreign correspondent first published in IDS. ‘'transgression'’ means“movement across a line,” whether actually moving across a border or figuratively stepping beyond the bounds. The more accurate word for the Chinese action is “aggression,” which also has the meaning of stepping across a line (the “gress,” or grade, means “step”) but carries the connotation of attack. In inter national law, aggression is condemned, and the use of that word by Blumenthal would have been considered insult mg. When the perfect choice —“transgression” — came over the wires from China, I asked, “Who's with Blumenthal?” Answer: Joe Laden. It figured. I shot a message to Joe in Peking about the word, and received this message hack from him: “I accept brickbats but riot bouquets. The word is Secretary Blumenthal's.” Always a pleasure dealing with a pro. All Pro A decade ago, people were “pro‐abortion” or “anti‐aborKimble Meaa Two equally loaded phrases encapsulate opposing views on the abortion issue: You're either ‘pro‐life’ or ‘pro‐choice.’ tion.” Now the debate is between people who are. “prolife” or “pro‐choice.” What brought about this double switch in sloganeering? After the 1973 Supreme Court decision prohibiting states from making abortion illegal early in pregnancy, opponents of abortion reached for a handle that would not be considered negative. A good example was available in the generation‐old movement to oppose the union shop, which called itself “right‐to‐work” rather than “anti‐union.” On that analogy, “anti‐abortion” became “right‐to‐life,” and later, to save valuable bumper‐sticker space, “prolife.” (Nellie Gray, president of March for Life, popularized the latter; she has also been pushing “preborn” rather than “unborn” in order to state more positively the living nature of the unborn child, seeking the analogy of “prenatal.”) Supporters of the campaign to strike down laws prohibiting abortion were caught by surprise at the strong reaction to their court victory, and were flummoxed by the powerful “pro‐life” slogan. They could hardly march under banners proclaiming themselves to be “anti‐life”: an even more negative and unacceptable alternative was “pro‐death.” How could people who were in favor of legal abortion put forward their position positively and punchily? Here's how, as they say in the ad game: The Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights picked up the idea of “rights” from their opponents; they combined it with an old anti‐integration slogan (“freedom of choice”) and put forward “right‐to‐choose.” The message in this slogan reached beyond those who already favored legal abortion and appealed to many who had not yet made up their minds. Then, as “right‐to‐life” became “pro‐life,” “right‐tochoose” followed right along with “pro‐choice.” So now we have two equally loaded phrases encapsulating the opposing views: “prolife,” which implicitly derogates all those who disagree as killers, and “pro‐choice,” which implicitly derogates ail those who disagree as dictators. A matched pair of pistols for a bitter duel. White House‐ese Argot used by White House aides soon percolates through government, then — perhaps on a trickle‐down theory —reaches the people. A few years ago, “impacted” was very big, as an affected synonym for “affected” — “How does supplemental assistance impact on our constituency?” Similarly, “targeted” became voguish, replacing “tailored” on pressing concerns. These verbs will probably go the way of “spearhead” and “pinpoint” into the jargon graveyard. But some terms are colorful and descriptive. “A White House aide,” wrote Steven Weisman in The New York Times, “also said that Stuart Eizenstat was still ‘bent out of shape’ by the Governor's comment.” The picture of the angular Domestic Council aide twisted like a pretzel after a blast from Hugh Carey is vivid and a good use of language. The jury is still out on “We'll close that loop later.” The “loop” bandied about in the White House is not a short form of “loophole,” but an electronic loop that keeps a tape playing forever. To say “I'm not in that loop” is to say “That is not my area of responsibility” in an excitingly trendy way. We'll keep an eye on that figure of speech. Wordwatchers are in that loop. ■"
"‘Tractorcade’ Demonstrators Go Home, Leaving Mostly Anger Behind",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/18/archives/mass-protest-has-simply-gone-out-of-style.html,"WASHINGTON — Dave Bosle left his corn field in Hastings, Neb. on Jan. 18 and drove his tractor here to join hundreds of other farmers in demands for higher farm prices. Last week, as the “tractorcade” demonstrators were trickling home, he was well aware that many in Washington felt that they had succeeded only in causing damage — an estimated $3.6 million worth to the capital, and untold political damage to themselves. “We didn't know what to do after last year,” said Mr. Bosle, referring to the farmers’ unsuccessful efforts to get a new farm bill passed in 1978. “We were disappointed, and we felt we had to go out and put our point across.” The farmers found, however, that turning out in great numbers and disrupting the capital does not necessarily put the point across. As a political tactic, mass protests have simply gone out of style in Washington. The great sense of certainty that once set souls to stirring and feet to marching over issues such as civil rights, poverty and the Vietnam war has given way to an era of limits and confusion. “The country is in kind of a testy mood right now,” said Representative John Brademas, the Democratic whip in the House. “I don't think people like to be threatened, and protest tactics can backfire. The climate is not so congenial to that anymore.” Today, trying to influence Congress is a sophisticated business. Those who do it successfully may occasionally carry picket signs, but they are more likely to carry computer printouts and campaign contributions. The outcome of other recent demonstrations suggests that it also helps to choose a cause that has fairly broad support to begin with. The dramatic long march of the American Indians last year, for example, had little practical effect on Congress, in large part because the Indians were seen as an economic threat by many white constituents back home. Supporters of the Equal Rights Amendment staged a peaceful demonstration here last year that probably helped convince Congress to extend the deadline for ratifying the amendment. But the real work on that issue was done through face‐to‐face persuasion in Capitol offices, and some of the most effective advocates were wives of Senators and Representatives. Opponents of Federal funding for abortions have also held periodic demonstrations, and they have largely succeeded in their legislative goals. But there, the muscle came from the Roman Catholic Church and other organized groups that courted votes with personal lobbying, and could be counted as a voting bloc on election day. The farmers had little back‐up strategy to go along with their street protests this winter, especially in the beginning. Furthermore, their cause was not widely seen as just or popular. “At a time of rising food prices and rising income for farmers,” Representative Brademas noted, “it's unreasonable to assume that a protest in support of more government spending to boost prices would be effective.” Other Congressmen said they thought the American Agricultural Movement protesters were unwise to come across as aggressive and threatening. At a Senate hearing last Tuesday, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and a member of the Agriculture Committee, angrily told protest leaders, “You have hurt the cause of farmers.” To which Butch Neal, a movement supporter, retorted, “If there is any blame, it must rest with the Congress and the Carter Administration for allowing agriculture in America to get into such a position.” “I believe in passive protest, like [Dr. Martin Luther] King or Gandhi,” said Representative Richard Bolling, Democrat of Missouri. “The farmers got out of hand.” For what good it did them, the farmers were at least noticed; that was an objective, and one of the reasons for staging the kind of stunts that television and newspapers somehow can't ignore. Said Tim Maguire of Wood River, Neb., “It's a crying shame, the way we have to get on the news in this country. The people back home didn't even know we were here until we threw that goat over the White House fence.” Even under the best of circumstances, however, mass protests probably could not carry the weight today that they did 10 or 15 years ago. No issue seems as simple as it once did, and, as one Congressional staff member put it, “Every Congressman has to satisfy many constituencies back in his district. If one group comes in and says, ‘You've got to do it our way or we'll kick you out,’ that gets his back up.” The smartest opinion‐changers on Capitol Hill today are the ones who know the facts of an issue, and how it will affect a Congressman's own district. Information is power, and it has become far more efficient to change a member's outlook than twist his arm. It often pays to call on constituents of the Congressman to do the actual lobbying, as the National Education Association has done in its campaign for a separate, Cabinet‐level department of education. School administrators and teachers have been recruited from all over the country to visit Washington and press their case with their home‐state representatives. Meanwhile, the more traditional kind of lobbying, by paid professionals, has become somewhat more difficult because power has been diffused and younger Congressmen now control many important subcommittees. “It's very hard work to understand this place,” Representative Brademas said. “The only way to win,” said Michael Cole, legislaive dir6ctor of Common Cause, “is to develop the capacity to do things on the inside. Things don't happen solely because outraged people show up in Washington. That doesn't mean the end of demonstrations, but you have to do both.” The New York Times Conklin/ Mankmeyer ; Got goni/Contact UPI Recent protests by farmers, Indians and pro‐E.R.A. demonstrators in Washington."
A GENERATION OF ‘LOST’ SCHOLARS,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/18/archives/a-generation-of-lost-scholars-scholars.html,"Not long ago, The Claremont Courier, a smalltown newspaper in California, received this job application: “I graduated last month from U.C.L.A. with a Ph.D. in philosophy. I am now looking for a job in the real world since the academic world is apparently closed to me. I would like to write for The Courier. I do not type very fast but I use all 10 fingers.” The letter epitomizes an unhappy reality of the 70's. For the past nine years, American universities have produced more Ph.D.'s in the humanities than the college and university teaching market can absorb. The humanities include English, history, philosophy, art history and foreign languages and literatures, and are distinct from the social sciences or the biological and physical sciences. As humanities enrollments continue to decline at the undergraduate level, the problem of where to employ these Ph.D.'s has worsened, and gradually the value of the doctorate and the morale of university faculties have been seriously affected. A profession that traditionally prided itself on its gentility and immunity from the raw practices of the marketplace now finds itself unable to employ more than about one in three humanities Ph.D.'s. At the moment, the best word to describe the world of humanities higher education is confused. Institutions question their degree programs, yet continue them. Students, some of them either ignorant or misled, pursue courses of study that may enlighten the mind but will likely lead to unemployment. It may be difficult for anyone not actually involved in graduate education to appreciate the gravity of the situation or even to sympathize with its most obvious victims, those students who spend years working for a doctorate only to find it of no practical use. Perhaps the plight of the unemployed Ph.D. deserves little attention compared to far more critical unemployment problems in America today. But these jobless Ph.D.'s are merely the visible detritus, the inescapable reality, of a system of higher education that ‐ unsure of its priorities and inclined, like government, to self‐perpetuation ‐ no longer can be said to be performing its job well. The inefficiency of American higher education is everyone's concern, and when we look closely at what has happened individually to many of our brightest, most intellectually energetic students, frustrated in their careers and disillusioned with the life of the mind, we can apprehend the human price of a system out of step with social and economic realities. Within colleges and universities, faculties grow stagnant as young people are either not hired at all or are let go after two or three years in favor of new Ph.D.'s who draw lower salaries, take on the most burdensome courses, and can look forward to being fired before they reach tenure. Morale among new faculty and graduate students hovers at zero, and the very people who should be injecting fresh ideas and enthusiasm into higher education have become its most expendable segment. The values of the academic world have become progressively inverted, as traditional successes — getting into the best schools, winning fellowships, writing brilliant dissertations — turn out to increase the likelihood of professional failure. Professors complain that students have become too hard‐nosed, too pragmatic, unable to immerse themselves in learning for its own sake. But this is hardly surprising when the world of ideas is unable to accommodate its own young. And, whatever pleasure one might derive from the thought that the fellow pumping your gas might have lines from the Aeneid running through his head, it is regrettable that he may never have the chance to pass on his learning to young people. Statistics provided by academic and professional organizations are difficult to interpret and can be misleading. The spring 1979 issue of the Modern Language Association's Newsletter reports that a poll of English and foreignlanguage departments shows that approximately 64 percent of those receiving their doctorates in English in 1977‐78 have found “full‐time academic employment.” But what kind of employment is this? How many of these jobs carry the possibility of permanent employment, and is the work worthy of a highly trained professional? In the spring 1978 issue of the Newsletter, a graduate student writes of his frustration with the attitude of senior professors and administrators: “The faculty members, as far as I can tell, have still not absorbed the present nonjob market, nor have they dealt with the implications of the kinds of teaching jobs that are sometimes still available.” By 1995 — according to a forthcoming study by Ernest R. May of Harvard and Dorothy G. Harrison of the State Education Department of New York — if overall Ph.D. production remains at the current level, “a student enrolling in a Ph.D. program will have about as much chance of having a career as a professor as he or she would rolling a seven in a single cast of dice. He or she will face odds of about 5 to The oversupply of Ph.D.'s has led institutions to treat young faculty members as potentially expensive commodities, useful economically at the lower salary levels but better gotten rid of as they approach tenure and the time of significant pay increases If there is a talented young Ph.D. out there eager for a job, why pay more for essentially the same product? Many colleges and universities have taken to hiring part‐time help, teachers who not only draw lower salaries but fail to qualify for fringe benefits such as healthand life‐insurance and retirement programs. The present oversupply came about early in the 1970's, when the last war‐baby generation passed from undergraduate colleges into graduate schools, leaving fewer undergraduates to teach, and reducing the number of teaching positions. Many Ph.D. programs have been cut back, but economic forces peculiar to the academy have kept universities, especially the nation's largest, turning out more Ph.D.'s than the market can bear. But the most powerful factor causing the continued overproduction of Ph.D.'s is the usefulness of graduate students in keeping down instructional costs to undergraduates. At Washington University in St. Louis, for example, graduate students teach many of the freshmen at a cost far less than that of regular professors. Some graduate students will normally teach four courses per academic year (considered a full teaching load at W.U.) at a salary of $1,000 per course. Even a lowranking assistant professor costs the university three timts that. Salaries vary slightly from place to place, but most universities take advantage of a cheap labor force in the same way. Graduate students also save the professors from teaching courses they find tedious or boring — freshman composition, for example, or numerous sections in an introductory philosophy course. Without the graduate students, universities would have to offer far fewer courses. Their catalogues would look less impressive, less attractive to potential undergraduates, because that seminar in Tolstoy or Norman Mailer would have to be dropped. Its teacher would be too busy correcting some freshman's grammar. So it is that in spite of the depressed job market, graduate humanities programs still actively recruit students. But even landing a “tenure‐track” position is rarely the achievement of job security these days. because the young professors can find themselves off the track in a matter of months. Young Ph.D.'s who find the doors of the academy suddenly closed to them feel helpless, at least at first. These are middle‐class people, almost all of them, who have been meeting every standard set for them since they entered school. Feeling defeated, often bewildered by the sudden devaluation of their greatest pride, their intelligence, many drift into unchallenging, monotonous jobs because they cannot see themselves as fit for a demanding business position. Many tenured professors are acutely depressed by the current academic scene. “It has ruined graduate teaching,” says Robert Solomon, 36, professor of philosophy at the University of Texas at Austin. “I tell my students not to go on except for the love of the subject, but they don't believe me. No matter what I tell them, graduate students these days can't think about anything but getting a job. I may be analyzing existentialism, but they look on me as a job‐finder. My warnings fall on deaf ears.” Marcus Klein, professor and for several years director of placement for the English Department at the State University of New York at Buffalo, takes a somewhat tougher line. He tries to get students jobs, and his department has a successful placement rate well above the national average. But he doesn't think that students should be warned, as they enter the program, that jobs may not be found for them. “They're adults.” he says. “If they don't know what the score is, it's not up to us to tell them….” “In some respects the future will be like the 1950's,” Professor Klein says. “Jobs were scarce then too. Not everyone got hired.” The gloom that has already descended on the academy will not soon dissipate. Even tenured professors who try to ignore the plight of their younger colleagues are feeling trapped. Most of them are no longer in a position to bargain for higher salaries, because administrators know how few jobs are available elsewhere. A shift of power from faculties to administrations has taken place everywhere. Administrators know that most of their employees have nowhere else to go. Professors are naturally wary of speaking out on controversial subjects, and the custom of tenure itself is under heavy fire. Thomas F. Staley, former dean of the graduate school at the University of Tulsa, suggests one bright spot: “Because there are so many good job candidates, faculties have improved at many out‐of‐theway schools that were pretty mediocre 10 years ago. Students at what were secondrate colleges are now getting first‐rate educations, because the guy teaching them may be as good as anyone at Harvard.” But after offering this bit of optimism, Professor Staley shakes his head and sighs. “Oh. well. Maybe I'm just grasping at straws.” Lately, as the dismal employment prospects for Ph.D.'s have become impossible to ignore, some graduate programs have been hard put to keep going. It is a factor rarely acknowledged, impossible of proof, and yet true, that in all but the most prestigious schools, graduate admissions standards have been lowered. Some graduate professors, none wishing to be quoted, speak of their classes filling up with unqualified students who have been admitted only to keep the degree programs in operation. “A lot of them use books the way people do needlepoint, just to have some thing to do,” one senior professor says. “They see a place to spend a few years, maybe even on a scholarship, and they fill up the seats. I don't worry about them. They don't care that much about getting a job.” Another professor terms these new students “the literate illiterates. Well, what the hell, they pay my salary.” When it comes time to judge the qualifying examinations for the “literate illiterates,” to see whether they will be allowed to write a dissertation, the last step before the doctorate, they are sometimes let through: “What else are we going to do with them? Put ourselves out of business?” The ultimate result of the current chaos and malaise will probably be a healthy purging of the system. Eventually fewer and fewer students will apply, forcing a reduction in courses and in faculty, by attrition if not by firing, and graduate education will occupy a place more in proportion to the real demand for it. But in the meantime, one must think not merely of the money wrongly spent by students, university and government, but of the good young minds that have been trained to a doubtful end, the resources of their intelligence dissipated. Surely we have wasted their talents much as we have wasted other forms of energy, and the toll on their personal lives has often been great. Over the past year I have talked to numerous Ph.D.'s who for one reason or another have been hurt by the job crisis. Their stories differ, but here are three representative cases. Perhaps these portraits can convey on a human level something of what it is like to be a young humanities Ph.D. graduate these days : DENNIS GRUNES Dennis Grimes, 31, received his Ph.D. in English from the State University at Buffalo in 1974. He is not a professor, but he has been trying to be one since 1973, the first year that he sent out more than a thousand letters to every college and university in the land, including every one listed at the back of Webster's New World Dictionary, telling of his achievements and aspirations. asking for a job. He got no job in 1973. nor in 1974, when he sent as many letters again. The response was uniformly negative: Not one institution wished to grant him an interview. On this day he was going to the house of his former teacher, Prof. Leslie Fiedler, for an interview with me on the subject of the job crisis facing Ph.D.'s in the humanities. When Dennis entered the large, cheerful old house of the Fiedlers, he showed the pleasure of someone returning home for a visit, as though being in his professor's house recaptured some of the joys and hopes of student days, when Dennis had believed himself destined for the scholar's life. There were warm greetings; whisky and cheese were set out; for a few minutes talks revolved around the success of Professor Fiedler's book “Freaks.” Then the Fiedlers withdrew, and the interview began. Dennis was born in Brooklyn and moved to Long Island, where his father was a tea salesman and Dennis attended Bay Shore High School. He was a diligent student, loving science especially, and amassing a rock collection. He read a lot, but not what we think of as literature. In a soft, rich voice, resonant with self‐deprecating humor, Dennis told of being admitted to Harpur College in Binghamton, then known as Governor Rockefeller's baby, the jewel in the crown of the State University system. He recalled being overwhelmed by the intelligence of the other students. At first he doubted that he would survive, and he did poorly in literature. Dennis has never been a person to plan ahead, never one to calculate the future. If an incident from the past crops up, he relives it in loving detail, and in the present he appears to experience a sense of timelessness, as though every second ought to be prolonged and savored for its own sake. One can easily imagine him as the sort of teacher who enthralls students by his verbal gifts and keeps them happily after class, with no one caring that the hour has passed. “In college I didn't know what I had in mind to do.. Finally my teacher, William Bysshe Stein — he had a wife named Gertrude — he turned me on to literature. I ended up being a poet. I still am.” Dennis entered the State University at Buffalo in 1969 with a fellowship as a Ph.D. student in English. He was a teaching assistant and discovered that he loved teaching and was very good at it. He was also successful as a graduate student, and he completed his degree without difficulty. “I didn't think about the future, I only wanted to get through. It never occurred to me I'd have difficulty getting some sort of teaching job. Difficulty!” Regarded highly by the faculty, Dennis was touted by them as one of their top job candidates. But when he failed to get so much as an interview for two years, other students hinted that he might have a blackballing letter of recommendation in his dossier. This turned out not to be the case, but it made him frightened and suspicious. He was by that time supporting himself by doing odd jobs. He was a Fuller Brush man and a telephone operator, and when I interviewed him, he was working for a government‐sponsored group called Bet on a Vet, which helps veterans find jobs. His salary was $125 a week. But he has been doing everything he can to try to make himself academically more employable. Recently he had his seventh scholarly article published, and since only a small percentage of currently employed college and university professors ever write and publish anything after their dissertations, Dennis's accomplishment is considerable. He has written for American Imago and the Ball State University Forum on subjects such as “Donne's ‘The Good Morrow” and “The King's Caught Conscience,” a study of “Hamlet.” In 1975, he traveled to San Francisco to the annual meeting of the Modern Language Association, where he had been granted an interview by one college. He was not hired. A year later, he had an interview with the University of Southern California. “I think I blew that one by admitting that I didn't drive.” And last year, responding to every advertised job opening in his field, he failed to land a single interview. He has given up: “I now realize that I will never have a teaching job.” For a time Dennis was resentful, believing that his professors couldn't possibly be pushing hard enough on his behalf, but now he says, “I leave resentment to my grandmother.” He doesn't know what he'll do next. “I may go to Portland. I have some friends there. It's a nice place.” Dennis is cut out to be a college professor. He loves learning and speculative thought for its own sake. Does he think the profession has lost something by not having him in it? “Oh, definitely,” he says, his quarter‐moon grin curling upward in a sad smile. “After all, I made my students love literature.” And how does he feel about the prospect of having to go out into the world and sell himself? “Sell myself? What do you mean?” he asks, not understanding the question at all, rejecting it with a show of his palms, a response expressing perfectly the most cherished ideals of the academy. EVELYN MARDER “I couldn't conceive of being anything but a professor,” says Evelyn Marder, “until the business world was forced on me. So what do you know? All of a sudden I realize I love it I love the flimflam and the bull and the hype and all of it. I don't spend so much time thinking about myself and what contributions I'm going to make to the monument that is Western civilization, and, guess what, I'm a much healthier person. I like the air out here. I never would have believed it.” In spite of this enthusiasm, Evelyn Marder was an unwilling subject for this article. She would nut allow her real name to be used, and over a period of days she vacillated about talking to me at all about her academic trials, finally agreeing to make anonymous comments. She feels that if she were to speak her mind publicly about her experiences, she would sever any remaining ties she has to academia, and she says that many of the things that happened to her are still too painful for her to be able to bear reading about. Yet, as is so often the case with professors who have been fired, former employers and colleagues knew nothing of her current activities and supplied an endless string of false leads to her. This elusiveness is not unique. A fired professor, no longer connected with a university, tends to become a nonperson to the academic world, like a defrocked priest to the Church. But Evelyn would like to feel that bonds still exist between her and the academy. She still loves her field, philosophy, and says that she will go on “doing” philosophy for the rest of her life: “I'll make some kind of impact, somehow, eventually. That's why I can't bad‐mouth anybody now. Do you see? Look, I can't jeopardize myself. And I can't go through it all to you. It's too painful to remember.” There was a note of mild hysteria to her voice, the words tumbling out. Evelyn went through three different firings on short‐term contracts. In her first two jobs, she was given deadlines for finishing her dissertation. That she had been hired at all before finishing her degree was evidence to her then of her brilliance. Now she wonders. “O.K., so I was brilliant. Anyway I always got A's and I could talk. But now I think they hired me because, without my dissertation finished, they had a built‐in excuse to fire me. Did they give me time to finish? Just the opposite. In both places I was loaded down with all the work the senior professors wouldn't touch. I didn't have a chance to finish. “But after I got the ax the second time, I figured I had to get it done, and I did, in one miserable summer. So I got another job. ‘Tenure‐track’ this time. Sure! After a year I could see the handwriting on the wall.” Evelyn says that the anxiety among junior colleagues is so great that they are reluctant to promote themselves among senior faculty, for fear they might cost a friend a job. And as for personal life: “I was a wreck. I was losing my sense of identity. I threw myself into love affairs and made a complete fool of myself. I even had one with a senior colleague. I hated myself for that. And that led to one of two abortions I had during that time. I was a total mess. “When I could see they were going to fire me, I asked around at other places, and it was obvious I could still get a job. I was still hirable, maybe because my salary was still so low. Suddenly I had a sense, this is it. I'm not going through this anymore. So here I am. I love it.” She has started a consulting firm (she refused to say what field she was consulting in) but she feels that somehow she will be able to stay in philosophy: “In 10 years I can bring hack something to the philosophical community. Philosophy is bigger than the number of tenured professors. I love it and it will always be a part of me.” Evelyn says that academics go into their work partly to avoid pressures common elsewhere, so they can't face what is happening in their world now: “They pass the buck. They get academic. They blame trends or economic forces, when it's really about people and the way they behave to one another. And of course the administrators with their fat salaries have no heart at all except for budgets.” When Evelyn was pressed about her anonymity, she became anxious and defensive. Didn't the academic world in its present crisis need people like her to speak out? Wasn't she being too timid, too much like the academics she accuses of passing the buck? “Maybe so. You just don't understand what a trauma all this has been for me. I mean, my identity was so bound up with my intelligence. Look, I know it's good copy and so on but I just can't.” She might help others in her position. “I'm sorry.” WILLIAM MILLER The only young Ph.D.'s in the humanities who are not getting hurt these days, it seems, are either the very lucky or the very shrewd, and William S. Miller, 37, of Berkeley, Calif., must count among the latter. He has a background similar to that of Dennis Grimes: Bay Shore High and Harpur College. There the similarities stop. Bill Miller's father is a biologist who, when Bill was growing up, worked for the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. By the time he was in high school, Bill considered “learning,” as he says, his world: “I was sure I'd end up spending my life in some university. I was always an excellent student in high school and college, and as a graduate student, it's fair to say I was very good” According to Prof. Thomas Flanagan, who was chairman of the English Department at Berkeley when Bill was a graduate student there, Miller was the top student in his field. His special area was the Renaissance. But, except for teaching assistantships and lectureships at Berkeley, Bill has never held an academic job. Nor has he sought one. By the time he was ready for the job market, he also held a California real‐estate license. Today he is a successful broker with Hamilton Realty Company in Berkeley. He lives in a small but attractive white house beside a stream, surrounded by big cedar trees. Books and classical statues recall his academic past, but as he talked about himself on a Saturday morning, clients rang him on the phone every few minutes. Many of them are his former professors. He was pleased that just last week he had sold a house for $96,000. Four years earlier, the seller had given him an A in a seminar. “I used to be heavily into what was called the development of the Western mind,” Bill says. He is a slight, trim, good‐looking man with a low voice. He loves to talk and the sentences roll out with Ciceronian elegance. His dissertation was “The Cultural Context of the Mythography of Milton's ‘Comas.’ “ “I knew there were jobs for me then. I also knew they were all revolving doors. I saw friends take horrible jobs in Godforsaken places, abysmally horrible, and did they ever have to scramble and kowtow. I knew I was good but no better than thousands of others. I was also very sick of being poor and I decided that other kinds of hustle could be more personally and financially rewarding.” At first Bill found it difficult to give up the idea of an academic career. By the time he was a sophomore at Namur, he had decided that “literature was the most complex and vibrant thing I could dedicate my life to. Literature, I thought, is what it means to be human. I admired and emulated the Harpur faculty, their ability to elucidate things otherwise arcane. “I also developed an elitist, snobbish attitude that's typical of academics. The college was on a hill, and down there was Binghamton. We were thinking about Augustine while the local slobs were sinking into the pits of financial and artistic decrepitude.” Bill stayed on at Harpur for his M.A. in 1966, and while he thinks it was a fine education, he says he “didn't know diddly about anything past the 16th century. I hadn't even read ‘Catcher in the Rye.’ “ But contemporary life closed in, led by his draft board. At that point, Bill's shrewdness paid off for the first time. “I considered Saigon. Morally and physically, it seemed a poor choice.” Careful research unearthed Robert College in Istanbul, which at the time was funded in part by the United States Government. American teachers at Robert (and other American colleges in the Middle East and Africa) had been declared to be working “in the national interest” and therefore draftexempt. After two years teaching Shakespeare to the Turks, Bill was 26 and draftsafe. He entered Berkeley as a Ph.D. student. “By the time I got my doctorate, I could see how grim things were. I was pretty terrified for a while, but one day I sat down and decided what I wanted: money, free time, and to live in Berkeley. Next to literature, I love houses, so real estate was the obvious choice.” To put pressure on himself, he told his student friends he was going for a real‐estate Iicerise. “They were appalled. How could I demean myself? Alarm! disbelief! Yuit‐yuk!” He enrolled in a class sponsored by the local board of realtors and immediately realized that his scholarly training and test‐taking experience were great advantages. He got his license even before the class had finished. “I discovered that Renaissance studies have affinities with the Byzantine complexities of California real‐estate law, which is a complicated and confused mixture of Anglo‐Saxon practice and vestigial Spanish intrigue.” By the time Bill's contract as a lecturer at Berkeley ran out, he had a comfortable income which was growing day by day. After his first transaction, he thought, • •My God! An epiphany. I can be many different things! Here I am the furthest thing possible from the manifest dignity of a professor — and it's a terrific liberation. Making money is wonderful.” He also took pleasure in confounding his former colleagues and teachers, who were now coming to him for advice. “I discovered,” Bill reflects, “that the real world of capitalism isn't universally loathsome. I've seen all sides, including the polyester suits and pinkie rings. But a skilled, ethical, gentlemanly businessman is a valuable and rare thing to be.” Bill is reluctant to divulge his current income, but he admitted that he is making much more than the $15,000 to $16,000 that he could get today as an assistant professor, if he could find an academic job at all. He would like to help graduate students in trouble and has a wide correspondence with former students who ask him for advice. What does he tell he a. them? “I say ask yourself what you really like to do besides teach. Cook? Great. Open a restaurant.” He has proposed to the Berkeley English Department that he and other ex‐academics meet with students to advise them of their options and to buck them up. So far, the department has not followed through on the idea. “They have this tremendous guilt,” Bill suggests. “They feel responsible, but they don't like to face it, so they feel helpless. I also tried to get them to put a warning on the application forms, ‘This course of study may not lead to employment.’ “ He was anxious not to be too critical of the tenured faculty, but finally he did blurt out, “I think it's a fraud and a deceit to swell the ranks of graduate students just so that chairs can be kept open for faculty.” ■"
Abortion Aid Curb Weighed in Albany,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/19/archives/abortion-aid-curb-weighed-in-albany-restrictions-are-weighed-candid.html,"ALBANY, March 18—Legislative leaders and Governor Carey are seeking to resolve a seemingly inevitable deadlock over the emotional issue of public financing of abortions. Special to The New York Times With two weeks to the deadline for a budget, the solution to the question of whether the state should continue to pay for abortions under the Medicaid program remains elusive. But one active strategy calls for an amendment restricting state payment to cases involving rape, incest or damage to the physical health of the mother, according to executive and legislative aides. This would be similar to the so‐called Hyde Amendment, which became Federal law after a bitter battle in Congress last year. The problem is that a majority of the Republican‐led State Senate favors a virtual cutoff of the money for abortions. while a majority of the Democratic‐led Assembly favors retaining all or most of it. New York State, with its localities, pays for more than 50,000 Medicaid abortions a year at a cost of about $16 miilion, and it is one of only a handful of states that do so. Restrictions Are Weighed While there are not enough votes in the Democratic‐led Assembly to cut off the funds, as was attempted unsuccessfully last year, legislative aides say there could be enough to approve a less restrictive amendment - but only if it were taken up separately from the budget. The new Assembly Speaker, Stanley Fink, has pledged not to allow the budget to be amended directly in his house, and is expected to do everything within his power to fulfill that pledge. In a clear indication of the gravity of the problem, Robert J. Morgado, Secretary to Governor Carey, quietly held an unusual hourlong meeting on Friday with Senator James H. Donovan, who led the Senate's anti‐abortion bloc in a maneuver that left the state without a budget for almost a week last year. Senator Donovan, a Republican‐Conservative from Chadwicks, eventually yielded last year after getting legislators’ positions on abortion clearly on the record, for consideration before the election, but he failed to get any restrictions on state financing of abortions. Buoyed by the surprising success of the Right‐to‐Life Party in last November's elections, Mr. Donovan has promised that he wilt not give in as easily this year. But after his meeting with Mr. Morgado on Friday, he was cautious about just how far he intended to go. ‘Candid’ Discussions Held “The discussions we had were very candid on both sides, and we're going to attempt to see where we can go from here,” Mr. Donovan said. He said he expetted more meetings next week, possibly with the legislative leaders and the Governor. Neither side would elaborate on the content of Friday's meeting, but it was suggested that they had discussed a plan involving eventual passage of an amendment similar to the Hyde restrictions. There was no indication whether Speaker Fink would permit the consideration of a Hyde amendment and whether Governor Carey would approve it. Mr. Donovan, while saying he could neither confirm nor deny that this specific scenario was being discussed, said that Mr. Morgado had told him that “there are certain limitations at this point in time beyond which he cannot commit anybody.” He was apparently referring to the Governor and the Speaker. The adoption of a Hyde type of amendment would drastically reduce the abortions the state would finance but would likely allow local governents to pay for them on their own. Mr. Fink said today that he and his staff were “in the midst of working on a Strategy to solve this problem.” He would not discuss it, but he said that the Hyde Amendment is not a paramount part of the strategy.” Fink for Abortion Finaneine “I don't buy that the Hyde Amendment is a compromise position,” Mr. Fink said, “but that's my personal view.” Mr. Fink, who last year was majority leader, is a strong advocate of state financing for abortions. His successor, Daniel B. Walsh, Democrat of Franklinville, voted last year to cut off the funds. Mr. Walsh, the first Democrat to be elected to the Assembly from his district in decades, is part of a Right‐to‐Life “hit list” of legislators whose performance: are being carefully watched. There is no clear indication what Gov. ernor Carey would do if he were asked tc sign a bill similar to the Hyde Amendment or if restrictive language were attached to the budget. Mr. Carey's position has been that sc long as the Supreme Court has ruled abortion is legal, it is the state's obligation to make it available to poor women as well as rich women. And the Assembly leadership decided last year to force a vote on the issue on the Assembly floor only after receiving private assurances from the Governor that he would veto a restriction on abortion funds. One aide said that if a restrictive bill went to the Governor's desk, “the pressure would be enormous” for him to sign it, but the aide acknowledged that such pressure would be less enormous than last year, when the Governor was facing a tough re‐election fight. The right‐to‐life groups have held that the only way to get the abortion money restricted is to make it part of the budget. Mr. Carey maintained in a news conference last week that under his “line‐item veto” power, he could strike any restrictive language that was inserted in the budget. And he said he would go to court to defend that right, if necessary."
Sages And/or Scientists?,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/19/archives/sages-andor-scientists.html,"MANTIC. Conn. — During the 1950's and 1960's, it was the fashion among moral philosophers to spend much of their time demonstrating by “rigorous” argument that moral terms such as “good” and “bad,” “right” and “wrong,” and “ought” and “ought not” simply express irrational bursts of feeling, having no more significance than “Yummie!” and “Ugh!” This, we were told, was the final word on moral values, an area of human concern that philosophers have always claimed to be under their exclusive intellectual jurisdiction. Now this silly season appears to be over, and moral philosphers have set up shop again, even applying their reasoning skills to such contemporary moral issues as abortion, affirmative action, euthanasia, sexuality, aggression and civil disobedience. But they are seemingly unaware that during their lengthy defection social scientists have been poaching on their jealously guarded territory. In the past, most social scientists have eschewed the study of moral values, in part because of the hoary philosophic maxim that good and bad, right and wrong, and ought and ought not are derived by intuition and reasoning and are not a subject for descriptive investigation, and in part because values were not conceived as “objective facts” approachable by the scientific method. But this is no longer the case. Over the last decade, a vast literaure detailing scientific studies of values and valuing has been accumulating‐in the journals of such diverse disciplines as psychology, sociology, neurophysiology, ethology, anthropology, economics and political science. Scientists have been reporting, for example, that such moral‐value terms are used throughout the world's languages, that the degree of such values as goodness, happiness, fairness and justice can be scaled and measured as easily and reliably as degrees of brightness and loudness, that rudimentary signs of approval and disapproval are seen in infants shortly after birth, that rigid power hierarchies are formed in groups of pre‐school children, and that a certain drug blocks the rewarding qualities of situations. Fair‐sampling national and international surveys of judged well‐being, freedom, justice and a host of other moral values have yielded results that are replicable by others, meeting the scientific criterion of reliability. The question therefore can legitimately be asked whether the judgment of one moral philosopher of, say, the fairness of a given situation is as reliable as the judgments derived from the life experiences of hundreds of nonphilosophers. Moral valuing itself, the way we make our significant choices and reach our moral judgments, has proved open to scientific investigations that have already revealed some of its processes as well as its all‐toofrequent weaknesses. Judgments are prey to compulsions to conform to our peers and to adhere to social norms. Judgments are influenced by emotion, prejudice, rationalization in all its forms, challenges to self‐esteem, and common errors in estimating probabilities. Social scientists are sensitized to these weaknesses in their own judgments and strive to avoid them, especially in their studies of morals. But what of moral philosophers trained to depend simply on the select view, from the ivory towers, of their own skulls, their self‐evident intuitions, and rigorous arguments? Shouldn't those who are trying to deal with the highly complex and emotion‐provoking moral issues of the day be guided in their arguments by the multiple errors to which moral judgments, including their own, are subject? It is very doubtful that moralists working largely from their own armchairs, relying solely on intuition and reasoning, without knowledge of what has been scientifically determined about human valuing, can offer us trustworthy advice on moral issues. If philosophers remain unfamiliar with the accumulated scientific knowledge about the factors that have created contemporary moral problems and the consequences of the proposed solutions, their reasoning and intuition are operating in a very large vacuum. So far, philosophers, like Galileo's colleagues, have refused to “look into the telescope.” Isn't it time for them to stop their jurisdictional squabbling. look at what the scientists have found out, and contribute their sorely needed training in logical analysis to an inter. disciplinary attack on the moral dilemmas that beset us?

CLINIC CALLED FRONT FOR ABORTION FOES.,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/20/archives/clinic-called-front-for-abortion-foes-philadelphia-woman-says.html,"PHILADELPHIA, March 19 — The emotional debate that the question of abortion almost inevitably provokes has taken a new twist here with the filing today of administrative and legal action against a clinic in Northeast Philadelphia. Lawyers for a women's health group and a patient at the clinic charge that the clinic is really a front for an organization opposed to abortions. Special to The New York Times The clinic is called the Abortion, Birth Control and Pregnancy Testing Clinic. The women's health group, Choice, and the Women's Law Project filed a cornplaint with the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission, asking it to order Bell Telephone of Pennsylvania to remove the clinic's listing from the Philadelphia White Pages on the ground that the listing’ was misleading. The complaint stems from a lawsuit filed last July on behalf of a Philadelphia! woman, Donna Bonacci, against the clinic, an anti‐abortion group called SOUL, an acronym for Save Our Unborn Lives, and its president, Jeannette C. Neary. The suit contends that Mrs. Neary, a registered nurse and the mother of five children, runs the clinic, SOUL and an organization called the Women's, Health Advocacy Group from her home. Both groups and the clinic have separate but identical addresses and telephone listings in the city directory. Mrs. Neary's address and phone number are unlisted. Miss Bonacci was 18 years old and living with her parents in April 1977 when she called the clinic to discuss a potential abortion. She contended in her lawsuit that, although she had asked that her call remain confidential, two women associ‐i ated with the clinic visited her on the night she placed the call, and that her father beat her when he learned that she wanted an abortion. Obtained Abortion Elsewhere She eventually obtained an abortion elsewhere, she said, but temporarily gave up her job and was still estranged from her father. Miss Bonacci's lawsuit accuses the clinic, SOUL and Mrs. Neary of violating her privacy and breaking state trade and consumer protection laws. Because the case is still pending in Philadelphia Common Pleas Court, Mrs. Neary's attorney, Mary Alice Duffy, said she would not permit her client to comment on the lawsuit, but described the clinic as a place where women received abortion counseling, pregnancy testing and doctors’ referrals without charge. As for whether Mrs. Neary misrepresents the clinic, Miss Duffy said, “It's a matter of speech — most abortion clinics are listed as health centers.” Two women who joined in today's complaint charged that they had received strongly worded anti‐abortion literature in the mail from the clinic or the women's health advocacy group, and said the clinic's and health group's phones were answered by a recorded message counseling against abortion. New Abortion Law in Nebraska LINCOLN, Neb., March 19 (AP) — The Nebraska Legislature gave final approval today to a new abortion statute requiring women to wait 48 hours after asking for an abortion and girls under the age of 18 to consult with their parents or guardians. The measure now goes to Gov. Charles Thom, who has said he will sign the bill into law. The 37‐to‐4 vote capped three months of debate over the constitutionality of portions of the bill, which itself was introduced to bypass constitutional problems in a previous abortion law. If the new bill becomes law, it will require the following: ¶Wotnen to wait two full days for an abortion after asking a physician to perform one. ¶Women to give their written consent for an abortion after receiving information concerning the consequences of pregnancy, adoption and abortion. ¶Doctors to discuss the availability of agencies and services to assist a woman in carrying her pregnancy to full term. ¶Girls under 18 to consult with parents or guardians and provide doctors with a written statement indicating they did so before having abortions. The bill sets a misdemeanor penalty for a doctor who performs an abortion if the physician “knew or should have known that the woman was under 18 or not married.”"
Clinic to Provide Sterilization Using Simpler Technique,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/20/archives/clinic-to-provide-sterilization-using-simpler-technique-the-cost.html,"A relatively inexpensive, safe and quick method for sterilization developed over the last 20 years in the Far East will be available to women in an out‐of‐hospital setting in May at Planned Parenthood of New York City, it was announced yesterday. Alfred F. Moran, executive vice president of the organization, which specializes in reproductive health care, said that the use of the mini‐laparotomy procedure would make the Margaret Sanger Center at 380 Second Avenue the only state‐licensed nonhospital setting in the state where female. sterilization is available. Mr. Moran said he thought the new procedure, known as mini‐lap, would interest a large number of women, particularly those over 30 who have completed their childbearing. Eligibility would be based on the results of a medical and psychological evaluation. The Cost Will Be $350 Mr. Moran said that at present female sterilization tended to be both expensive and inconvenient. “Hospitals generally require patients to stay two or three days, sometimes up to five,” he said, “making the operation cost up to $1,000 or more. The cost of the minilap at the clinic here would be $350, which includes evaluation and counseling, the surgery itself, postoperative visits and all lab tests.” Dr. Enayat Hakim‐Elahi, the center's medical director, said that the surgical technique was a refinement of the standard laparotomy, or tubal ligation, which requires a general anesthetic and a hospital setting. He said that only a local anesthetic was necessary for the mini‐lap. The development of a surgical‐tool called an elevator permits lifting the uterus wall, enabling the physician to see the Fallopian tubes through a very small incision. The tubes are gently exposed and tied into a loop and a section is clipped out. The tubes are then returned to the body cavity. He said the mini‐lap procedure takes less than 30 minutes and the patient is able to return home that afternoon. “In addition to the dramatic reduction in cost and the easy accessibility of this procedure,” Mr. Moran continued, “there is another reason why we think offering this service is a major step forward. • Entirely Voluntary “Frequently sterilizations have been done in association with childbirth,” he continued, referring to the practice in some hospitals to propose to a woman almost immediately following delivery that she have a tubal ligation. “This raises the question of coercion and sterilization abuse,” Mr. Moran said. “The opening of our clinic will remove that issue entirely. A woman comes here voluntarily. We will discuss the question fully with her, help her to understand that it is practically irreversible, and discuss whether or not she would prefer it in a freestanding or hospital setting.” Mr. Moran said that Planned Parenthood viewed the establishment of “freestanding” sterilization services as a contribution toward solving some of the problems the organizaton feels are facing hospitals today. “Moving birth control procedures out of hospitals to lower‐cost facilities should help conserve hospital beds and resources for more sophisticated procedures,” he said. Planned Parenthood administrators had noted that 1.1 million sterilizations were performed in 1977, the most recent year (or which statistics are available. The decision by Planned Parenthood New York to offer female sterilization in an outpatient setting was criticized by Dr. Robert S. Neuwirth of St. Luke's Hospital. “I don't think it is appropriate in New York City,” said Dr. Neuwirth, who is considered an expert in another female sterilization procedure called laparoscopy. “In the first place, I'm not aware of a long waiting line. I can see using the mini‐lap in the outlands of Bangkok or in Seoul, Korea, where the risk of pregnancy might be greater than the risk of mini‐lap in an ambulatory setting. But not when there are the special resources available here in New York City.” The laparoscopy technique that Dr. Neuwirth prefers involves the inflation of the abdomen with carbon dioxide, the insertion of a laparoscopy in the inflated cavity, and the cauterization of the Fallopian tubes. Although the procedure, like the mini‐lap, is swift (15 to 20 minutes) and can also be done on an outpatient basis, it requires great technical skill on the part of the physician because of the risk of burning or perforating adjacent organs. In Dr. Neuwirth's view, the issue was not that the mini‐lap offered by Planned Parenthood was more risky than the laparoscOpy. Rather, it was a matter of bringing any surgical procedure, he said, into “an operating room situation so that if anything happens you can deal with it.” However, Planned Parenthood officials have stressed that the new pro.. gram has been approved by the New York State Health Department and that the basic team of five used in many hospital operating rooms would perform the mini‐lap operation. In addition to the surgeon, there would be an anesthesiologist, a scrub nurse, a circulating nurse and a doctor's assistant. Planned Parenthood also said that the center had an arrangement with New York Hospital as its backup facility and would keep an ambulance ready at all times, even though complications are regarded as very rare with this technique. Dr. Jefferson Penfield, a physician in Syracuse who has helped to pioneer the mini‐lap in this country, said of the plans for the outpatient serice: “The mini‐lap technique is safer and easier to perform than the laparoscopy, there's no question about it. It is also less expensive to set up, with less expensive equipment. “The mini‐lap has been used for 20 years,” Dr. Penfield continued, “mostly in Japan, Thailand and India and the last five to 10 years in Central America. But it's been popular here only the last few ymrs because we gynecologists have been so fascinated with the more sophisticated laparoscoPY‐” Dr. Penfield, who performs both mini‐laps and laparoscopies in his office, with a hospital facility two minutes away, mentioned several circumstances under which he would not use the mini‐lap procedure: “If the patient were obese; if the uterus could not be manually detected; if the uterus were englazed with fibrosides, or if there were any suspected disease of either ovary or tubes. These patients,” he said, “are better done with laparoscopy.” Determining Eligibility The Planned Parenthood program, according to Mr. Moran and Dr. flatam‐Elahi, will include medical and psycholgical evaluation for each candidate. Medical conditions that might make some women ineligible for the mini‐lap operation in the freestanding clinic would includi, allergies to anesthesia, diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, previous abdominal or pelvic surgery or recent childbirth or abortion. “Careful patient screening and counseling is key,” Mr. Moran said. “If a woman is not a geAxi candidate for outof‐hospital service, we will refer her to a hospital‐based program or encourage her to use other methods of contraception.” For information about the mini‐lap service or sterilization in general, Planned Parenthood gave this number to call: 677‐3040."

Westchester Panel Reports on Airport WHITE PLAINS (UPI) — The Westchester County Airport Advisory Board said yesterday that it opposed any physical expansion of the airport, but urged the county's Board of Legislators to remove limits on the number of commercial flights and the distances they may travel. In a 21‐page report the board also said a second airport would be required to meet the needs of a growing number of private‐airplane users in Westchester and urged a study of suitable sites. Suggestions that a second airport be built in Croton‐on‐Hudson have been opposed by many residents. The advisory board also said none of the runways — including any new landing strips — should be increased in length. This would assure that larger jets, including the Concorde SST, could never land in Westchester. The county currently allows 20 commercial and commuter flights in and out of the airport — the state's fourth largest — each day, but restricts the flights to no more than 600 miles, eliminating the possibility of flights to Chicago or Atlanta.

(UPI) - Dr. Anton Notey, a 70‐year‐old owner of two hospitals and three nursing homes on Long Island, was sentenced to up to four years in prison and fined $369,000 for stealing approximately $1.6 million in state Medicaid and Blue Cross funds. The jail term was ordered by Judge Melvin Tanenbaurm of Suffolk County Court despite pleas by Dr. Notey's lawyers that the elderly physician was in poor health. The Hungarian‐born Dr. Notey, who lives in Merrick, L.I., was given until Sept. 12 to pay the fine. As part of a plea‐bargaining arrange. ment last August, Dr. Notey agreed to pay $1.25 million in restitution to the state and Blue Cross. In August, he made a $500,000 payment, and a similar payment was made to the court on Monday before he was sentenced."

Rights Plan Foes Celebrate Its Difficulties With a Gala,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/23/archives/rights-plan-foes-celebrate-its-difficulties-with-a-gala-award-for.html,"WASHINGTON, March 22 — With a gala party, musical skits and a blitz of antifeminist pronouncements, opponents of the equal rights amendment marshaled forces here today to celebrate the expiration of the original seven‐year ratification period, to declare the measure moribund and to lampoon its supporters in song. satire and stinging sarcasm. Put somewhat on the defensive by the day's goings‐on, supporters of the measure called a news conference to say that the E.R.A. death notices were premature and that their struggle, though uphill, was far from over, having been given a 3½‐year reprieve by Congress last year. It was a day of hyperbole and high emotion — standard ingredients in the E.R.A. battle — as the original deadline for ratification of the amendment by the states passed and both sides reaffirmed commitments to fights for and against the measure in the coming ratification extension period, due to expire on June 30, 1982. The amendment has been approved by 35 of the required 38 states, but its future remains uncertain. Five states have sought to rescind their approval, recent E.R.A. campaigns in four other states have failed and the measure's opponents contend they are riding tide of discontent that will ultimately kill the amendment. And while supporters are mapping major efforts to recover lost momentum, E.R.A. foes were riding high in the capital today, gleefully writing the amendment's obituary at a news conference and staging a mock wake at an evening cocktail party and dinner at the Shoreham‐Americana Hotel attended by 1,100 people. “The E.R.A. dies tonight, morally and constitutionally,” declared Phyllis Schlafly, an Illinois housewife and mother of six children who is chairman of Stop E.R.A. and has become a na tional figure fighting the amendment. Mrs. Schlafly, ebullient in a red silk suit, bubbled with enthusiasm as she discussed the evening's “pro‐life gala,”billed as “The E.R.A. Follies of 1979.” Popping champagne corks, musical parodies, skits lampooning E.R.A. supporters and a brief bomb scare enlived the party, attended by prominent political conservatives, including Senators Orrin Hatch aryl Jake Garn, Republicans of Utah, Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, and Representative George Hansen, Republican of Idaho. They were greeted at the hotel's ballroom by a large floralwreath display of yellow and white chrysanthemums with a black sash proclaiming: “Rest in Peace E.R.A.” After an anonymous male caller told the hotel management that two bombs would go off at the banquet, the guests were evacuated from 9 to 9:30 P.M., but the party then resumed without in cident and the only injuries were the supposedly bruised egos of the targets of the satire that unfolded. Most of the lyrics were written by Mrs. Schlafly. To the tune of “Old Fashioned Girl,” the crowd was treated to a rendition of, “I want a person, just like the person that married dear old parent.” Another song on the program was a duet from “Auntie Marne” by two women portraying former Representative Bella S. Abzug and Gloria Steinem, the feminist. “Who's goin' open the door?” sings one. “No one,” the other replies. “Who's goin' pay our alimony?” “No one.” Another spoof directed against Mrs. Abzug was called “I've grown tired of Bella's Face,” and had an actor portraying President Carter singing: “Dealing with Sadat and Begin was not easy, yet I could no longer take her chats, no longer stand her hats, I made her take a walk.” Some of the barbs were heavy with sarcasm. Sarah Weddington, a White House assistant, was described as a “number one abortion proponent and a supporter of killing babies,” while Mrs. Abzug's work at the International Year of the Woman Conference last year was said to be “pro‐abortion, pro‐E.R.A., pro‐lesbian.” The follies got a standing ovation from the audience. Award for Husband Senator Garn received an award for his support of the Stop E.R.A. movement, and in his acceptance remarks, took the occasion to criticize the proposed treaty limiting strategic arms, saying he would, “do everything I can to see that the treaty is not ratified.” Mrs. Schlafly's husband was also given an award a for being “her coach, lover and cheerleader.” Earlier in the day, representatives of 150 organizations supporting the E.R.A. met to recommit themselves to their struggle. At a news conference, many declared that the amendment was still alive and would ultimately become law. “We are winning the battle,” Eleanor Smeal, the president of the National Organization for Women, asserted. “Those political leaders, those political analysts, business leaders and odds makers who wager that a hard core minority of right‐wingers can keep down forever a surging majority of women and men who know they are equal, do so at their own peril.” “The Equal Rights Amendment will not go away — we will not go away,” said Helen Milliken, co‐chairman of the advocacy group called ERAmerica and the wife of Michigan Governor William G. Milliken. Other supporters of the amendment said they would work to elect more pro‐E.R.A. legislators in the state legislatures. A Strong Start The E.R.A., which would outlaw discrimination on the basis of sex, cleared Congress on March 22, 1972, together with a resolution saying it would become part of the United States Constitution if approved by 38 states within seven years. The amendment started out strong, with 22 states voting ratification in the first year and 30 had done so by the end of 1973. But the proposal bogged down as traditionalists counter‐attacked, arguing that approval could mean drafting women for combat service and suggesting that women would be obliged to give up alimony and use the same rest rooms as men. In 1979, only three states ratified, only one in 1975 and none in 1976. The last state to ratify was Indiana in 1977. Since then, E.R.A. has been stopped, with recent defeats in Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina, Virginia and, just last week, in Arkansas. Congress last year extended the ratification deadline to 1982, but the extension has not been viewed as a certain reprieve for the E.R.A. In South Dakota, Idaho, Nebraska, Tennessee and Kentucky, legislatures have voted to rescind earlier approval votes, though court struggles are expected over the validity of these actions."
The Region,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/23/archives/the-region-police-investigating-jersey-girls-death.html,"PATERSON, N.J. (UPI) — The police have been questioning relatives and friends of a 9‐year‐old girl, whose partly nude and battered body was found buried under debris on a deserted street about a block from her house. The girl, Latrelle Jones of 59 Paterson Avenue, had been missing since Saturday, and was found beaten to death Wednesday. An autopsy determined she had been raped and the cause of death was found to be multiple skull fractures and a brain hemorrhage. The police said she had been reported missing by her mother after she failed to return home from a visit to her father. The parents are separated. The mother, Violet Jones, told the police her daughter was being watched by an uncle Saturday morning when she decided to visit her father, who lives about eight blocks away. According to the police, neighbors of the father, Frank Scharpe, saw the child knock on his front door, but told her he was not at home, and that was the last time she was seen alive. Ruling on Autopsy WHITE PLAINS — In a written decision released here, a State Supreme Court Justice ruled that to permit an autopsy on an Orthodox Jew who died a week after being hit by an automobile would violate her rights to freedom of religion and those of her family. The decision by Justice Anthony Ferraro followed an oral ruling on March 13 that prevented the Westchester County medical examiner from performing an autopsy on 78‐year‐old Dolly Atkins of Hartsdale, whose family argued that autopsies were forbidden by the tenets of Orthodox Judaism. Abortion Bill Cleared By Panel in Hartford HARTFORD — By a 12‐to‐5 vote, the Connecticut legislature's Public Health and Safety Committee approved a bill to require parental consent on abortions for minors. Several consitutional questions have been raised about the bill, which is now headed for review by the Judiciary Committee. The bill provides women under 18 years of age the opportunity to obtain a court order for the abortion if parental consent is denied. The health committee rejected a bill requiring a pregnant woman to give “informed” written consent before obtaining an abortion. Another abortion bill awaiting committee action would provide state financing of abortions for welfare recipientc College Board Study EDISON, N.J.— A special state commission studying the operations of the county college system has recommended that all elected public officials be barred from any direct involvement in the operations of the 17 two‐year schools. However, the commission strongly recommended the wider involvement of the state in the operations of the colleges through increased financial support and through the appointment of two members to each of the nine‐member boards of trustees at the county colleges. Indictments Made In Jersey Drug Ring TOMS RIVER, N.J. (UPI) — The Ocean County Prosecutor's Office announced the indictments of an alleged 10‐member drug‐smuggling ring on charges the group landed millions of dollars of marijuana on the New Jersey coast over the past two years. The indictments alleged the ring transported the marijuana from Colombia on large ships and then unloaded it into smaller, high‐speed crafts that landed in New Jersey coves and bays. The drugs were stored in “stash houses” for packaging and ship. ment later throughout the state. After a lengthy investigation, county and Federal authorities seized all the ships and vans along with $80,000 in cash. Still listed as fugitives were Fred S. Fillingham, 25, of Monmouth County; Ronnie Ray Honorio, 30, and Carol Amend, 35, both of California. Others named in the indictments were Dennis Lengyel, 32, of Carteret, N.J.; Patrick Tony Lee, 24; Stephanie Lynn Stephens, 24; Ellen Leyrer, 24; Gary Foisy, 32, and David Phillip Watts, 27, all of Florida, and Julian Honorio, 38, of California."
Albany Compromise on School Aid And Revenue Sharing Falls Apart,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/23/archives/albany-compromise-on-school-aid-and-revenue-sharing-falls-apart.html,"ALBANY, March 22 — Negotiators for the Legislature and Governor Carey reached and then lost an agreement today to hold down increases in education aid in return for a new state revenuesharing formula. The new formula would have given local governments almost as much state aid as they had expected for this year, but would have slowed the growth of local aid in the future. Hours after the agreement was made, it fell apart during a raucous meeting at which Republican Senators demanded adjustments in the education‐aid formula. The adjustments would have required more money than was called for in the agreement. The collapse of the agreement left negotiators stunned and turning. It left the Senate, Assembly and the Governor's office with different views over how to proceed. Assembly negotiators, according to persons familiar with the discussions, said they believed that there was enough money in the budget for two aims: to restore about $80 million of the $87 million in revenue‐sharing aid that localities would have lost under Mr. Carey's plan and to increase state education aid by about $170 million over last year's levels. This would have guaranteed that no school district would have lost any money and provide for modest increases in some areas. Budget Shortfall Feared But Senate Republican leaders and Governor Carey's aides — fearing a budget shortfall next year — argued that the state could afford a revenue‐sharing increase only if it held down the education‐aid increase to $131 million. This limitation, however, proved unacceptable to rank‐and‐file Republican Senators, who were unwilling to accept the reductions in aid to their school districts. Some Republicans reportedly proposed that money be shifted from revenue sharing back to school aid. Persons familiar with the discussions also suggested that the move by the Senate and the Governor's office might be part of a strategy to revive some of the tax cuts that had been pronounced dead earlier this week. The pronouncement was made by aides to Senate leaders, aides of the Governor, Assemblyman Arthur J. Kremer, the Long Beach Democrat who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and Senator John J. Marchi, a Staten Island Republican who is chairman of the Finance Committee. The strategy, these analysts said, might involve winnowing down both the school aid and the revenue‐sharing packages enough to free a limited amount of money for tax reductions. Opinions on Strategy Meanwhile, a difference in opinion over strategy emerged today between Mr. Carey and the Speaker of the Assembly, Stanley Fink of Brooklyn, on the thorny issue of using Medicaid funds to pay for abortions for the poor. Both Mr. Carey and Mr. Fink strongly oppose efforts led by Senator James H. Donovan, Republican‐Conservative of Chadwicks, to cut off Medicaid abortion financing. Carey aides have been developing a strategy that involved passage of a limited cutoff of funds by both houses of the Legislature, which the Governor would presumably veto. Mr. Carey has not committed himself publicly on this issue, but in the past, he has said that he would not permit a restriction of funds for Medicaid abortions. However, Mr. Fink is apparently unwilling to accept the passage of any measure by the Assembly that would eliminate abortion assistance. A top aide to Mr. Fink said today that the issue was not only Mr. Fink's personal opposition to the abortion‐financing cutoff, but also opposition among Mr. Fink's colleagues to a reduction in aid. The aide said there were not enough votes in .the Assembly to pass any antiabortion amendment, although other vote‐counters have asserted that limited anti‐abortion measures have enough votes to pass. As a result of the impasse, both men have agreed to wait and see what strategy is developed by abortion opponents. The difficulties encountered by both sides in reaching a compromise on the emotional abortion issue suggest that there may be a replay of last year's battle, which left New York State without a budget for almost a week. Vacation Plans Canceled I know a lot of people who have canceled vacation plans around this place,” a top aide to Mr. Fink said, referring to the two‐week recess that is scheduled to follow the passage of the budget at the end of the month. Mr. Carey had proposed an educationaid increase of $206 million, but his plan would have hurt wealthy and politically influential districts, with Nassau and Westchester Counties bearing the brunt of the cuts."
The Region,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/24/archives/the-region-police-protection-for-victory-gardens.html,"MORRISTOWN, N.J. — Police services will continue in Victory Gardens, according to Morris County's Prosecutor, Peter Manahan, even if that tiny borough is forced to dismiss all municipal workers April 1 because voters have rejected any higher taxes to pay for a $50,812 budget deficit. Mr. Manahan said he would ask the State Attorney General to have the state police cover the borough. A morecomplicated alternative would be a “review of potential court action to compel Victory Gardens to fund an adequate police department.” He added that it would mean convincing court to act “because it never would have been done before.” The 9I‐acre community has been operating on a temporary budget since Jan. 1. Judge Orders Trial In Nurse's Transfer HACKENSACK, N.J. — A Superior Court judge here has ruled that a trial will have to decide whether a hospital violated the civil rights of a nurse who was transferred to a medical‐surgical ward at Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, N.J., after she refused to help perform abortions in the hospital's maternity unit. The judge, Sherwin Lester, said he could not decide the case “on first impressions” without calling witnesses. No trial date was scheduled. The nurse, Beverly Jeczalik, 30 years old of Hawthorne, N.J., who works part‐time at the hospital, had asked the judge to order her to be reinstated to the maternity ward under the state's abortion law, which protects hospital workers who refuse to perform or assist in the surgical procedure. Psychiatrist Asks Dismissal of Suit HACKENSACK, N.J. — A Teaneck, N.J., psychiatrist, Dr. Michael M. Milano, has asked a judge to dismiss a negligence suit that charges that he should have warned a young woman that a patient wanted to kill her. The young woman, Kimberly McIntosh, 22 years old, of Teaneck was shot to death in July 1975, just hours after the patient left a session with Dr. Milano. The pyschiatrist's lawyer, Robert McKenna, argued Friday that Miss McIntosh, a model, and her parents knew about the threats made by their next‐door neighbor, Lee Morgenstein, who was 17 at the time. He said the suit brought by the girl's mother should be dismissed because Dr. Milano would have violated the confidential doctorpatient relationship if he had warned the family or authorities of the threats. Superior Court Judge James J. Petreloa reserved decision, noting that no law in New Jersey covers such a suit. Mr. Morgenstein, now 20, was found guilty of first‐degree murder in 1976, but his conviction was overturned by an appeals court for prosecutorial misconduct during the Bergen County trial. Mr. Morgenstein is still in prison while the case is appealed to the state Supreme Court. Police Seek Killer Of Paterson Girl PATERSON, N.J. — Authorities are continuing their search for an assailant who raped and murdered a 9‐year‐old girl, Latrelle Jones, after she left home here last Saturday. The child's body was found Wednesday by firefighters extinguishing a rubbish fire. Authorities said the girl had been sexually assaulted and beaten with a blunt instrument sometime between 4 P.M. Tuesday and when she was found. Police say they have no suspects and few clues. The police said she ran away after an argument and that for the final four days of her life, the child lived as a street urchin. But her mother, Violet Jones, denies there was an argument or thavhe girl was unhappy the day she disappeared. Mrs. Jones, who has five other children, says that on Saturday she left her children in the care of an uncle. She said the uncle told her Latrelle had received a phone call to come visit her father, Frank Scharpe, who lives about eight blocks away. Mr. Scharpe told a reporter that he saw the girl, gave her some spending money and sent her home. State Weighs Bill On Bullet Vests Legislation that would require the state to pay the cost of providing bulletproof vests to line police officers has been introduced in the State Senate by Senator Norman J. Levy, Republican of Merrick, L.I., and Senator John J. Marchi, Republican of Staten Island. Developed in conjunction with the Metropolitan Police Conference, the bill provides that localities will be reimbursed for providing the vests to their police officers. Senator Levy estimated the cost to the state at $3.5 million over two years, with $1.75 million in the 1979‐1980 fiscal year."

To rectify that, the Environmental Protection Agency last week proposed a new rule: Fines for noncompliance must equal the cost of compliance The name Pullman is so closely linked with railroad passenger cars that the Russians have been calling sleeping cars pullmanovskye spalnye vagony ever since the days of the czars. But Pullman Inc. hasn't made any sleeping cars since 1956, and last week the company said it was going to stop manufacturing other kinds of passenger cars as well. One reason is a loss of more than $23 million on a contract for New York subway cars. Two weeks ago, at the height of the spring migration, the bodies of 10,000 birds were found lying on roads, hanging from trees and strewn on cornfields near Newburgh, N.Y. where a farmer had spread fertilizer. A pathologist with the New York State Department of Environmental Conserva tion made a tentative diagnosis of nitrate poisoning from fertilizer. Ornithologists and farmers who have used the same fertilizer without harm expressed skepticism, and more tests were planned. When abortion is at issue, emotion runs high. Last week New York State Senator James H. Donovan, Republican of Utica, compared state funding of abortions for the poor to the Nazi Holocaust. “Through an unconscionable state policy,” he said, “50,000 lives are being snuffed out each year at a cost of over $20 million.”"
Legislative Action Gathers Momentum,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/25/archives/connecticut-weekly-legislative-action-gathers-momentum-hartfords.html,"HARTFORD JUST a few months ago, Ernest N. Abate, the new, idealistic young Speaker of the House, was talking about his plans to change the process by which the 187 men and women of the General Assembly decide the laws that affect pocketbooks, children, jobs, and even — this year —death.Hartford's Docket Action on major issues this year, such as coastal land management, the state's gambling industry, abortion, and insurance rates, Mr. Abate said then, would not be put off until the last weeks before adjournment on June ?? Usually, exhausted legislators debate and vote on hundreds of bills late into the night during marathon sessions just before adjournment. Mr. Abate, a 35‐year‐old Stamford lawyer, said he was going to introduce a new system. Under his plan, the House, acting in a model of orderliness, would calmly begin dispatching some of the substantive bills of the year by February. It's March. the Legislature has been meeting for two months, and the House, as usual, has barely budged. Many bills have been passed, but the only one of note was the proposal to limit police searches of newsrooms, which the Senate also passed and sent to the Governor. “I guess,” Mr. Abate reflected last week, “it's human nature to put off making tough decisions until the deadline.” He said it probably was a losing battle to try to speed up the process. “I pushed,” he said. “I met with every chairman, I wrote letters.” He said the limited response was “not because of any lack of effort on my part.” Idleness, everyone agrees, is certainly not the problem. Scores of public hearings have taken place every week since the session began in January, and committee members meet and vote daily on recommendations to the full House and Senate. On a recent day. for example, the Judiciary Committee started a meeting at 10 A.M., with 200 bills before it. Busloads of citizens arrive every week to testify on one thing or another, and frequently hundreds of people will rock the building with hoots or cheers at a hearing in the Hall of the House. One of the most contentious hearings of the year was held by Executive and Legislative Nomination Committee. For nine hours the committee heard testimony on the Governor's controversial nomination to the State School Board, Eva Hudak, and it was 1 A.M. on a Saturday before the meeting in the Senate chamber broke up. “The pace is normal,” Joseph J. Fauliso, the longtime Senator and President Pro Tempore of the chamber explained. “It simply takes a long time to draft a bill” so it can be placed before the House and Senate. “Now we're going to see a regular flow of bills,” Mr. Fauliso added, suggesting that tradition would prevail and bleary‐eyed legislators would once again face an avalanche of bills at the last minute. The two most difficult and most important bills of the year will be school financing and the budget. The effort to meet a court mandate to equalize financing for public schools around the state is by far the most complicated issue the Legislature has had to deal with in years. The Education Committee is laboring to draft a bill for Assembly consideration. But before the final votes are taken, the committee's co‐chairman, Dorothy Goodwin, predicted, a “bloody” fight will evolve between towns that stand to gain and towns destined to lose money under the bill. The budget, which the Governor has suggested carry a price tag of $2.4 billion, is always a struggle, and always emerges in the latter days of the session. In addition, there are a handful of bills on seemingly ancient controver sies. notably the “bottle bill.” An attempt is being made to delay — from next January until July 1981 — impiementation of the law passed last year requiring deposits on all soda and beer bottles and cans sold in the state. Several bills aimed at limiting abortions and an effort to have the state pay for abortions for welfare recipients are before various committees. However, Mr. Abate said the Legislature in general would prefer that the abortion issue not come up again. Last year's law requiring annual auto‐emissions tests is also back, the issues this year being the starting date, originally set for 1980, and the question of whether the state or a private contractor should do the testing. A proposal for mandatory sentencing for certain crimes and a bill on juvenile justice that would force 14‐year‐old repeat offenders of serious crimes to be tried in Superior Court instead of Juvenile Court are under serious consideration again this year. A proposed bill to use state funds to help towns desiring “workfare” programs for welfare recipients is likely to pit urban legislators against colleagues from the suburban and rural areas if it reaches the floor. The bill has cleared the Human Services Committee and is now awaiting review by the Appropriations Committee. Governor Grasso vetoed a “product liability” law last year because she was concerned that it might have gone too far in protecting businesses from i?? suits stemming from faulty products. Leaders of both houses feel certain that another bill will pass this year, but its form is uncertain. It is not at all unusual for the Legislature to debate a controversial issue for several years before enacting a law, even when most legislators believe the idea is a good one. One example of this is merit selection of judges. But sometimes, such as in the case of a productliability law, the question is not whether the legislators want a law, but how to write language that will strike the right balance, in this case between the needs of the consumer and the needs of business. Legislation on rights of homosexuals, which has been killed almost every year since 1973, provides an interesting example of how, on occasion, new solutions are found to issues. Some will argue that the new proposal has only minor changes, but the Judiciary Committee changed the name of the “gay rights” bill to the “sexual status bill” and included language that would do more than prohibit discrimination against homosexuals. The proposal would also prohibit landlords from dis?? against unmarried couples. And a t?? ??her could not be dismissed for living with someone out of wedlock or for being a homosexual. The key phrase is that any sexual behavior practiced “in private” would be protected. Facing a limited chance of survival because of opposition from the Senate's leadership, a bill to raise the drinking age from 18 to 19 has successfully emerged from committee and is now before the House. A major debate is expected on the coastal‐land‐management bill. Using Federal funds, the state is developing a plan for preservation of the shoreline, but waterfront towns fear loss of local autonomy. And land developel ?? are concerned that the plan might be too restrictive. Other environmental bills in the works include regulations to control shipments and disposal of nuclear and other toxic wastes. In addition. the Legislature must pass on a federally mandated state plan to clean up air pollution. A weak effort has been started to replace the Insurance Commissioner with a regulatory body something like the Public Utilities Control Authority. A more likely survivor is a proposal to finance a study on restructuring autoinsurance rates; the suggestion being that the current system of rates based on where a driver lives — urban dwellers are charged more — or age should be replaced with a system of rates based on a driver's record. The Governor's call for a constitutional amendment to limit state spending is not expected to “fly,” as Senator Fauliso puts it, although a measure to prohibit bonding for current expenditures seems pleasing to legislative leaders. Hundreds of bills have already been killed, but nothing is certain until the last day of the session. For example, a committee defeated a bill to try to define death — in order to facilitate organ transplants — but some legislators want to revive it. Dozens of other important proposals are before the Legislature, including some dealing with the problems of arson, with mandatory retiremegt, proposals for allowing statewide referendums and a proposed ban on out‐ofstate banks from operating here. And there are hundreds of minor bills and the perennial little headaches, such as the one to increase the fine to $25 for allowing a dog to roam. ■"

Like many novelists in these confusing times, she describes her deepest hurts and gravest disappointments in a jaunty style that makes her seem semi‐demented rather than witty When describing her abortion she says she feels guilty and despondent, but calls herself Scarless O'Hara and strikes a cute tone that ruthlessly undercuts her. “The cleanup went one‐two‐three. smiles all around, and as a door prize a bottle of ergotrate, ”to contract the cervix, calm down the bleeding.’ Limit, one to a customer, haha.

RIGHT By Carolyn Banks 244 pp New York The Viking Press. $9.95 A peppery, wisecracking English instructor at a community college “which required only that Its students be prehensile','’ Lida, the central character in “Mr. Right.” seems clever about everything except sex Although by her own reckoning she has slept with 30 men, Sht ?? finds them feckless, unfaithful or both Perhaps this has something to do with the way she selects her bedmates. Home from the hospital after having her tubes tied, she reads a sado‐masochistic thriller and promptly falls in love with the author, Duvivier, who produces books under two other names and has hidden yet a fourth name that might link him to a murder at a small college where he once taught. But when Lida writes to him, Duvivier promptly replies from a remote Spanish village and arranges to meet her during a quick business trip to the States. By the time he arrives, Lida has done research at the Library of Congress and inadvertently discovered that Duvivier is really Ronald Wendolyn, author of “Renaissance Stagecraft.” What she doesn't know is that Duvivier‐Wendolyn, fearing that he may have murdered a young girl who taunted him for his sexual inadequacies, has allowed the world to think Wendolyn died in an automobile accident. Inevitably Lida and he meet, eat and mate, and, because they are both essentially narcissistic and oral, they are much taken with each other. But then Duvivier‐Wendolyn realizes she is close to cracking his cover and decides she must die. Up to this point the story has unspooled with such pace that questions of credibility bounce away like beetles off a windshield. But there comes a point at which Carolyn Banks has pushed things too far and perpetrated too many dizzying reversals Finally the reader grows weary of being whirled about, and not even the never‐ending series of one‐liners — some of them quite funny — can plug all the holes in the plot. Still, Carolyn Banks has a sense of style and wit, and what Duvivier says about himself might be applied to her. She is the sort of writer “read by certain sophisticated people as one who offered light escape while, at the same time, not harshly insulting their intelligence.” THE GRAND DRAGON By Irma Kurtz. 218 pp. Thomas Congdon Books. New York: E. P. Dutton. $9.95. The nameless narrator of “The Grand Dragon” cannot de cide whether she is thrice blessed or thrice cursed. An independent woman, she wonders what she missed by not marrying. A successful freelance journalist, she has no illusions about her profession and the people it feeds on: “A lesson I had been too slow to learn — despite interviews with murderers and with politicians — was that every man longs to talk about himself, few have anything else to talk about and nobody is ashamed of any stupidity or perfidy, if it has made him, even briefly, of interest to the press.” A longtime expatriate, she lives in England. She is troubled because she is Jewish but doesn't understand, or, rather, resists understanding how this affects her life. Although she has borne her share of prejudice — a quota kept her out of a famous women's college — she feels uncomfortable with her parents, who are obsessed with fear and simple‐minded counterprejudices. When she returns to America to do an article on the Ku Klux Klan, her parents are angry and afraid — fearful she may be in danger, perturbed that she will bring publicity to an antiSemitic organization. But she insists on her intellectual freedom, and as long as the K.K.K. members are little more than racist gargoyles she feels in control. Then she meets the Grand Dragon, who is young, articulate and attractive. Not even his virulent anti‐Semitism destroys the chemistry between them, and, as mind yields to body, she goes to bed with him. The next day, however, at a Klan rally, she recognizes the seductive powers of demagoguery and realizes there can be no middle ground. One must choose. Abandoning her life of drifting neutrality, she decides to move with her parents to Israel. There is, to be sure, something too pat about this resolution. But what redeems “The Grand Dragon” is Irma Kurtz's often touching statement of the narrator's plight. ■"
Philadelphia Considers Proposal To Prevent Teen‐age Pregnancy,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/26/archives/philadelphia-considers-proposal-to-prevent-teenage-pregnancy.html,"PHILADELPHIA, March 25 — Vera Demchenko was 22 years old when she began teaching social studies six years ago at Simon Gratz High School in North Philadelphia. Students asked if she was married. The answer was no; they asked if she had children. “I told you I wasn't married,” Vera Demchenko said. She still remembers the incident because of the students’ reply, “That doesn't matter.” The Philadelphia Board of Education is to vote tomorrow on a proposal for an elective birth control education program for high school juniors and seniors, and Vera Demchenko is among those hoping it will be passed. It is estimated that 2,000 Philadelphia teen‐agers become pregnant every year. The course could be available to students by next September. Other major cities, including New York, Chicago, St. Louis and Washington. already teach public school children about contraception. Tomorrow's school board vote follows months of study, which began in October 1977 after Pennsylvania gave local school boards the right to decide whether birth control should be part of sex education courses. A 1939 state law had banned school instruction on birth control. School administrators envision a course teaching students about a wide range of birth control methods, from abstinence, withdrawal and rhythm, through the condom, pill, diaphragm and intrauterine device, to vasectomy and tubal ligation. Abortion would not be included. “The very topic of contraception is so startling, so threatening,” said the associate school superintendent, Dr. Bernard G. Kelner, “that abortion would just tip the whole thing over,” ending an program before it began. To take the course, students will need parents’ written consent. The school board intended this proviso to mute public criticism, and it seems to have worked. Although abortion opponents and worried parents jammed the public hearing earlier this month, the Board of Education's president, Arthur W. Thomas, predicts that it will endorse the development of a seven‐week course as part of the yearlong health education classes."
Carey Effecting State Cut in Tax On Capital Gain,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/27/archives/carey-effecting-state-cut-in-tax-on-capital-gain-uses-old-law-in.html,"ALBANY, March 26 — Dismayed by the Legislature's decision not to act immediately to cut the state tax rate on capital gains, Governor Carey is using a technicality in the tax law to effect virtually the same reduction without the Legislature's approval. Aides of the Governor said that because of the unusual calculation method provided by state law, they believed the Tax Commissioner had the power to pass along the 10‐percentage‐point reduction that Congress approved in the share of capital gains that are subject to Federal tax. But the chairmen of the Assembly and Senate fiscal committees said they believed Mr. Carey had the power only to make one‐fifth to one‐third of the change on his own. And one top Assembly aide said the Legislature might try to pass a bill to stop the tactic entirely. “I think it's outrageous that the tax Commissioner should be enacting tax cues on his own without legislative authorization to do so,” said John L. Hardy, secretary to the Ways and Means Committee of the Democratic‐led Assembly. The Federal tax structure was changed last November to provide that 90 percent, rather than 50 percent, of capital‐gains income be taxable. Mr. Carey proposed as part of his budget to lower the state tax to 50 percent from 60 percent, a move he estimated would cost $25 million. The Legislature has ruled that out until later in the year, a move that rankled the Governor and the state's business community One aide said that the state Tax Commissioner, James Tully, had been making the change on his own, under Section 612.11 of the tax law, since the new Federal law took effect last Nov. 1, and that most of the Governor's aides had found out about it only recently. “I don't know whether it's illegal, but it's certainly counter to legislative intent,” said a top Republican aide. “We might want to do it later, but we don't want the Tax Department making those determinations.” With less than a week until the state begins its new fiscal year, the Republican‐led Senate, the Democraticled Assembly and the Governor's office remained apart on several major issues, including an education‐aid formula and revenue‐sharing for local governments. The three sides have agreed on a capital‐construction budget, without many changes from Mr. Carey's $474 million proposal, and are nearing agreement on a budget for state operations. Disagreements on financing for a board to oversee the state's new anti‐discrimination statutes in lending and for other projects of interest to black and Puerto Rican legislators were called sticking points. But the issue of Medicaid financing for abortions, which held up the budget last year for almost a week, appeared likely to be the final obstacle again. Meanwhile the Assembly took these actions: Nuclear Wastes The Assembly passed and sent to the Senate a bill that would in effect ban establishment of permanent nuclear‐waste repositories in the state. It would not affect an agreement reached between Albany and the Federal Government that would temporarily reopen the nuclear recycling plant in West Valley, N.Y. on a temporary basis. The sponsor of the bill, Assemblyman William B. Hoyt, Democrat of Buffalo, said the legislation was a first step in letting Washington know that New York would not be used as a “dumping ground” for nuclear waste. Farm Assessments The Assembly passed and sent to the Senate a bill that would limit increases in agricultural land‐assessment values to 8 percent in each of the next two years. The bill, sponsored by Assemblyman Matthew J. Murphy, Democrat of Lockport, is designed to protect farmers as the state develops new methods of determining the value of farmland. Child Abuse The Senate voted to give courts the right to take away the children of parents who abuse them. Even a child who had not been abused could be taken away if the parents had abused a brother or sister. The bill, which now goes to the Assembly, would strip such parents of all their parental rights permanently, and let the state put the child or children up for adoption or foster care. The sponsor, Joseph R. Pisani, New Rochelle Republican, said existing law did not apply to some of the worst cases of child abuse."
Capital Voting Rights Amendment Runs Into Trouble,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/27/archives/capital-voting-rights-amendment-runs-into-trouble-equal-rights.html,"WASHINGTON, March 26 — Despite ratification of a proposed District of Columbia voting rights amendment in Massachusetts and Minnesota last week, supporters of the measure concede that they still face tough opposition in their effort to win‐the approval of 38 states necessary to ratify the amendment by 1985. The amendment would give the District of Columbia two Senators and a number of Representatives in proportion to its population. In the 1970 census the District had about 700,500 residents, a population larger than that of nine states —Alaska, Delaware, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming. It is represented in Congress by one delegate, who can participate in debates but has no vote. Since the proposed amendment was approved by Congress last August, only five states, including Minnesota and Massachusetts, have ratified it. It has been rejected in eight states, and it appears in trouble in several other states, including New York, where it is likely to come up for action this year. ‘ “The conservative causes are really coming out of the woodwork on this, and we're finding out quickly that they're well‐organized and well‐funded,” said Melanie Woolston, a spokesman for the D.C. Ratification Committee. The committee, which is affiliated with Common Cause, the public‐affairs lobby, is coordinating support for the measure. Equal Rights Proposal Cited “Compared to E.R.A., which sailed through 25 or 30 states before it ran into trouble, we've hit our wall right away,” she added, referring to the proposed equal rights amendment that Congress approved in 1972. The proposed amendment, which would ban discrimination against women because of their sex, needs three more states to complete the ratification process. “I'm glad we have seven years to pass this because if we didn't we'd be in serious trouble,” said Walter E. Fauntroy. the District delegate and the amendment's principal sponsor, in an interview last week. Mr. Fauntroy added that he and other supporters were somewhat surprised by the intense opposition the proposed amendment has encountered because of their earlier experience with the 23d Amendment. That amendment, which gave District residents the right to vote in Presidential elections, easily won ratification by the states in 1961. Supporters of the proposed voting rights amendment attribute the opposition to two factors. The first is a growing reluctance among state legislatures still mired in controversy over the equal rights amendment to supra?? changes in the Constitution. Gains for Liberals Likely “It's getting tougher for any kind of constitutional amendment these days,” said Ruth Hinerfeld, president of the League of Women Voters of the United States, which has lobbied for the voting rights amendment for 55 years. “I believe it's symptomatic of a concern that the Government is doing too much.” The second factor, supporters say, is fear among conservative groups that representation for the District will dilute their strength in Congress. Both proponents and opponents of the amendment agree that the District, which is 74 percent black and more than Percent Democratic, would probably Democrats to Congress. Although supporters of the. proposed amendment contend that its is a matter of “simple justice,” opponents, who range from the Citizens. Committee for the Right to Keep and Dear Arms to antibusing and anti‐abortion groups, maintain that it will encurage territories and large steps seek similar representation. Besides Minnesota and Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey and Ohio have ratified the amendment. The proposal has been rejected in Arizona, Idaho, Maryland, New Mexico, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South carohan and Wvoming."
Panel Rejects Gov. Grasso Choice for School Board,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/28/archives/panel-rejects-gov-grasso-choice-for-school-board.html,"HARTFORD, March 27 — A General Assembly legislative committee voted 8 to 3 today to oppose Gov. Ella T. Grasso's nomination to the Connecticut State Board of Education of Eva Hudak, a 62year‐old state bail commissioner who dropped out of school at the age of 14 and recently passed a high‐school equivalency test. The unfavorable vote by the Joint Cornmittee on Executive Nominations would appear to jeopardize prospects for final approval by the House and Senate chambers. Governor Grasso has repeatedly said she would not withdraw the nomination, which has generated more controversy than any other issue before the General Assembly thus far this year. After the vote today, Richard C. Bozzuto, a Waterbury Republican who is the Senate minority leader, joined others in calling on the Governor to withdraw the nomination. “Her apparent inability to look at both sides of an issue,” Senator Bozzuto said of Mrs. Hudak, “has led me to believe that her past efforts to censor books would create problems and unnecessary controversy in our education system.” Two of the major education organizations in the state, The Connecticut Education Assocation and the Connecticut Association of Boards of Education, have also opposed the nomination. Critics have drawn on many issues in their campaign against Mrs. Hudak, who testified at her confirmation hearing that she had never heard of “The Scarlet Letter,” by Nathaniel Hawthorne. She is an active opponent of abortion, the Equal Rights Amendment and sex education in the schools, but many insist that it is Mrs. Hudak's “methods,” rather than her phi losophies, that are objectionable. She has been variously called “abrasive,” “a pain in the neck” and an “obstructionist.” Her defenders, notably the Connecticut Conservative Union and the Connecticut Citizens for Decency, say Mrs. Hudak is being tarred by anti‐Roman Catholic forces as well as feminists and those who favor abortion. Defending her nomination at a new conference earlier this month, Mrs. Grasso spoke of the need to provide “opportunities for persons to be heard on both sides” of an issue. However, she also said she had not chosen Mrs. Hudak because she wanted a conservative voice on the board."
What the Grass Roots Say to Albany,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/28/archives/what-the-grass-roots-say-to-albany-conviction-is-a-weapon.html,"ALBANY, March 27—They come here by the busload, soldiers in a war of influence, armed with position papers, catchy slogans and their emotiors. They roam the halls of the Capitol seeking legislators who are for them, against them or on the fence. They are the grass roots lobbyists, and they arrive here in number each Tuesday as sure as the Senators and Assemblymen arrive on Mondays. There are 976 registered lobbyists who work the halls of the Capitol, but their number is dwarfed by the tens of thousands of unregistered lobbyists, who need not report to the state as long as they do not spend more than $1,000a year on their activities. The influence of the grass roots lobbyists is often greater than that of the wellorganized and well‐financed professionals. “Legislators have to react to people from their own district,” said Barbara Shack, a registered lobbyist for the New York Civil Liberties Union. “They may listen to me, but after all, I don't represent any votes.” “A few activists from my district can affect me more than Union Carbide,” said Senator Martin Markowitz, a youthful‐looking Brooklyn Democrat, after being pinched on the cheek by an elderly constituent lobbying for Medicaid abortions. In these final days before the Legislature votes on Governor Carey's $12.7 billion budget, lobbyists on both side of the abortion issue are here in force. But there are also the grass roots people concerned about school aid formulas, homosexual rights, tenant problems and library financing. The grass roots lobbyists tend to be awed by legislators, and they generally travel in groups. They often spend —some would argue waste — their time speaking to legislators who are already on their side. Their approach may not always be sophisticated, but their greatest weapon is their conviction that that they are right. “Do you know how much blood is being spilled?” asked Michael Sobeck, the doorman of a Manhattan building who took the day off from his job to spend it in Albany arguing against Medicaid funding of abortions. “This is the single most important issue in the Legislature.” In another part of the Capitol, Judy Cornwall also expressed strong feelings on the abortion issue. “This is terribly important — women should have a choice,” she said. Mrs. Cornwall was getting ready to wheel her 7‐month‐old son, Mark, through the Legislative Office Building. “I think it is really important to show legislators that people who are prochoice are also pro‐babies.” Not all the lobbyists are out to make such a strong impression. Assemblyman Harry Smoler, a Brooklyn Democrat, was recently visited by a group of Jewish War Veterans from his borough. “I can't even remember what they wanted,” said Mr. Smoler. “I think they just came by to, socialize, say ‘Hello, Harry,’ and be able to say that they were in Albany.” Sometimes, the lobbyists with the most clout are the ones who get to see the aides of legislators rather than the legislators themselves. Carol Clowe and Ruth Angell, members of Burnt Hills‐Ballston Lake School Board, met this afternoon with James R. Ruhl, an aide to the Senate majority leader, Warren M. Anderson, Republican of Binghamton. The two women were not even interested in seeing the Senator. They have been meeting regularly with Mr. Ruhl for the past several months. After raising with him a problem regarding the sale of property in school districts, Mr. Ruhl drafted a bill to remedy the situation. “Grass roots lobbyists get the most accomplished with staff,” Mr. Ruhl said. “The legislative staffs are information seekers, and people like this are the best field information sources we have.” One grass roots lobbyist seeking out legislators today was Werner Kuhn of the New York State Coalition for Gay Organizations. Mr. Kuhn, an Albany lawyer, was seeking support for a child custody bill that would forbid a judge to deny custody or visitation rights because of the sexual orientation of a parent. Mr. Kuhn believes that face to face lobbying is more effective than letter writing or professional lobbyists. “The most effective way to influence legislators is to bring gay men and lesbians here to talk to them,” he said after meeting with Assemblyman Mark A. Siegel. “We have to break through the stereotypes and show legislators that we come in all shapes, sizes, religions and looks.” However, Assemblyman Smoler wasn't certain of the effectiveness of lobbyists’ meeting with Assemblymen and Senators. He noted that many of the major decisions in Albany were made by the Governor and the leadership of both houses. “I think the lobbyists sometimes give us credit for more power than we actually have,” he said. “But I'm not going to disillusion them.”"
Carey and Legislators Work Out School‐Aid Rise Plan,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/28/archives/carey-and-legislators-work-out-schoolaid-rise-plan-other-budget.html,"ALBANY, March 27 — Governor Carey and legislative leaders tentatively agreed tonight to increase state aid for education by $185 million next year and revenuesharing to local governments by $80 million, tied to a formula that would slow the growth of revenue‐sharing aid in the future. The plan, put together in a two‐anda‐half‐hour meeting in the Governor's office, is expected to be presented to legislative party caucuses tomorrow. The education‐aid increase would be about $20 million less than Mr. Carey proposed, but would guarantee that no school district receives less money than it did last year, according to those close to the negotiations. The Governor wanted to cut state aid to some school districts —particularly in wealthier suburbs with declining enrollments — and increase aid to poorer school districts to speed state compliance with pending court decisions asking that education spending be equalized around the state. Mr. Carey's proposal for revenue‐sharing — the least limited form of state aid to local governments — would have held it to last year's level, and thus the entire $80 million is an increase over his request. The net increase in spending between the education‐aid and revenue‐sharing plans, $60 million in the next fiscal year, would be financed by cuts elsewhere in the budget made by the Legislature. Under consideration is a plan that would roll part of the impact of the increase in 1980‐81 into the state's 1981‐82 fiscal year, when the state expects to be in a better position to afford it. In return for the revenue‐sharing increase, negotiators said, Mr. Carey will get a formula that will link future cotnputations of revenue‐sharing aid to the state's entire revenue structure, rather than solely to the faster‐growing personal income tax, as is now the case. The current formula spreads 18 percent of the personal income‐tax receipts among local governments; the new formula would give 8 percent of the whole state tax‐receipt base to them. Negotiators were noncommittal after the meeting and details were sketchy. Their caution stemmed from a decision by Republican Senators last week to scuttle an agreement along similar lines because they found its education‐aid provisions too penurious. A top aide to the Senate's Republican leadership warned again that “school aid can only be Accepted by agreement of the conference.” The aide said, however, that the $80 million revenue‐sharing aid figure seemed “about right,” however. Other aspects of the budget — particularly the problem of Medicaid financing for abortions, which threatens to snag its passage later this week — remained unresolved. Earlier in the day, Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink, Democrat of Brooklyn, abandoned his quest for an increase in welfare grants, which Governor Carey said the state could not afford and many Republicans opposed outright. “You win some and you lose some, and I'm prepared to admit I've lost this one,” Mr. Fink said. Assessment Proposal Offered The Speaker also proposed that the state legalize property assessments that favor homeowners over the owners of industrial and commercial properties. He said this was necessary to prevent “a very draconian and unnecessary” shift in the property‐tax burden to homeowners — as much as a 113 percent increase for homeowners in New York City. His plan would wri,te into state law the widely used system of classification” under which homeowners’ property is assessed at a lower proportion of its true value than other types of property. Because there is no legal basis for this system, it has been struck down by state courts in various cases as being discriminatory, and local governments have been ordered to bring their assessments for all types of property into line by 1981. The plan will almost certainly draw opposition from business interests — whose taxes stand to drop under equal‐assessment plans — and is unlikely to get the full suppport of the Carey administration, which is expected to favor modifications in the current classifiation system. The Temporary State Commission on Real Property Tax is scheduled to issue a report on the matter next Monday."
Albany Leaders Agree on Pruning $1 1 7 Million From Carey's Budget,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/29/archives/albany-leaders-agree-on-pruning-117-million-from-careys-budget.html,"ALBANY, March 28 — Legislative leaders agreed today to cuts of $117 million in Governor Carey's proposed budget — largely in judiciary, mental‐hygiene and debt‐service costs — as they struggled to complete a money package for the new fiscal year that begins Sunday. The leaders, meanwhile, proposed $185 million increase in state aid to schools — most of it to poorer school districts — and restoration of $80 million in revenue‐sharing aid that localities would have lost under proposals originally put forward by the Governor. There were complaints from legislators whose regions got less money than they would have under Mr. Carey's plan to increase education aid by $206 million, but legislative leaders expressed hope they could convince their members to accept the new plan. The new education and local‐aid appropriations, which were tentatively agreed to last night by Mr. Carey and legislative leaders, are $60 million higher than Mr. Carey's original proposals. The increase would be financed by reductions in state agency spending. About $20 million of the new education money would be in the form of “categorical aid,” $16 million of it to New York City, that could not be spent for purposes other than education. Mayor Koch had wanted to use the entire increase in state education aid to close his budget gap, but aides to Mr. Carey said there would be more than enough money elsewhere in the state budget to give the Mayor the $207 million he says he needs. Meanwhile, the state prepared a variety of contingency measures, including the possible printing of scrip, if a budget snarl developed over Medicaid financing of abortions and prevented the state from paying 86,000 of its employees scheduled to receive wages next Thursday. Faced with the delays in getting the budget bills printed, legislative leaders have given up the possibility of passing the budget on time, and the Legislature is expected to recess tomorrow and not take up the budget until Monday, the day after the fiscal year begins. As negotiations on other parts of the budget continued furiously, aides said the legislative leaders reached a variety of agreements, including the following: ??Attorney General Robert Abrams will not receive the $737,700 he requested to set up an office to intervene in utilities cases on behalf of consumers. Senate Republicans had objected to giving such money both to Mr. Abrams and to the Consumer Protection Board, which had asked for $515,000 to intervene for consumers and will get at least part of its request. ??The State Commission of Investigation will not be abolished, as had been proposed by Republicans. But the commission may face a cut of $100,000 from its $1.3 million budget. ??A variety of social programs, particularly within the Division for Youth, have been eliminated from the budget, or are in danger of being cut. Among the victims of the cuts are an alcoholism rehabilitation center in Buffalo, a number of secure facilities for violent youths and secure units within the Office for Mental Health for mentally ill, violent juveniles. Finally, two offices that would have been headed by Lieut. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo — an ombudsman's bureau and a Local Expenditure Review Board to monitor local spending — have been cut from the budget."
Democrats Drop Fight For Funds to Enforce State's Lending Laws,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/30/archives/democrats-drop-fight-for-funds-to-enforce-states-lending-laws.html,"ALBANY, March 29 — Leaders of the Democratic‐controlled Assembly dropped their fight today for a $180,000 appropriation to enforce the state's new laws against geographic discrimination in lending. They ?? ?? than accede to a Republican demand that would have limited the Banking Superintendent's powers to take action against banks found guilty of the practice. Instead, legislative aides said, the Democrats will take up the issue separately from the budget and try to pressure the Republicans into accepting it by accusing them of acting to weaken the laws against descrimination in lending. But without making the agreement part of the budget, success was viewed as unlikely. The decision resolved the last major obstacle to agreement by the legislative leadership and Governor Carey on the $12.7 billion budget for the fiscal year that begins Sunday. Although there was some grumbling, legislators in both houses seemed prepared to accept a revised education formula that would increase state aid by $185 million, mostly to poorer school districts, and an $80 million increase in revenue‐sharing aid to local governments. But rank‐and‐file legislators opposed to abortion are likely to snarl that agreement Monday, when the budget comes to the Senate floor, by amending the localassistance budget to remove. ?? financing for abortion. The strategy among those who want to keep the money for Medicaid abortions in the budget — including Governor Carey — was apparently to allow the deadlock to occur, and then to urge local governments and school districts to mount a pressure campaign on abortion foes in an effort to dislodge their money. The state's new chief administrative judge, Herbert B. Evans, warned today that the recommended cuts in the $359.8 million judiciary budget he asked for would require him to close the 20 special court parts set up last September to expedite cases of violent felony offenders, and to reduce the work force of nonjudicial employees by hundreds. But one top fiscal aide ?? the judiciary spent $20 million less than asked for in the last fiscal year and did not need all that it asked for."
Anderson Offers Plan to Save Hospital,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/31/archives/anderson-offers-plan-to-save-hospital-a-very-forward-step-gop-urges.html,"ALBANY, March 30 — The State Senate majority leader, Warren M. Anderson, today proposed a plan to rescue the bankrupt Brooklyn Jewish Hospital and Medical Center. The proposal would link $3 million in state assistance for Brooklyn Jewish to requirement that Governor Carey and Mayor Koch agree to and make public “a comprehensive plan for the elimination of 3,000 excess beds at various hospitals throughout the city.” Both Republicans and Democrats said it could be the basis for a compromise that would keep the hospital open. The announcement late this afternoon from Mr. Anderson, who had resisted Governor Carey's plan to save the hospital, came as Carey administration officials warned that they would start to close the hospital Monday if at least $2.25 million was not forthcoming from the Legislature to keep the hospital open for three more months. The Federal bankruptcy judge handling the hospital's case, Joseph V. Costa, said tonight that Mr. Anderson's statement would allow the hospital to “go on operating as if nothing had happened.” Judge Costa, who had said the hospital would have to close by Monday, said Mr. Anderson's statement “will give the hospital an opportunity to breathe so that, if possible, some plan can be worked out” to keep it open. Mr. Anderson praised the hospital for “a long and distinguished record of providing high‐quality health care to generations of New Yorkers.” But he asserted that “it would be “pointless” to offer state aid “unless we find out whether appropriate officials intend to keep Brooklyn Jewish open at all, or at what level.” Aides to Governor Carey and to Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink, a Brooklyn Democrat, said Mr. Anderson's proposal would bring stalled negotiations back to life. ‘A Very Forward Step’ “We feel this is a very forward step in the right direction,” said a top health aide to Governor Carey. “With this kind of movement and good will, something can be worked out to save Brooklyn Jewish.” The aide said the administration would “try to give them as much information as we can,” but would seek to soften Mr. Anderson's demands. Mr. Carey and Mr. Koch have been working on plans to close thousands of hospital beds in both public and private hospitals. “It moves it forward in the sense that they're dealing with the issue,” said David Langdon, a spokesman for Mr. Fink. But Mr. Langdon said Assembly Democrats would continue to push for emergency money with fewer restrictions than Mr. Anderson had proposed. Earlier in the day, the state's Health Commissioner, Dr, David Axelrod, had announced that the hospital would stop accepting new patients and begin transferring the 5‐19 patients now in residence to other hospitals on Monday. G.O.P. Urges Comprehensive Plan Dr. Axelrod said that the hospital could be emptied in “three to five days” and that under existing contingency plans, the patients would be transferred primarily to Kings County, Coney Island and Lutheran Hospitals in Brooklyn. The hospital, which employs 2,000 people, appeared doomed earlier this week by opposition from Senate Republicans to any measure designed to give it more state funds. The Republicans have said repeatedly that they would oppose any plan that did not offer a comprehensive solution to the problem of hospital closings in the city. Judge Costa said he had “tried to reach and talk with Senator Anderson for about two days,” without success. He said that he had suggested a plan similar to the one Mr. Anderson had proposed during an earlier stage of the negotiations over Brooklyn Jewish, which had been one of the casualties during discussions of the state budget for the 1979‐80 fiscal year that begins on Sunday. Meanwhile, the State Comptroller, Edward V. Regan, announced that 86,000 state employees would be paid in scrip this week because of uncertainty over when the budget would finally be approved by the Legislature. Legislative leaders gave up hope this week of passing a budget on time and are scheduled to return here Monday. But the budget could remain snarled well past the deadline by an impasse over the emotional issue of whether state Medicaid funds should be used to pay for abortions for poor women."
The Region,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/01/archives/the-region-in-summary-job-security-is-not-a-hallmark-of-the-koch.html,"In his first 15 months in office, Mayor Koch has shaken the bureaucratic tree six times and six top‐level appointees have fallen out. In addition, three holdover appointees from the Beame Administration have been allowed to linger for a year or so and then resign. The Mayor would be the first to say that the shakedown has not been altogether smooth. Perhaps the most painful was the departure last week of Blanche Bernstein who was forced out as Human Resources Administrator and as the manager, with a budget of $4.3 billion a year, of the largest city agency. Mr. Koch had only recently described Miss Bernstein as “terrific” but said that he ultimately had to take action against her because of vaguely defined but “severe management Problems” and low morale. His step was uncharacteristally ambiguous, lending credence perhaps to her countercharge that he had made many public and private statements in praise of her accomplishments and then suddenly bowed to pressure. The Mayor's squeeze play was to appoint Stanley Brezenoff, 41, the Commissioner of Employment, as Miss Bernstein's first deputy but with full operating authority over the agency. After steaming all weekend, Miss Bernstein replied in an angry letter that she could not retain the top job without top responsibility. Her difficulties seemed to have stemmed from antagonisms built up among the city's black and Hispanic leaders who charged that she had become insensitive to the needs of their constituents, many of whom are on her agency's welfare rolls. Het response was that she had a mandate to cut those welfare rolls and that she had fulfilled it. Other appointees forced out were Robert J. Milano, deputy mayor for economic development; Patria Nieto Ortiz, briefly the Human Rights Administrator; Peter P. Smith 3d, ousted as Commissioner of General Services under charges — he was later jailed —of stealing money from his previous employers; Henry Axel Schupf, chairman of the Health and Hospitals Corporation, and Joseph Lynaugh, president of the same agency. The Beame holdovers who ultimately left were Anthony Vaccarello, Sanitation Commissioner; Thomas Roche, Personnel Director, and Anthony Russo, Director of Labor Relations. Another high‐level appointee (and former close friend) who was recently forced to leave was Bernard Rome, head of the Olftrack Betting Corporation; but he will retain a seat on the board of directors. Epidemic of Labor Unrest Not since the subway ana sanitation strikes in the first days of the Lindsay Administration has the city been hit as severely by job actions, three out of four of them against New York City itself, or against quasi‐public agencies. No end seems in sight for any of them. The milk‐drivers strike, the only one against private employers, went into its fifth week with the employers warning that they would move their milk‐processing operations upstate or to New Jersey if the strike was not settled soon. Their words were underscored by the increasing availability of New Jersey milk in supermarkets. The newest strike was by the 1,300 clerks who work in the 167 offices of the Offtrack Betting Corporation. Their earnings average about $10,000 a year but they want $18,000. Thousands of OTB bettors were stranded on long lines or outside closed doors when the agency was able to man only ten offices with supervisory personnel. Horseplayers were doubly punished. The mutuel clerks’ strike against the New York Racing Association went into its seventh week with no sign of settlement. The state is losing millions in tax revenues, but racing goes on with meager attendance and limited betting at windows manned by nonunion and management personnel. Mayor Koch took considerable flak toward the end of the week when one of his “town meetings” — on Staten Island — turned into an unruly debate over the school‐bus strike that is now affecting over 100,000 pupils. Parents complained about accidents that occurred during the strike and the lack of alternative public transportation for their children. The Mayor said that extra buses would run this week but that 6,000 handicapped children would still have first priority. He was shouted down. Grasso Nominee Fails Round One Nationwide studies showed last week that parent and community groups have stepped up their censorship of reading materials in the public schools since the permissive days of. the late 60's and early 70's. The controversy was nowhere more pronounced than in Connecticut where Gov. Ella T. Grasso stood by her nomination to the State Board of Education of a bail commissioner who dropped out of school at 14, only recently passed a high‐school equivalency examination, and testified at her confirmation hearing that she had never heard of “The Scarlet Letter” by Hawthorne or “The American Tragedy” by Dreiser. The real question was why Governor Grasso persevered. Of the nominee, Eva Hudak, Mrs. Grasso only said: “I think there is a place for a person with a difference of opinion. She has shown grace under fire.” Other defenders, including the Connecticut Conservative Union and the Citizens for Decency, charged that Mrs. Hudak was being tarred by anti‐Roman Catholic forces, by feminists and by advocates of abortion. Still, a General Assembly legislative committee voted 8 to 3 last week to oppose the nomination and the vote appeared to jeopardize Mrs. Hudak's prospects for final approval. Segregation Urged For Unruly Pupils New Jersey is tackling head‐on the question of transfering disruptive students to special schools to help teachers preserve order for pupils who want to learn. A committee on reducing school violence recommended in Trenton last week that students who repeatedly disrupt classes be sent to special regional schools that can handle them. The recommendation tops more than 200 under consideration by the Task Force on Reducing Violence and Vandalism to be presented to the State Board of Education next month. Anne S. Dilman of Perth Amboy, vice president of the State Board of Education, said the recommendation would then be sent out to school districts for comment and reaction. She said the board expected it to be highly controversial and opposed by many parents since it would stigmatize their children by singling them out for special treatment and instruction. The board said it had no estimates of how many students would be involved. A Second Try on Homosexual Rights Viewing the Hartford City Council's latest attempt to enact a homosexual rights ordinance with apparent distaste, Mayor George Athanson noted the proposal's far‐reaching nature and called it “a can of worms.” The sweeping new ordinance bans discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, physical or mental handicaps, sex, age, and criminal history, as well as against homosexuals. Last summer, the Council thought it saw an opportunity to pass a homosexual rights ordinance during the Mayor's presumed absence on vacation. But Mr. Athanson's plane was delayed, and he vetoed the measure from a LaGuardia Airport hotel before departing. Under the pressures of last year's election campaign, the Council chose not to try to overturn the veto. But with a 6‐to‐1 favorable majority this time, another Athanson veto appears unlikely to stand. Last week the Mayor said he hadn't decided what to do about it. The State's General Assembly also may have take a stand. A similar bill is pending in the State Senate. Design Deficiencies Plague Post Office New York City has got along without the huge Morgan Post Office on Manhattan's West Side since fire damaged it 12 years ago. Seventy million dollars has been spent on renovating it but last week, it was announced that the facility would remain closed indefinitely because $30 million more is needed to correct design and safety deficiencies. Representative Charles H. Wilson, Democrat of California and chairman of a postal subcommittee, took the play away from the Postal Service by making the announcement himself. He said the renovation to date “was probably the worst example of poor design standards in a postal facility I have ever seen.” Michael Wright and Alvin Davis"
Signs: ThisWay To a Dispute,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/01/archives/long-island-weekly-signs-this-way-to-a-dispute.html,"IF you travel on the Island's park ways, you may think your eyes are deceiving you when you glance at the signs that dot the roadway. But the fact is that the signs are getting Smaller. And if the State Department of Transportation has its way, those signs will continue to shrink over the next few years. The department is engaged in a dispute with the Federal Highway Administration over that agency's standards for the size and color of signs. As a result, not one permanent sign has been put up on the Island's parkways since 1975. The Federal agency says letters on those signs and, hence, the size of the signs should be the same height as those on all limited‐access highways in the country. Michael M. Francese, assistant to the regional director of the State Department of Transportation, agrees that all the signs should be green with white lettering, as the Federal Government requires, though some brown signs have been put up recently. He insists, however, that the signs do not have to be as large here as they are for the rest of the country. For the Island, Mr. Francese wants the regulation lowered from the Federal standard of 16 inches for capital letters and 12 inches for small letters to 13% inches for capitals and 10 inches for small ones. He says the Island's parkways do not fit the pattern of most of the nation's limited‐access highways and that the smaller signs would be more appropriate. The larger letters were designed so drivers could see them over trucks, Mr. Francese said, but most of the parkways here prohibit trucks. Also, he said, the regulation applied more to long, straight stretches of roadway, where signs can be seen at great distances. Most Long Island highways are “geometrically” different, with few of those long stretches, he said. “We believe our request is justified,” he said, adding that the smaller signs would be cheaper and more “esthetically pleasing.” “We have an abortion on our hands,” he asserted, alludng to signs put up by the Long Island State Parks and Recreation Commission, which maintained the parkways until October 1975. After the state's takeover, Mr. Fran‐ cese said, The department ran into major problems in trying to replace the commission's small signs with regulation ones. In many, cases, they did not fit in the same space and would have had to be moved to another location, had they been put up at all. Thus, all the department has been able to do is either repair broken signs or replace demolished ones with smaller “temporary” ones until the Highway Administration makes a decision on its request. Those signs, in most cases, were put up only to insure that drivers did not miss exits, and little care was given to their size or esthetics. Most of them are small and awkward‐looking. However, those temporary signs may turn’ out to be not so temporary. The department orders its signs from a shop in upstate Hamburg, where they take “at least a few months” to make, according to Mr. Francese. So, whatever the Federal agency's decision is, it will be some time before any new permanent signs reach the Island. Meanwhile, Robert E. Conner, chief of the traffic control systems division of the Federal Highway Administration, said he was sympathetic to the problems the department has in trying to replace signs. But he added, “The needs of the driver are foremost. All these needs have to be assessed in a realistic, sympathetic way.” Mr. Conner said his staff was conducting a survey of the Island's parkways to determine if the state's proposal would work without sacrificing safety. “It's just a matter of a few weeks,” he said, before the staff makes its recommendation, which he said he would most likely abide by. Asked why no regulation‐size signs had been erected on the parkways since the state takeover in 1975, he replied: “I'm not involved in the day‐to‐day operations of the department. I'm sure they're doing the best they can. It's serious, but they have the responsibility for maintaining the roads.” Once his decision does come, drivers can be assured of at least one thing. “They'll all be green with white lettering,” Mr. Francese said, adding, “This time we're going by the book.” He explained that under Federal regulations the brown signs put up by the commission in recent years would denote a park area. “I guess,” he said, “they thought all of Long Island was a park.” ■"
Clash Over a Nomination,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/01/archives/connecticut-weekly-clash-over-a-nomination-nomination-clash.html,"GOVERNOR GRASSO'S nomination to the State Board of Education of Eva Hudak, a 62year old Torrington bail commissioner who dropped out of school when she was 19 during the Depression and who recently passed a high‐school equivalency test, has created what HARTFORD State Senator Joseph Fauliso, a veteran of many political wars, sees as one of the sharpest controversies in the state Capitol in years. ‘ “This is the first time I've seen such a great controversy over a nomination,” said Senator Fauliso, a Hartford Democrat who is president pro ternpore of the Senate. Despite a vote against Mrs. Hudak's nomination by a legislative committee, the Governor continues to back her. “My support for Eva Hudak’ continues,” Mrs. Grasso said at a news conference Thursday. “I think there is a place for a person with a difference of opinion.” Mrs. Hudak's lack of formal education is one of many reasons cited for op posing her nomination. Critics have seized on her testimony at her confirmation hearing, where she said she had never heard of “The Scarlet Letter” by Nathaniel Hawthorne, as evidence of Mrs. Hudak's poor qualifications for the state school board. However, Mrs. Hudak has been bombarded on numerous other fronts with attacks that often have nothing to do, with education. Hundreds of people packed the Senate Chamber two weeks ago to testify both for and against her nomination. It took nine hours to hear them all, and the hearing did not end until 1 A.M. on a Saturday morning. As an active opponent of abortion and the Equal Rights Amendment, Mrs. Hudak has met massive opposition on those questions that often clouds other issues. The abortion and ERA controversies have been escalated by her defenders, most notably the Connecticut Conservative Union and a group called Connecticut Citizens for Decency. Mary Ann Pressamarity, who has headed the support movement for Mrs. Hudak by the Decency group, is among the state's most vigorous anti‐abortion spokesman. A recent newspaper ad by the Connecticut Citizens for Decency read : “Eva knows what is going on in many schools. Dirty books are being read, sex education is being taught without morals. Children are not being told sex outside of marriage is wrong — fornication!” The state branch of the League of Women Voters, which clings to its role as a voice on issues, never personalities, jumped into the controversy after several of the Connecticut Citizens for Decency ads appeared. The league went to the State Ethics Commission and demanded that the Connecticut Citizens for Decency register as lobbyists. Carol Lyons, the president of the Conservative Union, has fueled the controversy by charging that “a serious element of religious bigotry” has surrounded the nomination. Mrs. Lyons said that Phillip Garavoy, president of the Connecticut Education Association, told a radio audience that Mrs. Hudak represented only her own views, developed through the teachings of her church. Mrs. Hudak is a Roman Catholic. “Mr. Garavoy's comments at least bring out what is really behind the opposition to Mrs. Hudak's nomination,” Mrs. Lyons said. “Mrs. Hudak represents the viewpoints of many people,” Mrs. Lyons maintained, “including a lot of bluecollar union members, and their views ought to heard.” She also noted that Mrs. Hudak's public service “spans 39 years” and that she served for “16 years on the Citizens Advisory Council to the State Welfare Department, working within the system.” Both the Education Association and the Connecticut Association of State School Boards have opposed the nomination, based largely on reports of Mrs. Hudak's involvement with education in her hometown of Torrington, where both bemocratic leaders and the Board of Education are actively campaigning against her appointment. ‘ According to Victor Muschell, the Continued on Pose 7 Nomination Clash chairman of the Torrington Board of education, she . insisted on getting copies of every book used in the school system. so she could review them for their sexual content. After a long, bitter battle lead by Mrs. Hudak over sex education in the schools, the board de‐, cided to introduce a course in the high schools. Mrs. Hudak and her colleagues insisted on attending the classes for months, which, critics say, embarrassed the students and hampered the teacher. “But her opinions are not the issue,” said Mr. Muschell, “it's her manner.” Calling her “abrasive” and a “pain the neck,” Mr. Muschell noted that she filed three Freedom of Information complaints against the board, requring ‘ board members to travel to Hartford to defend themselves. The Republican Senate minority leader, Richard C. Bozzuto of Watertown, asked the Governor, as did others, to withdrawn the nomination. Mr. Bozzuto said: “My opinion is based on my serious doubt of her ability to work constructively with other members of the State Board of Education ... I aril concerned with her lack of knowledge as to the fiscal matters facing the board and the seriouness of the equalization of educational funding which the Legislature is now grappling with.” Mrs.. Hudak said she was suprised and “disappointed” by the depth of opposition to her appointment. When, at her‐ confirmation hearing, State Senator Michael Morano, Republican of Greenwich, asked Mrs. Hudak to respond to reports that she was “dogmatic” and “closed‐minded,” Mrs. Hudak replied with a startled “Wow.” “I'vé had a lot df experience and I've lived a long time,” she said. “I don't know how people have found me. If they do find me that way, I apologize.” The nomination, which awaits action by both the House and Senate, received an unfavorable report last week from the legislature's Joint Committee on Executive Nomination. One of the key votes on the committee, which opposed the nomination by a tally of 8 to 3, came from Senate Majority Leader Joseph I. Lieberman, who has reportedly been very concerned about the Governor's possible reaction to his failure to support her nominee. He voted negatively and later explained that he was wort ried about Mrs. Hudak's “constant contentiousness.” Senator, Fauliso, Who is also a member of the committee, Voted td approve the nomination, thus leaving the question of the Senate's final approval or disapproval. in doubt. The Governor has repeatedly refused to withdraw Mrs'. Hudak's nomination. At a news conference earlier this month, Mrs. Grasso spoke of the need to provide “opportunities for persons to be heard on both sides” of an issue. At the same news conference, however, the ‐Governor also said she had not chosen Mrs. Hudak because she wanted a conservative or alternative voice on the board. Mrs. Grasso said she had chosen Mrs. Hudak because’ “she was a citizen who was interested in serving” and not because anyone had recommended her. Moreover, the Governor said she had not solicited opinions of Mrs. ‐Hudak's qualifications for the post from either local Torrington political officials or educators. Mrs. Grasso said such background checks were not her policy."
WESTCHESTER JOURNAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/01/archives/westchester-weekly-westchester-journal.html,"INVITATIONS for the more than 1,300 guests at Monday's state dinner honoring the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty came from many sources, and for many reasons. Two of Westchester's invitees — there may have been others — were a case in point. The County Executive, Alfred B. DelBello, was an early and consistent supporter of President Carter, and was invited with his wife, Dee, to the historic signing on the North Lawn and the state dinner on the South Lawn. They were on the White House list and they were able to chat briefly with the principals. “Mr. Carter introduced me to Anwar Sadat, who I thought was the key to the entire process,” Mr. DelBello said. “Then I reminded the President of a time past, when he was a candidate and we sat together in an apartment in New York, and how different this was. He smiled from ear to ear.” Zahava Burack of Harrison was there with her husband, Robert, but they were on a different list — she's not sure which. Mrs. Burack, who met Mr. Carter at a County Democratic Party dinner in 1975 and later headed his election campaign in Westchester, is a former Israeli. She has raised money for Mr. Carter, for Israel and for American Jewish organizations. Each of these groups, and many others, contributed guests to the occasion, which Mr. DelBello described as “exciting and impressive, and tremendously well organized when you realize they put it together in five days.” At each dinner table, he said, was a State Department host or hostess as well as an Egyptian and an Israeli, in his case a Cairo businessman and a Jerusalem, official. The signing, he said, was difficult for many to see, especially when those in front “kept leaping up to take pictures.” There were also autograph seekers, Mrs. Burack among them, she said, on behalf of herfourth son, a 17year‐old student at Harrison High School. The signatures were widely sought, even slowing the leaders’ tours of Capitol Hill the next day. Mrs. Burack said that she wept when the Navy Band played the Israeli national anthem, on the White House lawn and felt it was “the second nicest day of my life,” ranking it after the day she got to Israel from Poland. Menachem Begin, in his speech, listed it third —after his arrival in Israel, also from Poland, and the day Israeli soldiers recaptured the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem in the 1967 war. The Buracks dined buffet‐style in Blair House with many Israelis and Egyptians, joining the South Lawn festivities later. “After all those years,” said Mrs. Burack, who served a twoyear stint in the Israeli Army, “I could talk to members of the Egyptian parliament and their wives about how we were going to visit each other.” • A border dispute closer to home, between the Towns of Ossining and Mount Pleasant, may be resolved in a few months, according to Lewis H. Engel, the Ossining Supervisor, but not before the completion of some detailed negotiations based on century‐old maps. The Town of Ossining was created out of the Town of Mount Pleasant in 1895 and “for some reason,” Mr. Engel said, “Ossining's western boundary was set at the high water mark of the Hudson River as it then existed.” It is customary to set borders in the middle of bodies of water separating political jurisdictions, and that is the case, he said, with all other towns along the Hudson. Over the years, Ossining's shoreline was .extended with landfill. Mount Pleasant, it now appears, was the beneficiary of thgse extra acres because Ossining's post‐1845 border stopped at the water's edge, while Mount Pleasant's extended into the center of the river. “Half of the industrial center of the. village of Ossining sits on man‐made land,” Mr. Engel said, “as does a good. portion of the old Penn Central Railroad line [now Conrail] and a part of Sing Sing,” now the Ossining Correctional Facility. Sections of the villages of Ossining and Briarcliff Manor, each part of the Town of Ossining, also fall into that category, which means they are technically in Mount Pleasant. To further confuse matters, the state provided upland property owners in the 1800's with letters patent authorizing their ownership of land extending from 100 to 500 feet into the river. The uplenders became undisputed Ossining, residents, and thus that town collected taxes on their river property as it was filled in. Albany legislators tried to resolve the issue in 1968 but Governor Rockefeller vetoed the effort, saying it had to be settled by the towns themselves. And there it stands, more or less, with Mount Pleasant suggesting that Ossining owes a lot of back taxes, and Ossining saying that if that is the case then Mount Pleasant has to pay for a host of municipal services provided for the disputed property over the same peri.od. The issue came before the Board of Legislators last week when the, county noted that the approval of more than 50 percent of “river abutting landowners” must approve Ossining's bid to eXtend its jurisdiction to mid‐river. The county is such a landowner, as owner of a sewage treatment plant under construction, and Mr. DelBello asked legislators to authorize him to give his approval. There are 17 members of the Board of Legislators, a circumstance that has provided the name — the 18th Legislator Committee — for proponents of initiative and referendum in Westchester. They are seeking support for a new bid to resolve an old issue. To put initiatives or referendums on the ballot through direct legislation is to bypass elected officials. This poses a problem, as some see it, because the same lawmakers must approve the procedure before it can become part of the legislative process. In 1977, which was an election year just as this is, the County Board voted, 15 to 2, to ask staté legislators to give Westchester the authority to amend its charter to provide this means for voters to propose laws, presumably through petitions. It thus became the first county in the state to seek such authority. That was in March. It was not until June, however, that a formal homerule message was received in Albany, or too late in the legislative year for action. Efforts in 1978 also foundered. Now another bid is being made, with time again running out. Westchester proponents, among them Robert Rickles, executive director of the Institute for Public Transportation; John L. Loeb Jr., whose effort to introduce a similar procedure on the statewide level would require approval by two legislative sessions, and Paul Feiner, a Scarsdale Democrat — all political activists — are trying to draw attention to a public hearing on the issue Tuesday evening at 7:30 on the 8th floor of the County Office Building. Mr. Feiner says wearily that he was the only person attending a previous hearing. Mr. Rickles, former Air Resources Commissioner of New York City, says that initiative and referendum dates from the 1800's and, although available in 26 states, is rarely utilized. “It tends to attract legislation deemed to be difficult to pass because of vested interests,” he said. “At the same time, the public is quite discriminating, passing less than half the proposed legislation that gets to the ballot.” Last week, when members of the Board of Legislators went to Albany for their annual dinner and meeting with members of the Westchester delegation, they found themselves. walking the halls among proponents and opponent's of Medicaid‐financed abortions who were lobbying in groups of five and six from legislative office to legislative office. As Legislator Leonard Spano and his son, Assemblyman Nicholas Spano, were approaching the office of Assemblyman Gordon Burrows, the elder Mr. Spano was mistaken for his son and buttonholed by a lobbyists from Yonkers who demanded to know “Assemblyman Spano's” position , on the controversial issue. “And do you know what,” an incredulous Nicholas Spano said as he told the story later that evening at the delegation's dinner, “he told her his or my or somebody's position.” Leonard Spano, defending himself, explained. that the woman, whom he recognized as a former schoolmate, did not give him a chance to explain that he was the 48-year-old father of the 23year‐old Assemblyman. He allowed, however, that he was a bit flattered by the mistake. But what, he was asked by a number of dinner guests, did he give as ‘Assemblyman Spano's position” on Medicaid‐financed abortions? “I just said to her, ‘Lady, I have 16 children. What do you think my position is?’” ■ The New York Times Zahava Burack and Alfred B. DelBello: two of the guests at last week's White House ceremony for the signing of the Israeli‐Egyptian treaty."
Closing Arguments in Marvin Trial Set for April 10,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/01/archives/closing-arguments-in-marvin-trial-set-for-april-10.html,"LOS ANGELES, March 31 — After more than 11 weeks, testimony in the trial of Lee Marvin has come to a close with lawyers for the actor and Michelle Triola, the woman he lived with for six years, still contesting whether they had ever entered into an oral agreement that they would share their earnings and the property they acquired over the six‐year relationship. Closing arguments are scheduled for April 10. Judge Arthur K. Marshall of Los Angeles ‘Superior Court, who heard the case without a jury, is expected to rule a few days later. The case is the first major test of a 1976 ruling by the California Supreme Court declaring that unmarried couples may sue for division of property when their relationship ends or if one of the partners dies. Miss Triola, who legally changed her name to Michelle Marvin shortly before she and the actor separated in 1970, contends that she abandoned a promising singing career to serve as the actor's cook, companion and confidante because he promised to support her for life. Miss Marvin, who is seeking $100,000 for the loss of her career and half the $3.6 million the actor earned during their relationship, contends that she was Mr. Marvin's wife in every way except for having a marriage license. The actor, who won an Academy Award in 1965 for his portrayal of a gunfighter in “Cat Ballou,” told reporters Wednesday after the testimony had ended that it would have been cheaper for him to settle the case than to keep up the protracted legal battle. But he said he had not made a settlement because that would have meant acknowledging there had been an agreement. The 54‐year‐old actor testified in the course of the proceedings that he had never loved Miss Marvin, that he had felt trapped in the relationship and that he had never intended to support her for life. Miss Marvin, who is 46 years old, testified that she had undergone several abortions at the actor's request because he did not want children; that she had nursed him through numerous bouts of alcoholism and that the actor had frequently introduced her as his wife. She also said that since the couple separated in 1970 she had supported herself by watering plants for friends and by doing other odd jobs until she found a $125‐a‐week job as a secretary. More than 60 witnesses, including some of the most successful entertainers in Hollywood, testified in the case. Trini Lopez, the singer, testified that Miss Marvin had a “fair” voice but should have done a better job of promoting her record, “Promise Me Your Love.” Ruth Berle, wife of Milton Berle, the comedian, said the couple had a warm, happy relationship, and Edna McHugh, daughter of the late comedian, Eddie Cantor, said they behaved like a married couple. The case is being closely watched because a number of people have filed similar suits In New York and 15 other states seeking property rights that are commonly awarded after married coupled are divorced. “The outcome of this case is going to affect a lot of people because there has been a 1,500 percent increase over a 10‘year period in the number of unmarried couples living together,” said Marvin Mitchelson, Miss Marvin's attorney."
Inspectors ‘Shopping’ for Agent Orange,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/01/archives/long-island-weekly-inspectors-shopping-for-agent-orange.html,"FEDERAL and state inspectors are roaming through the stores of Long Island this week, but they are not looking for bargains. Instead, they are searching for herbicides and pesticides that contain Agent Orange, a chemical that can cause cancer, tumors, liver ailments, birth defects and genetic defects. The search is not confined to stores but also includes nurseries and golf courses. search is not confined to stores but also includes nurseries and golf courses. On March 1, the Environmental Protection Agency imposed an emergency ban on this chemical, and anyone found selling it can be fined up to $5,000 in civil action or given up to a year in jail and a fine of up to $25,000 in criminal action. A hearing on the emergency suspension will be held in Washington in the coming week, and then the E.P.A. will have 10 days to decide whether to continue the ban or drop it. Victor J. Yannacone Jr., a Patchogue lawyer and an expert on environmental law, recently filed a class action suit in the Federal District Court of the Eastern District on behalf of seven Long Island war veterans who allegedly were exposed to Agent Orange when it was sprayed by the United States Air Force over the jungles in Vietnam. The suit was filed against the Dow Chemical Company, Hercules Inc., Northwest Industries, the Diamond Shamrock Corporation, the Monsanto Company and the North American Phillips Corporation, as makers of the herbicide. The suit also named the Federal Government and Federal departments as defendants “as their several interests may appear.” The suit also listed as plaintiffs wives and children of the veterans. Two of the children are dead. They are Melissa Schuman, daughter of John and Eva Schuman, who died of birth defects shortly after her birth in 1966, and Denise Fennessey, daughter of Robert and Joanne Fennessey, who died three days after her birth in 1976. Michael and Maureen Ryan have an 8‐year‐old daughter, Kerry, who was born with many deformities, and Robert and Joanne Oakes have a 2‐year‐old daughter, Rachel, born without any external or internal reproductive organs. Guy and Kathy Salvio have a young son, Jeremy, who was born with a cleft palate and a deformity of the right ear that made him deaf, along with a nose with misplaced tissue. All the plaintiffs are from Suffolk County. Mr. Yannacone said: “The symptoms that were shown by these afflicted children, as well as the symptoms shown by many Vietnam veterans across the country who have died of cancer or liver ailments and many wives of veterans who suffered spon‐ taneous abortions, are consistent with the symptoms shown by laboratory animals exposed to dioxin. “It is not only Vietnam veterans who have been placed at the risk, but thousands of other persons who have been exposed to the toxic ingredient in Agent Orange that has been widely used to defoliate domestic areas.” The lawyer criticized the Long Island Lighting Company and the Long Island Rail Road for using the chemical even though environmentalists have been warning of the danger for.years. An L.I.R.R. spokesman said the chemical had formerly been used to clear rights of way but that other chemicals had been used since 1976. A Lilco spokesman said the utility had utilized Agent Orange on tree stumps, but following the March 1 ban, has been studying alternative methods of stump removal. “The fact that Lilco was still going to use the substance, if not for the Federal ban, is one of the most insufferable outrages I've heard of,” Mr. Yannacone said. “There are hundreds of unemployed adult males on Long Island who could be hired to pull up tree stumps. They had no right to expose people along their rights of way.” The lawyer also had sharp criticism for local governments on Long Island, saying: “Last August, we warned the governing bodies of the 10 towns on Long Island, the county government, and the state representatives of the dangers of dioxin and other toxic Substances being used on Long Island and getting into our underground water supply. But none of these branches of government made any effort to compel manufacturers to disclose exactly what toxic materials are contained in the chemical products sold out here.” Mr. Yannacone also criticized the Federal Government for not insisting on the testing of toxic substances by manufacturers using them in products sold to the public. “Every consumer product marketed anywhere in our metropolitan area that is capable of entering our ground water or surface water should be reasonably guaranteed as to safety,” he said. “We also should know what the substances are in chemicals brought by ships into New York Harbor.” Donald J. Middleton, Long Island director of the State Department of Environmental Conservation, agreed with Mr. Yannacone on the need for testing. “There are 70,000 synthetic chemicals on the Market now that have not been properly tested in terms of their potential toxic impact,” he warned. “The E.P.A. has the authority to control the marketing of these products under the Toxic Substance Control Act, but it does not have the funds or staff to do the job adequately. We may be sowing the seeds of major human destruction.” ■"
Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/01/archives/law-the-judge-has-ruled-the-bomb-is-secret.html,"CHICAGO — Perhaps other Federal judges have ‐been as reluctant to make a decision on a Constitutional issue as Robert W. Warren was in imposing “prior restraint” on The Progressive magazine to prevent it from publishing an article about the hydrogen bomb, but surely few have agonized more publicly about it. The ruling made Judge Warren the first Federal judge to grant a preliminary injunction against publication for reasons of national security. It was not a task he relished. “Such notoriety is not to be sought,” he said to a courtroom crowded with reporters before unsuccessfully trying to persuade the magazine to attempt an out‐of‐court settlement with the Department of Justice. 4vas appointed to the United States District Court in Milwaukee by President Nixon in 1974. For one year at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn., he was a roommate of Walter F. Mondale, now the Democratic Vice President. But Judge Warren became a Republican State Senator and went on to become Attorney General of Wisconsin. Bothas a state legislator and as Attorney General, his reputation was that of a law‐and‐order conservative, hard on crime and drug use and displeased by “permissive” courts. In Madison, he was considered to be the prime mover behind the Wisconsin legislature's 1969 contempt charge against the Rev. James Groppi, the Milwaukee priest who led welfare demonstrators in a noisy protest in the legislative chambirs. The United States Supreme Court later overturhed the contempt charge. While attorney general, he sought to close a Madi‐ Judge Warren, the son of a Methodist preacher, son abortion clinic, provoking the wrath of some women’ groups who later opposed his nomination to the Fed I District judgeship. But he won some liberal sup rt for his vigorous enforcement of environmental protection laws. Democratic acquaintances describe him as “a very fair person.” Since his appointment, Judge Warren has never been so near the focus of national attention. And in his statement from the bench, prepared before oral arguments were offered at last week's hearing, the judge showed he was aware of the historic nature of the case. He spoke of the importance of the First Amendment rights of a free press. “From the founding days of this nation,” he declared, “the rights to freedom of speech and of the press have held an honored place in our Constitutional scheme. The establishment and nurturing of these rights is one of the true achievements of our form of government.” The judge praised the magazine and Howard Morland, author of the article, for “their laudable crusade to stimulate public knowledge of nuclear armament and bring about enlightened debate on national policy questions.” He also acknowledged that this “first prior restraint against a publication in this fashion in the history of the country” would “curtail defendants’ First Amendment rights in a drastic arid substantial fashion.” And he added, “It will infringe upon our right to know and to be informed as well.” Noting that he would nevertheless assume the “awesome responsibility of issuing a preliminary injunction against The Progressive's. use of the Morland article in its current form,” he said that he also was “acutely aware of the pld legal adage that ‘bad cases make bad law.’ “ “This case in its present posture,” he said, “will undoubtedly go to the Supreme Court because it does present so starkly the clash between freedom of the press and national security. Does it go there with the blessing of the entire press? The Court thinks not. Many elements of the press see grave risk of permanent damage to First Amendment freedoms if this case g es forward. They feel appellate courts will find, as this court has, that the risk is simply too great to permit publication.” With that he urged the Government and The Progressive to agree to attempt an out‐of‐court settlement through the mediation of a panel of experts on what language could be deleted from the article to make it comply with the “restricted data” sections of the Atomic Energy Act of 1959. The compromise was accepted by the Government and turned down by The Progressive. In explaining why he was ruling against the magazine in spite of his concern for ‘freedom of the press, Judge Warren said: “What is involved here is information dealing with the most destructive weapon in the history of mankind, information of sufficient destructive potential to nullify the right to free speech and to endanger the right to life itself. “Stripped to its essence then, the question before the court is a basic confrontation between the First Amendment right to freedom of the press and national security.. “Our founding fathers believed, as we do, that one is born with certain inalienable rights which, as the Declaration of Independence intones, include the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. The Constitution, including the Bill of Rights, was enacted to make those rights operable in everyday life. “The Court believes that each of us is born seized of a panoply of basic rights, that we institute governments to secure these rights and that there is a hierarchy of values ‘attached to these rights which is “Certain of these rights have an aspect of imperativeness or centrality that make them transcend other rights. Somehow it does not seem that the right to life and the right to not have soldiers quartered in your home can be of equal import in the grand scheme of things. “While it may be true in the long run, as Patrick Henry instructs us, that one would prefer death to life without liberty, nonetheless, in the short run, one cannot enjoy freedom of speech, freedom to worship or freedom of the press unless one first enjoys the helpful in deciding the clash before qs now. freedom to live.” In summing up, he said that “a mistake in ruling against The Progressive will seriously infringe cherished First Amendment rights.” However, he added, “a mistake in ruling against the United States could pave the way for thermonuclear annihilation for us all. In that event, our right to life is extinguished and the right to publish becomes moot.” David Suter"
Evangelical Group Offers Campus Lectures,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/02/archives/evangelical-group-offers-campus-lectures-organization-born-in.html,"RUSTON, La., March 29 — A group of evangelical Christians has found a new way of reaching college‐age Americans — by offering classroom lecturers in a broad variety of subjects. The group, Probe Ministries of Dallas, has visited campuses from Vermont to Michigan to Louisiana. Eleven speakers were appearing at Louisiana Tech here this week. Probe Ministries was started by James F. Williams, a former official of another evangelical organization, who asserts that religious viewpoints are often banned from classes under the context of “freedom from religion, not freedom of religion.” The group has grown over the past six years to supplement other evangelical groups such as Campus Crusade for Christ and Inter‐Varsity Christian Fellowship. Varied Speaker Topics Mr. Williams, a trained classical tenor who has a master's degree from Dallas Theological Seminary, a major evangelical school, said, “I wanted to have a different effect on students, to reinforce what the other groups are doing.” With some financial support from Campus Crusade and other evangelical sources, he has prepared a list of “speaker topics” that include “the energy crisis, abortion, euthanasia, brain control, marriage: contract or commitment; ethics in government, the origin of science, the quest for the historical Jesus, business and ethics.” The aspirations of Probe is another example of the movement by evangelicals toward the mainstream of American life. There have been estimates of as many as 50 million evangelicals, who take their faith from the Scriptures and profess their belief in salvation through Christ. The main feature of Probe Ministries is an academic approach to religion. The speakers, most of whom say they hold advanced degrees from good colleges, make no attempt to preach or give witness of their faith. Concern at Vanderbilt Although they appear only at schools where they have permission from the administration, the speakers sometimes run into opposition. Earlier this year at Vanderbilt University, the Rev. Beverly Asbury, the Protestant chaplain, said their presence “may violat both the university's nonsectarian nature and the religious freedom and sensibilities of students who signed up for academic courses for academic reasons.” At Vanderbilt, only a third of the teachers who were approached gave permission to the Probe speakers. Meanwhile, Probe Ministries continues to offer its speakers at other campuses. The group was formed in 1973 by Mr. Williams, who had worked 12 years with Campus Crusade, a well‐financed nondenominational group in Arrowhead Springs, Calif., that has branches at more than 500 colleges. Before visiting a campus, Probe must be invited by a local committee, which usually adopts the name Christian Update. The group found an easy welcome in this isolated corner of northeast Louisiana. At Louisiana Tech, the director of the Campus Crusade group, Dub Rogers, asked permission from the academic dean, Virgil Orr. “This is Bible Belt country,” Dr. Orr said in an interview. “Most people expect a religious presence on campus. I was told these would not be religious speeches but talks given by people with a Christian viewpoint. I left it up to the instructor.” Many instructors, like Dr. Sue Westbrook of the English department, agreed to allow a speaker to take over a class. Dr. Westbrook, who has a doctorate in romantic literature from Vanderbilt, said she was eager for any outside influence that might stimulate her students. Speaking to Dr. Westbrook's freshman literature class, Mr. Williams, a short and stocky Texan with an enthusiastic manner, quoted from T.S. Eliot, Ber trand Russell and Sherwood Anderson to show elements of contemporary despair. He cited the mixing of animal and robot images with humans in the film “Star Wars” to demonstrate that “we are not sure who we are.” He said some people. explained life in terms of “naturalism, but that others believed in “supernaturalism.” He seemed to break down a life view into three areas: rational, irrational and anarchy, which he seemed to correlate with asking too many questions. After letting several speakers take over different classes, Dr. Westbrook said she was disappointed and “even a little deceived” by the content, feeling they had been vague and had not challenged the rural Baptist beliefs of her students. She agreed that the speakers had shied away from giving a specific religious message. Mr. Williams said later that he deliberately avoids the preacher‐type speaker who “might win the battle but lose the war” in a classroom, saying he wanted to “shed light, not heat.” He added that Probe would be judged on its intellectual contribution."
Abortion Snag Expected In State‐Budget Passage,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/02/archives/abortion-snag-expected-in-statebudget-passage-albany-notes.html,"ALBANY, April 1 — So pervasive is the ennui of this legislative session that the legislative leaders and Governor Carey's administration are, in effect, relying on it to break the budget impasse that is expected to develop this week over the use of Medicaid funds for abortions. As it now stands, the Legislature will begin tomorrow to debate and pass the various bills that comprise the state's $12.7 billion budget for the state fiscal year, which began today. The month late budget presentation — allowed after an election year —combined with the lethargy, caused the deadline for budget passage to slip by without a financial plan in place. After discovering last year that this could be done for at least a few days without grave consequences, everyone decided to take the weekend off rather than try to pass the budget on time. The snag is expected to arise when the Republican‐led Senate takes up the $7.5 billion local‐assistance budget, which provides money for schools, welfare, housing projects, health care —and Medicaid abortions. Senator James H. Donovan, a Republican‐Conservative of Chadwicks who is a vehement opponent of abortion, will try to amend the budget to insert language allowing the state to pay for abortions only when the life or physical health of the mother is seriously threatened, or in cases of rape or incest —language similar to the Federal Hyde Amendment. Current counts indicate that he will get 34 or 35 Senators to support him, four or five more than are needed to carry the amendment. Normally, a three‐day wait is required after an amendment before the bill can be voted on again. But the Senate leadership, prepared for the eventuality of an amendment, printed and introduced an alternative budget written to include the Donovan amendment, and it will be able to pass that and send it to the Assembly. In the Democratic‐led Assembly, the Speaker, Stanley Fink of Brooklyn, has said he expects the antiabortion amendment to fail. His house will pass the original, “clean” budget, and then the waiting will begin. According to those who want to keep the money in the budget, time and the lack of emotion that has characterized this session so far are their major weapons. Strategists say that while they believe that Mr. Donovan's commitment is such that he would hold out indefinitely, they expect that at least five or six Senators will “break” under the pressure of the local governments and, the more cynical ones suggest, of the legislative vacation scheduled for April 9 to 23. Nevertheless, all sides acknowledge that the vote counts are close, and surprises still are not being ruled out. But one aide to Governor Carey said: “Everyone is worn out from the heavy politics of last year. I just don't see the storm clouds — I don't see the passion.” • The recent battle for the Staten Island‐Manhattan Assembly seat vacated by Louis DeSalvio was the first big political test for Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink, and the victory of the Democratic candidate; Paul Viggiano, was boost. It wasn't luck. Aware of the consequences of a loss, a lot of Mr. Fink's staff members devoted a lot of time — their own, not the state's, they pointed out — to adding the son of the legendary district leader “Duke Viggiano” to the fold. Weekends saw at least one deputy counsel putting up posters on the Lower East Side. One staff member asserted, somewhat hyperbolically, that “the whole 19th floor,” the unit that handles “member services,” was working the 62d District. And the gruff voice answering the phone at headquarters on election night? It was none other than that of Tony Genovese, Mr. Fink's close adviser and chairman of the Commisson on Management and Productivity. • When a Republican legislator, Raymond McGrath of Valley Stream, L.I., introduced legislation protecting elephants recently, he left himself wide open — and a new Democratic Assemblywoman, May Newburger of Great Neck, L.I., took the shot. “We believe you can substitute the word Republican wherever you see the word elephant, as the elephant is the symbol of the Republican party,” she said in a mock press release. “We agree with Mr. McGrath that the Republican Party is an endangered species.” • “Is there anyone who feels they have to vote against this bill?” It was the standard question, posed by Senator Manfred Ohrenstein, the minority leader from Manhattan, to his Democratic caucus before the members went into session to vote on the New York City Convention Center—a project Mr. Ohrenstein has fought for for years. By prearranged signal, every hand went up. Mr. Ohrenstein went ashen and, according to those present, looked like he was about to faint. “It's a joke, it's a joke,” someone called. “There are some things you just don't joke about,” Mr. Ohrenstein said.

ALBANY DEADLOCKED ON ABORTION FUNDS,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/03/archives/albany-deadlocked-on-abortion-funds-senate-and-assembly-split.html,"ALBANY, Tuesday, April 3 — Passage of the state's $12.6 billion budget was blocked last night when the State Senate voted to eliminate Medicaid money to finance abortions for poor women and the Asssembly refused to do so. The adoption of the antiabortion amendment in one house but not the other created an impasse that will leave New York State - already in the third day of its new fiscal year‐without a budget for at least several days more. The state will be unable to pay some its bills, provide any aid to local governments or enter the credit markets for its mammoth $3 billion spring borrowing until it has one. After hours of searing debate, the Senate approved the antiabortion ammendment 33 to 26. The Assembly voted it down, 75 to 70, then wen on to defeat a handful of other amendments and finally passed the local‐assistance budget by a vote of 90 to 53 before adjourning. Early this morning, the Senate passed the localassistance budget, 38 to 21, approved the capital‐construction, debt‐service and judicial budgets, and then adjourned. The disagreement on abortion was the only sticking point as the Republican‐led Senate and the Democratic‐led Assembly reached accord on the other details of the budget, including increases of $185 million in state education aid and $87 million in localities that are assisted by revenuesharing. The budget also included major cuts in Governor Carey's proposals for Mental Health, correction and the judiciary. In addition, the legislative leadership quietly brought forward a last‐minute bill to raise the salaries of judges, top executive employees and legislators. However, the bill is not scheduled to be acted upon until at least later today. But the Medicaid‐abortion issue overshadowed all other considerations as the the Assembly and the Senate engaged in loud, lengthy and emotional debates over budget amendments that would bar Medicaid funding for abortions except in cases where the woman's life was in danger or in instances of rape or incest. As the Legislature worked early into the morning, it remained unclear how the impasse would be resolved, with both sides appearing willing to wait it out. But the closeness of the vote in the Senate —where 31 votes constitute a majority, and where an effort to convince. Senators to release the budget eventually succeeded last year — suggested that pressure would be concentrated there. Antiabortion lobbyists said they believed they had a chance of succeeding in the Assembly, but this seemed less likely. The debate reflected the strength of feeling on the question, which last year left the state without a budget for nearly a week. “Will this government go on financing the killing of its future citizens? It's as simple as that,” said Senator James H. Donovan, Republican‐Conservative of Chadwicks and the leading Senate sponsor of the antiabortion amendment. “They seem to know the cost of everything and the value of nothing,” Mr. Donovan said of advocates of Medicaidabortion financing. “God help us if we don't turn this thing around soon, because the anti‐life people have conquered the nursery and perhaps the next step is the geriatric ward.” “Is it their right to foist upon those of us who disagree with their doctrine of what is and what isn't life?” replied Senator Roy M. Goodman, a Manhattan Republican. “Let us rise at this time and defeat this vicious amendment,” which he said constituted “cruel and inhuman punishment for poor women.” Overall, the budget was somewhat smaller than the one Mr. Carey had proposed and was finally agreed to last week after six weeks of grueling negotiations. It included the following key provisions. $186 million increase in aid to school districts around the state. The increase was $20 million less than Mr. Carey had proposed, but provided that no district in the state will lose operating aid. Mr. Carey had asked for a package that would have shifted funds from rich to poor districts, and left some of the state's wealthier districts with no state aid at all. The new package placated the wealthy districts that saw their aid returned, but enraged some poorer districts. These districts — whose legislators tried unsuccessfully to amend the budget bills last night — will receive increases under the plan, but less than Mr. Carey wanted to give them. Mr. Carey won half a loaf in his fight to reduce state revenue sharing aid to localities — the least restrictive form of assistance. On the one hand, the Legislature restored $87 million Mr. Carey wanted to take away from local governments. But under a new formula, the revenue‐sharing pool will grow much more slowly in the future. Among the most serious cuts made in the budget were reductions affecting the Department of Mental Hygiene — which got $31 million less than Mr. Carey had asked for — along with the Division for Youth, which saw its budget reduced by $5.6 million, to $47.8 million, and the Department of Correction. Proposed Pay Raises The legislative, executive and judicial pay raises were not expected to be considered until later in the year. The proposed raises would give legislators an eventual increase of about 40 percent, from $23,500 a year to 32,960 by Jan. 1, 1983. However, the legislators’ increases would not go into effect until 1981. The Governor had proposed that the executive pay raises be linked to legislation requiring strict financial disclosure. Such legislation will not be taken up until later in the legislative session — if at all. The pay raises for 115 top‐executive employees and for all state judges except for those at the town and village level involve a 7 percent increase retrocatctive to last October, and 7 percent this coming October. Judges would receive an additional 3.5 percent by October 1980, and county and city judges would receive an additional increase to bring them into line with other members of the judiciary."

Pay Increases Are Voted for Legislators and Judges,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/04/archives/pay-increases-are-voted-for-legislators-and-judges-albany-votes.html,"ALBANY, April 3— The New York State Legislature voted pay increases tonight for legislators, judges and top executive employees as it completed action on major remaining pieces of the state's 1979‐80 budget. But the largest share of the state's spending ‐ the $7.5 billion local‐assistance budget ‐ remained snared In a disagreement over the use of Medicaid funds to pay for abortions. With not a word of debate, the Assembly approved the pay‐increase bill by a• vote of 89 to 58. After arguments in support of the bill from the Republican majority leader and the Democratic minority leader, the Senate voted for it, 42 to 17. “There has been a brain drain from the Legislature,” said Senator Manfred Ohrenstein, the minority leader and a Manhattan Democrat, in arguing that low pay had forced qualified legislators back into the private sector. The pay increases, which are expected to be approved by Governor Carey, would increase legislators’ salaries from $23,500 to $32,960 by 1983. They would receive an increase in their daily allowance immediately — to $55 from $40— but would not actually see their pay go up until January 1981, when the next Legislature takes office. The state's constitution prohibits a sitting Legislature from raising its own Pay. Under the legislation passed tonight, judges and the state's top executives would get an increase of 14 percent —7 percent retroactive to last October, and another 7 percent this October. All judges would receive an additional 3.5 percent increase in October 1980, and city, county and village judges would receive even larger increases, to bring their salaries into line with those of other members of the judiciary. Among the other measures approved today was the state's capital construction budget, and the state purposes budget. The capital construction budget includes major cuts from Mr. Carey's proposals, includlng a $27.5 cut for a 512‐bed state prison. Mr. Carey had asked for $55 million to build two prisons, but the Legislatйre approved only one. During the day, the Assembly and Senate beat back a variety of amendments, including those that would increase spending for the Division for Youth, to stop a tuition increase at the State University, and to fight alleged discriminadon by banks in the awarding of mortgage loans. In each house, the dominant party —the Democrats in the Assembly and the Republicans in the Senate — spent the day voting against politically popular, but expensive, amendments put forward by the opposition party in an effort to store up ammunition for the 1980 elections. “Campaign ‘80 has begun,” said Senator Frank Padavan, a Republican‐Conservative of Jamaica, Queens, just before the Senate Republicans beat back Democratic amendment to stop the State University tuition increase, scheduled go into effect this fall. In the Assembly, the Democratic majority was forced vote against a similar proposal put forth by Republicans. The pay raises had been recommended by a panel appointed by Mr. Carey and legislative leaders, but Mr. Carey had urged that they be linked toIegislation requiring state officials to make detailed disclosures of their financial affairs. Lobbyists for disclosure legislation said they feared that passage of the pay raise now would doom a disclosure bill. “With pay raises passing right now, there's no incentive to pass the diclosure bill,” said Iris Weinshall, associate director of Citizens Union, a public‐interest lobbying group. Partisans on both sides said that serious negotiations on the abortion question would not begin until the rest of the budget had been approved by late today or early tomorrow. Pressure is expected to be concentrated on the Senate, where enough opponents of abortion relented last year to permit final passage of the budget. A key Senator opposed to abortion who asked not to be identified predicted that much the same thing would happen again. Governor Carey, who favors the use Medicaid funds for abortions, asked that the Legislature “not hold hostage all the local assistance programs that are part of that package.” “Не shares responsibility for this impasse,” said Senator James H. Donovan, a Republican‐Conservative of Chadwicks and the sponsor of the antiabortion amendment, of Mr. Carey's role, “because I served notice on him months ago that this would happen. He did nothing to avoid it.” The state's budget was snarled last night when the Senate approved and the Assembly voted down an amendment barring the use of Medicaid funds to pay for abortions except where the woman's life was in danger, or in cases of rape or incest. The budget cannot become law until both houses approve identical versions. Although the state is in the third day of its fiscal year without a budget, legislators and aides — aware that the state went nearly a week last year before passing a budget, without any apparent ill effects — took the delay calmly, almost lethargically, and predicted that something would be worked out by Friday, so the Legislature's two‐week vacation could begin."

Albany Leaders Unable to Settle Budget Impasse,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/05/archives/albany-leaders-unable-to-settle-budget-impasse-regan-explains.html,"ALBANY, April 4 — Legislative leaders failed tonight to resolve the impasse that has left. New York State without budget foi four days as the Republicancontrolled State Senate met briefly and adjourned until tomorrow morning. The Assembly, which is controlled by the Democrats, followed suit a short time later. The failure to resolve the budget stalemate — over whether Medicaid &rids should be used to pay for abortions came as the state's Comptroller, Edward V. Regan, warned that any further delays could raise interest costs on New York State's huge spring borrowing. Earlier in the day, Senator James H. Donovan, the leading sponsor of the amendment to cut off the use of Medicaid funds to pay for abortions in most cases, and the Senate majority leader, Warren M. Anderson of Binghamton had little to say after a meeting with the Governor and other legislative leaders. “He's the leader,” said Mr. Donovan, a Republican of Chadwicks, pointing to Mr. Anderson as the two men walked dosyn a hallway to a meeting of Senate Republicans. “No comment, nothing,” said Mr. Andersoh.. In an effort to step up the pressure for budget passage, the Carey administration cut off $20 million in payments under the state's Medicaid Management Information’ System. The administration is hoping that doctors and other who will have‐their payments delayed will press their Senators to abandon the effort to cut off Medicaid abortion financing and release the budget. As the Republicans conferred, the Assembly approved Governor Carey's pro‘posal that would use limited rent increases and low interest “loans” to rescue the financially troubled MitchellLama hoUsing program for middleincome people. The vote was 84 to 59. But the bill appeared to have little chance in the Senate. Meanwhile, Comptroller Regan said that any further delays in approval of the budget might raise interest costs for the state's $3 billion spring borrowing. Regan Explains Problem “As of today, we have negotiated remarkably favorable rates,” Mr. Regan said. “If the budget is delayed, further prospective customers of. our notes may begin to invest their money elsewhere and interest rates will have to be raised to sell the notes.” The state is scheduled to make its annual spring borrwing — through which it raises money to pay school aid and other local assistance — by April 16. But Mr. Regan said the state could afford no further delays, because it must complete a variety of actions before then. In addition, the state's Commissioner of Social Services, Barbara B. Blum, warned that further delays could prevent the state from meeting its Medicaid payments. The state's $7.5 billion local‐assistance budget was tied up Monday night, when the Senate approved and the Assembly voted down an amendment that would • bar the use of Medicaid funds to pay for abortions except when a woman's life was in danger and in cases of rape or incest. Although the meeting among the principals and Governor Carey, who favors Medicaid payments for abortions, did not immediately resolve the dispute, partisans on both sides of the issue predicted the budget would ultim'ately be allowed to pass by Senators opposed to Medicaid payments for abortions, but fearful of the effects of a long budget delay. The Mitchell‐Lama bill, which would apply to all the Mitchell‐Lama developments — the 169 built by New York City and the 266 built by the state — would allow rent increases of up to 12 percent in housing projects where rents did not provide enough income to cover costs. It would fill any additional financial gaps with money from a “revolving loan fund,” which would be offered at a 3 percent interest rate."

Right to Life Party's Gain,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/05/archives/right-to-life-partys-gain-antiabortion-groups-showing-in-recent.html,"The New York State Conservative Party, created as a counter to the oncepredominant relative liberalism of the two major parties, now faces its most serious threat not from the left but from the right Ȅ the newly formed Right to Life Party. News Analysis The potential impact of the new party, which is devoted solely to opposing abortion, was embarrassingly evident to the Conservatives in the March 21 special Assembly election in the 62d District, covering lower Manhattan and a slice of Staten Island. In the party's first appearance on a formal ballot line, it had teamed up with the Conservatives to support James Molinaro, the Staten Island Conservative chairman. To the surprise of most politicians, it produced more votes for Mr. Molinaro in both ends of the district than his own Conservative Party. He drew 902 votes on the Right to Life line and 768 on the Conservative line. The Democrat, Paul Viggiano, won as expected, and the Republican candidate. obviously losing hundreds of votes to the Conservative and Right to Life Party, ran last. But in a further embarrassment to the Conservatives, the Liberal Party, their natural political enemy, placed second. The Liberals, recovering from their fifth‐place finish in last year's race for Governor, were the only party to run ahead of their tally in the regular Assembly election last year, but the Right to Lifers did not have a candidate then. The Wider Importance The significance of the contest, however, transcends that small electoral arena. The results, politicians of all parties agreed, signaled that the new party, with its narrow focus on an emotional issue, would siphon votes from the Republican, Democratic and Conservative Parties, but that the smaller Conservative Party could least afford any thinning of its ranks. “The Right to Life Party will do to the Conservative Party what the reform Democrats did to the Liberal Party,” said Vincent F. Albano, the Manhattan Republican chairman. That Democratic movement, now having its own problems, attracted many young persons who would have been potential Liberal Party recruits, particularly during the ferment against the Vietnam War. “We can't just say it's going to go away,” Dr. Bernard Kilbourn, the Republican state chairman, said of the Right to Life Party. Republican candidates, he said, “are going to have to try to get their endorsements, but it's a very restrictive mold Ȅ there's little flexibility.” Only the Conservatives, as a matter of state party policy, join the Right to Life Party in opposing abortion. An admittedly embarrassed Serphin R. Maltese, executive director of the Conservative Party and its Queens leader, said he thought the statewide maximum for the Right to Life Party would be about 200,000 votes. That would be 75,000 more than the anti‐abortion splinter party received last November for its first candidate, Mary Jane Tobin, who polled enough votes to qualify it as an official political party. It even ran ahead of the Liberal Party, which had endorsed Governor Carey. Conservatives’ Earlier Strength Mr. Maltese noted that his party, seemingly a fixture on the state scene after 17 years, had polled as many as two million votes (for James L. Buckley's Senate candidacy in 1970), although a more normal vote is a quarter of that figure or less. “It could be embarrassing, but I like to think it will inspire our people to get working,” he said, adding that he had criticized members of his Queens executive committee for failing to volunteer their services in the special election. Mr. Maltese and other Conservative leaders met in Hicksville, L.I., earlier last month with their Right to Life counterparts to discuss future cooperation. Two potential areas of cooperation are in the state legislative and United States Senate campaigns next year. Mr. Maltese noted that all but a handful of the Republican legislators whom the Conservatives endorsed last year opposed abortion and thus would be likely to get the Right to Life Party's endorsement. Similarly, Representative Jack Kemp of Buffalo, the Conservatives’ preference for the United States Senate next year Ȅ although he is not an announced candidate yet Ȅ is anti‐abortion and thus presumably acceptable to the Right to Life Party. Although cooperation between the two parties is likely, the key question to many politiciaris is whether the Conservatives, with their broader‐based philosophy one that has been at least partly embraced by the major parties Ȅ can resist encroachments by the one‐issue Right to Life group, and whether one party will swallow the other. Many politicians questioned whether even New York State's many‐hued political spectrum has room for two strong ideological parties on the right. Thirty years ago there was not enough room on the left when that persuasion was more fashionable and the Liberal and American Labor Parties had to compete for the support of liberal voters. Political history has a way of repeating itself."
Anti‐Abortion Ploy in Albany,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/05/archives/antiabortion-ploy-in-albany.html,"Eighteen states have joined the Federal Government in denying public funds to poor women who choose to have legal abortions. Now a coalition of abortion foes, led by Senator James Donovan from upstate New York, is employing an unusual tactic in an effort to add the state to the list. We deplore both the maneuver and the objective. Since Monday, the Donovan coalition has held the state's new budget hostage, trying to force the Legislature to accept an amendment that would sharply restrict state financing of abortions. The Senate’ agreed, by a close margin, to end Medicaid funding except when a woman's life or health is in danger or when she Ls the victim of rape or incest. The Assembly, also by close vote, rejected the amendment. Each side now waits for the other to cave in. As long as the deadlock persists, the state will be prevented from doing normal business. By pressing the amendment during the yearly budget rush, the foes of abortion hoped to foreclose debate and evade a veto by Governor Carey. The Governor opposes the amendment, but his veto of such provision in a budget bill might be challenged in court. Even in a more reasonably managed debate, however, we would vigorously oppose this measure to punish the poor. New York has been a pioneer in developing the right to abortion for all women, rich and poor, whenever they and their doctors think it necessary. Now that the Federal Government has moved to diminish this right for poor women, New York's policy more necessary. Washington's restrictive rules have reduced Federally financed abortions by a remarkable 99 percent. The foes of abortion well understand that cutting off state funds around the country will now frustrate the hard‐won legal right of poor women. The supporters of free choice for women need to resist Mr. Donovan's ploy."
A Grasso Choice For Schools Post Beaten in Senate,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/05/archives/a-grasso-choice-for-schools-post-beaten-in-senate-mrs-hudak-the.html,"Mrs. Hudak, the Nominee, Opposes Sex EducationHARTFORD, April 4 — In the first defeat for Gov. Ella T. Grasso in her second term of office, the State Senate refused today to confirm her nomination of Eva Hudak for the State Board of Education. The 24‐to‐12 vote came after two and half hours of heated discussion. Also, by a vote of 19 to 17, the Senate passed a bill banning discrimination against homosexuals. Renamed the Sexual Status bill and expanded to include ban on housing and job discrimination against unmarried couples, the proposal now awaits action by the House of Representatives. If the bill is finally enacted, Connecticut would become the first state in the country to adopt such a measure, although many cities have banned discrimination against homsexuals. The Connecticut House has refused to pass similar legislation in the past. In the fight over the confirmation of Mrs. Hudak, politics, religion and personalities all contributed. The Board of Education is a nine‐member policy panel, and one of Mrs. Hudak's supporters, Senator David M. Barry, Democrat of Manchester, declared that one new voice would “hardly be a threat to the academic and education role of our state.” Opponent of Sex Education The 62‐year‐old Mrs. Hudak is one of the state's most outspoken opponents of sex education in the schools, the Equal Rights Amendment and abortion, and strong campaign against her was mounted by the major education organizations in the state and by feminists and other forces favoring women's right to choice in abortion. Many opponents who characterized Mrs. Hudak as “divisive” and “obstructionist” said they did not object to her views but to the way she pressed them. Mrs. Grasso left Hartford today before the vote, but issued a statement saying: “It is my beliefthat it will take rare courage, in view of this protracted debate, for others to consider appointment.” Mrs. Hudak, who sat quietly watching the debate in the packed Senate gallery, later said she thought “it was a fair vote, everyone voted their own conscience and now it's up to the people to judge them.” Senator Richard F. Schneller, Democrat of Essex and former chairman of the Education Committee, called Mrs. Hudak a “decent person,” but said she did not have the education or background to qualify as a member of the Board of Education. Mrs. Hudak dropped out of school at the age of 14 during the Depression to help support her family. She recently passed a high‐school equivalency test."

The newspaper staff was evicted by the university Tuesday and produced today's and yesterday's editions at the facilities of•The Charlottesville Daily Progress, the local commercial newspaper. Hundreds of students demonstrated on campus earlier today to protest the university's eviction of the newspaper staff. It was the first demonstration this year at the school and the largest since 1967. As part of the agreement, The Cavalier Daily announced its intention to become independent of the administration by Aug. 30. The university agreed to participate in negotiations toward this end and for the sale of equipment and leasing of campus office space. The question of whether the newspaper was required to print letters of censure written by the media board was resolved in the newspaper's favor when the university's counsel told the editors that the media board's Constitution did not require it. • Power Is Cut Off in Florida By Dust and Dry Weather MIAMI, April 5 (AP) — A freakish combination of dry weather and dust fouled transmission lines and cut off power in much of Florida, affecting at least 100,000 people in the Miami area before the damage was repaired this morning. Tony Bruns, a spokesman for Florida Power and Light Company, said that fire departments “all over south Florida” were spraying water on transmission lines in an effort to cleanse them of salt and dust accumulations. “Rain wouldn't hurt either,” he added. Problems with the lines and the insulators that keep the power from draining off caused lights to flicker and television pictures to shrink through much of Florida last night. At least 100,000 people in the Miami area and thousands more in the Fort Lauderdale, Belle Glade, Tampa‐St. Petersburg, Winter Haven and Daytona Beach areas and elsewhere lost power at some point during the night. Power was restored to virtually all the affected areas by 9 A.M. today, Mr. Bruns said. Cancer Society Chief Urges Marijuana Use to Ease Pain LOS ANGELES, April 5 (AP) — The president of the American Cancer Society says doctors should be able to use marijuana as a last resort to relieve the harsh side‐effects of some cancer therapies. “The physician who is treating patients with cancer should have everything at his disposal and be able to use it if it will help,” Dr. LaSalle D. Leffall Jr. said in an interview this week. Referring to marijuana, he said, “The evidence does support the fact that it can help the patient.” That conclusion is supported by a growing body of scientific research and a long history of informal, and illegal, use of the drug by many cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The Federal Government, however, still classifies marijuana, along with heroin, LSD and other drugs, as a Schedule substance: No medical value and high potential for abuse. The cancer society's official position, adopted last year, says only that marijuana has promise and warrants more “controlled clinical trials,” a spokesman said. Since 1978, at least half a dozen legislatures have passed state laws allowing doctors to prescribe marijuana for some chemotherapy patients. Such programs usually are described officially as research and require case‐by‐case review by a medical board. Similar measures are generating controversy in other states, including California. Charges Over Boston Fires Sought Against Hotel Chiefs BOSTON, April 5 (UPI) — Boston's Fire Commissioner, George Paul, has asked the Suffolk County District Attorney to seek criminal negligence complaints against managers of the Sheraton‐Boston hotel for not setting off fire alarms in last Thursday's pre‐dawn blaze. The First Assistant District Attorney, Paul K. Leary, said yesterday that an investigation would be conducted before any decision about prosecution was made. “The evacuation alarm at the Sheraton was not sounded, in violation of state law,” Commissioner Paul said. “I'm not a lawyer, but it appears to me there was violation of the law and that complaints should be sought.” More than 1,800 people staying at the Copley Plaza and Sheraton‐Boston hotels had to flee their rooms a week ago as series of fires struck the hotels.

STATE BUDGET VOTED AS ALBANY APPROVES I AID FOR ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/06/archives/state-budget-voted-as-albany-approves-aid-for-abortions-action-on.html,"ALBANY, Friday, April 6 — The New York State Senate approved the final piece of a $12.6 billion state budget early this morning, ending a bitter battle over whether Medicaid funds should be used to pay for abortions for poor women. The vote was 33 to 23. The budget that was finally approved by exhausted Senators includes Medicaid funds to pay for abortions. Last Monday, the Senate approved a budget that would have cut off the abortion funds. That action set in motion a budget impasse that had threatened to raise the state's interest rates and frustrate, its ability to send aid to school districts and localities. The Senate vote came only after a lengthy, closed meeting of Republican Senators, during which the Senate majority leader, Warren M. Anderson, pleaded with his colleagues — most of whom oppose Medicaid‐abortion financing — to allow a budget to pass. Local Assistance Budget Passage of the $7.5 billion local assistance budget, which covers the largest part of the state's spending, became a possibility last night, when Mr. Anderson, a Binghamton Republican, and the Speaker of the Assembly, Stanley Fink, a Brooklyn Democrat, agreed to bring the conflicting versions of the state's budget to the floors of their houses. The Assembly, which had voted on Monday for a budget that included the Medicaid funds, acted first. In a roll‐call vote that ended last night at 9:30 P.M., rejected the Senate's antiabortion budget after a short debate. The vote was 74 to 58. Under the agreement between the Mr. Fink and Mr. Anderson, it fell to the,Senate to try to pass the Assembly document including the abortion funds. Looking tired but cheerful after his colleagues stistained his position in favor of the Medicaid financing, Mr. Fink said Mr. Anderson had called him after the Assembly vote and said: “Now the job's up to me.” But the task before Mr. Anderson was formidable, and it took him hours to convince a sufficient number of his Republican colleagues to support the Assembly budget to get it enacted. When it was all over, advocates of Medicaid abortion jubilant. But abortion opponents vented their anger at the process through which their efforts to bar abortion financing were foiled. “The whole scenario is a charade,” said Assemblyman Roger Robach, a Democrat‐Conservative of Rochester and an abortion foe who predicted that the abortion issue would come up again. “It's going to be here every year. The cast if characters might change, but it's going to be an issue.” With the eactment of the budget, the state's massive spring borrowing, which the state uses to pay school and local aid, seemed secure. Earlier this week, the State Comptroller, Edward V. Regan, a Republican, who said that delays in adopting the budget would endanger the favorable interest rate he had obtained on the $3 billion spring borrowing, money the state uses to pay aid to school districts. The events followed a day in which lobbyists and legislators on both sides of the abortion issue killed time by wandering through hallways exchanging gossip, confused looks and knowing glances as legislative leaders met privately to try to iron things out. “It's such a crazy time because all you can do is find out what everyone knows,” said Rosalyn Udow, director of policy affairs for the Planned Parenthood Association. “And,” she added,“nobody knows anything,” “Nobody knows anything other than what's bouncing off the walls,” added an antiabortion lobbyist who asked not to be named. While they waited for a solution to the budget problem, the two houses of the Legislature met to grind through a series of bills. Brooklyn Hospital Bill One of the bills approved by both houses was a $2.2 million plan to keep the bankrupt Brooklyn Jewish Hospital open for two to three months, pending agreement on a broader plan to keep the hospital afloat. Passage of the bill would end months of erratic negotiations designed to save the BedfordStuyvesant facility, which only yesterday appeared on the verge of closing. “It will give us enough time to set up a meaningful financial plan for the hospital,” said Assemblyman Alan G. Hevesi, a Forest Hills Democrat. Besides providing new funds for the hospital, the bill also provides a 5 percent increase in the reimbursement rates to hospitals for outpatient care and removes the ceiling on the amount hospitals would be reimbursed for capital and equipment costs. These provisions were in part an effort to win Republican support for the measure, which was avidly sought by Governor Carey, who is expected to sign it today. Overall, the bill would cost the state an estimated $5.2 million. Pay Checks Delayed On the very day that the hospital was being saved, its workers’ pay checks were being held up by the dispute here over Medicaid abortions. According to Judy Berek, legislative Director for District 1199 of the hospital workers’ union, delays in Medicaid payments because of the budget deadlock stopped paychecks at the hospital. In other legislative action, the Senate approved a bill designed to protect New York City and its suburbs from over $2 billion in property tax claims from industrial and commercial land owners who bring suit under court decisions which have declared New York's three‐tier system of assessment illegal. The system provides, lower assessment for homeowners, and thus means that owner of business property pay higher taxes. The complicated bill — sponsored by Senator John J. March!, a Staten Island Republican, strongly backed by New York City, and given a good chance of passing the Assembly — would make it more difficult for business property owners to press their claims. The Assembly approved a bill providing the state's Banking Department with $180,000 to enforce a ban on geographic discrimination in mortgage loans by banks. But the proposal is expected to be scuttled by the Senate, which refused to include the anti‐redlining funds in the state budget."

FULL REDUCTION BY ‘81 ASKED,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/07/archives/albany-leadership-seeks-a-cut-to-10-for-top-tax-level-full.html,"ALBANY, April 6 — The leaders of the New York State Assembly and. Senate agreed today to propose a reduction in the state's maximum income‐tax rate, just hours after the. Legislature finally ap.. proved the last part of the state's $12.6 billion budget. Special to The New York Times The two leaders, the Speaker of the Assembly, Stanley Fink, a Brooklyn Democrat, and the Senate majority leader, Warren M. Anderson, Republican of Binghamton, also called for an increase in the state's tax credit for low‐income people who must pay high property taxes. In addition, they recommended unspecified reductions in the sales tax. Talks on Note Sale The announcement came as the state neared the end of negotiations on its $3.1 billion spring borrowing, with New York winning an interest rate on its tax‐exempt bonds of 6.109 percent, according to Gedale Horowitz, a senior partner at the brokerage concern of Salomon Brothers who is managing the state's note sale. Although the rate is higher than the 5.079 percent the state paid last year, the increase of one percentage point was regarded as a favorable sign by investors and by the State Comptroller, Edward V. Regan, since the state's rate rose much more slowly than the rates Charged on other tax‐exempt bonds. “What has happened,” Mr. Horowitz explained, “is that the investor acceptance of the state's credit is so far superior than it was.” He added that the perception among purchasers of bonds was that state officials had “put their house in order.” Regan Is Encouraged Mr. Regan said the borrowing rate was “a superb, not conclusive, but very excellent sign” that the state had returned to the fiscal condition it was in before the financial troubles experienced by New York City and the Urban Development Corporation. “All in all, it's a very good sign, and we're hahpy,” Mr. Regan said. In a joint statement, Mr. Anderson and Speaker Fink called for a cut in the state's maximum 12 percent income‐tax rate, which applies to those who earn more than $19,000 a year. Under their plan, the rate would become 11 percent effective on Jan. 1, 1980. It would be reduced to 10 percent on Jan. 1, 1981. The cut had been sought by Governor Carey as part of the 1979.80 budget, but the Legislature balked at including it, fearing that the state would face a budget gap next year. Should the plan proposed by Mr. Fink and Mr. Anderson become law, most of the effects of the proposed reduction are not expected to be felt until next year or later. Under the plan — which would cut income taxes $80 million to $90 million in the first year, and twice that in 1981, according to the two leaders — a taxpayer with a family of four'and an annual income of $35,000 would see his state taxes drop from $3,270 in 1979 to $3,000 in 1981. The two leaders also proposed that the Legislature's fiscal committees “make recommendations” toward “narrowing” the coverage of the state's sales tax and expanding the state's real‐property tax “circuit breaker” credit, through which the state offers state income‐tax relief or direct cash payments to taxpayers whose property taxes rise above a certain point. The circuit breaker tax credit currently applies only to the low‐income elderly. The way for the spring borrowing and the legislative leaders’ tax‐cut announcement was cleared today at 1:52 A.M., when weary senators approved a local assistance budget that included Medicaid funds to finance abortions for poor women. On Monday, the Republican‐led Senate passed a budget cutting off the abortion aid, and the Democratic‐led Assembly passed a version that included the aid, creating a stalemate that lett the state without a budget for six days. The Senate finally relented after the Assembly agreed to consider the Senate's antiabortion budget last night and quickly voted it down, 74 to 58. That set the stage for an emotional, three‐hour meeting of Republican senators, most of whom opposed Medicaid abortion financing. In the end, Senator Anderson managed to persuade enough of his colleagues to vote for the Assembly budget to get it through on a vote of 33 to 23 — only two more votes than the 31 it needed to become law. The early‐morning debate on the issue in the Senate reflected the exhaustion that had set in. “It serves no 13 urpose to pursue the fight at this time,’ said Senator James H. Donovan, a Republican‐Conservative of Chadwicks and the leading sponspor of the antiabortion amendment, in announcing that he had relented and would not force further budget delays. “Now it's time that we get on to other business.” But other abortion foes refused to relent. In the Assembly, Assemblyman Roger Robach, a Democrat‐Conservative of Rochester and a leading opponent of abortion, denounced the process through which the budget had been passed as “a charade” and criticized Senator Dona van's tactics. Supporters of abortion were generally quiet during the debate, though Senator Vander L. Beatty, a Brooklyn Democrat, denouned the role of a “small little jive party called the Right to Life Party,” the antiabortion group that won 130,000 votes for its gubernatorial candidate in November. Passage of the budget, according to Mr. Horowitz, came just in time to avoid hurting the state in its spring borrowing. “If there had been no budget today,” he said, “boy, we would have been in a lot of trouble.” The state's 1 percent increase in borrowing costs compared favorably with increases on other bonds, according to market analysts. For example, the interest rate on Project Notes issued by the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development — the rate that is regarded by investors as the premiere credit in the short term tax‐exempt market — has gone up more than 11/2 percent over the last year. The key short‐term market indicator, the Federal funds rate — the rate at which banks make loans to each other—rose by more than three points in the same period."

NONFICTION IN BRIEF,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/08/archives/nonfiction-in-brief.html,"Herbert Benson is a well-respected Harvard medicine man who has become famous through his identification of the so‐called “relaxation re- sponse,” achieved generally through meditative techniques and practices. In “The Mind/ Body Effect” he deals with what is probably the most important shift in modern medicine in America — the move away from technology and toward a more “holistic” approach. Books, seminars and papers are currently being produced prolifically on the subject by many experts in health and psychology. Stanley Reiser's book, “Medicine and the Reign of Technology,” is perhaps the most notable, but it is largely a specialized field. Dr. Benson tries to bring an advanced conceptual problem down to the level of you and me. THE MIND/BODY EFFECT By Herbert Benson, M.D. 190 pp. New York: Simon and Schuster. $8.95. His book is brief, with short sentences, short words and short chapters. His examples are careful and to the point. His illustrations and diagrams are helpful. His technical language is kept to a minimum. His most lengthy discussion concerns the placebo effect, which is really the ultimate expression of what he calls Behavioral Medicine (a kind of family therapy for the body), and what he asks is that people depend less on doctors, drugs and the idea of “perfect” health, and instead face the reality of imperfect bodies and imperfect minds inextricably connected What is striking about these instructions is that they should be necessary. He makes us sound like children, demanding everlasting life and doctors to achieve it for us. Has modern medicine led Americans so far into insecurity and dependence? If so, Dr. Benson's book is not only aimed at the right readers but is vital to their future wellbeing. WOMAN'S PROPER PLACE A History of Changing Ideals and Practices, 1870 to the Present. By Sheila M. Rothman. 322 pp. New York: Basic Books. $12.50. Is it possible that there are aspects of the women's movement that remain undocumented? Sheila M. Rothman has indeed found a new approach, and it is a stimulating one. She traces the rise of American women's involvement with suffrage, liberation and women's rights generally, through American social policy. She examines the concept of “virtuous womanhood” in postCivil War America in terms of women's health — women were regarded as not physically up to the strains of higher education. She examines the model of Vassar (the first women's college In the United States), comparing the daily routine of students to the ways that “medical superintendents of the Jacksonian asylum administered institutions to cure the insane” rather than as an institution of higher learning. Mrs. Rothman traces the calculated shift of authority over the health of children from nurses and educated mothers to medical specialists (male, of course) in the 1910's and 1920's, leaving women once again helpless to control what had been their most obvious realm of interest. She also points to the failure of protective legislation to help the very women it was trying to protect — in heavy industrial jobs, for instance. She analyzes today's issues — abortion, the Equal Rights Amendment, job discrimination — so that one sees with a historical perspective what a discrepancy lies between the aims and hopes of women and the social policy that affects them. It is a chasand FAMILY SECRETS The Experience of Emotional Crisis. By Mel Roman and Sara Blackburn. 158 pp. New York: Times Books. $10.95. Mel Roman and Sara Blackburn examired in depth seven case histories of psychological disturbance. Their book suggests that the most useful treatment in specific cases— and for most people unless diagnosed as genuinely psychotic — is some form of family therapy (as opposed to individual therapy). “As Jong as the family remains the arena in which we first learn, truly or falsely, our own identities, it will be the family past and present we grapple with in our never-ending transition into the world beyond it,” write the authors. This seems to me to make eminently good sense, and the book in general is full of sensible observations, in contrast to the flood of psychobabble we have been subjected to lately. This is a highly specialized book, to be sure. “Family Secrets,” in spite of its titillating title, is not a jolly, voyeuristic tale to while away an evening. It is an important plea to professionals to consider using family therapy more frequently. The case histories, all of which are well and sensitively described, effectively illustrate the authors’ point of view. There is also an imaginative, nonsectarian reading list at the end. In the last part of the book the authors quote a family therapist, Marianne Walters, whose work they evidently admire: “The point of therapy,” she says, is to get unhooked, not to thrash around on how you got hooked.” Every shrink in New York should have that engraved in marble over his or her couch. HUSBANDS AND WIVES A Nationwide Survey of Marriage. By Anthony Pietropinto, M.D. and Jacqueline Simenauer. 408 pp. New York: Times Books. $12.50. Experienced survey‐readers will tell you that the only parts really worth reading are the summarized findings, which are usually the shortest, most concisely written, interesting and useful portions of the whole effort. Anthony Pietropinto and Jacqueline Simenauer present the findings of their nationwide survey of marriage in their introduction to this 408‐page book - six pages on the reasons people marry, mate selection, the marriage relationship, children in marriage, fighting in marriage, infidelity, divorce, remarriage, life styles and the future of marriage. The rest of their enormous book is devoted to quotes from responses to their questionnaire, which makes very unexciting reading. In “Beyond the Male Myth,” the same authors found new nuggets in some wellmined territory. In “Husbands and Wives,” the all-too-familiar dissatisfactions with sex, jobs and communication are trotted out once again and repeated over and over when one example would surely do. As in all such samples, the people are one‐dimensional, characterized only by age group, education and job status. The authors try to pep it all up by injecting essays on Aristotle, George Bernard Shaw, ancient marriage and doesn't help the essential tedium of plowing through hundreds of unremarkable observations from nameless sources. In the last three pages, however, something happens. The authors urge that people forget the idea that marriage is a vehicle for personal fulfillment that can be overthrown at the drop of a hat. They ask us to remember that marriage is for families, not couples, and that a good marriage is “work accomplished, the respect of partners for one another, and the undying commitment to the life they have chosen to share.” I wish that they had simply taken a few case histories, as the authors of “Family Secrets” did, to illustrate these interesting conclusions — instead, they are lost in a mass of anonymous responses.■"
Center Stage: A New Crop Of Senators,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/08/archives/connecticut-weekly-center-stage-a-new-crop-of-senators-some.html,"HARTFORD LAST Tuesday, State Senator Eugene A. Skowronski, a freshman Democrat from Derby, was fairly clear about how he would vote on the first big controversies of the 1979 General Assembly — yes on homosexual rights (“a matter of conscience”) and yes on the nomi- nation of Eva Hudak to the State Board of Education. Mrs. Hudak, the Senator believed, was being “castigated unfairly” for her conservative views on abortion and sex education. The next day, Mr. Skowronski sat in the Senate chamber, listened to five hours of debate, and voted — no on Eva Hudak, and no on homosexual rights. The decisions by Senator Skowronski and his colleagues were being closely.watched by the politicians, bureaucrats and lobbyists in the state capital. The Senate, with its large contingent of freshmen, had been untested until now. The votes last week hint that the chamber may be more liberal and independent than it has been in the past. They may also suggest problems for Gov. Ella T. Grasso during her second term. “People may be feeling she's a lame duck,” said Representative Gardner Wright, Bristol Democrat. Mr. Wright, the Appropriations Committee chairman, soon will be introducing a state budget, which, by Mrs. Grasso's request, will be austere. “If they think she's not going to run again, maybe now they don't feel the need to line up behind her on the issues,” he added. Unlike the Senate, Mr. Wright's fellow House members have not yet been asked to take a position on any issues in which the Governor has a stake. The Hudak nomination was regarded as Governor Grasso's first big political battle of the legislative session since the State Democratic Party chairman, John Dempsey Jr., had talked to almost every Democratic Senator, counting heads on Mrs. Hudak's behalf. The Governor's two main aides, Chad McCollam and Jay Jackson, also made the rounds. The Senate President Pro Tempore, Joseph Fauliso, Democrat of Hartford, perhaps the legislator who is closest to Mrs. Grasso, buttonholed his colleagues frantically. But despite all this effort, Mrs. Hudak lost, 29‐12, and the homosexual‐rights bill, a measure for which Mrs. Grasso had expressed scant enthusiasm in the past, was approved, 19‐17. The defeat of Mrs. Hudak was the first time ‐memory that a Governor's nomination had been rejected. The homosexual‐rights bill now goes to the House, where its future is doubtful. Many of the Senators were not convinced that Mrs. Grasso's heart was in the fight for Mrs. Hudak. “She wants it,” said one Senator who asked not to be named, “but she doesn't really, really, really want it. There's a difference.” Marcella Fahey, an East Hartford Democrat who ppposed the appointment of Mrs. Hudak, said her talk with the party chairman had taken “about three seconds.” “He asked me, she said, “'Is your position negotiableV That's all he said.” Senator Fauliso, who made two impassioned speeches on Mrs. Hudak's behalf, acknowledged later that the Grasso administration could have lobbied the senators a little more vigorously. “She didn't call them in one by one,” he noted the Governor's tactics. “Maybe she felt she'd be criticized. don't know if I would have done things the same way, but maybe she was right. “The team effort failed,” concluded Mr•. Fauliso. “But I'm not going to get into that.” For most of the Senators, however, the decision‐making process was a persona’ one, in which high‐pressure lobbying played little Part. An attorney, Mr. Sko wronski felt sympathy for Mrs. Hudak, whose Roman Catholic working‐class background was similar to his. He was one of the few nonleaders who talked to Mrs. Grasso about the nomination brief chat at a political reception — and he had told Mr. Dempsey that he would probably vote for Mrs. Hudak. Mr. Skowronski, however, regards himself as an independent thinker. His resume lists memberships in the Polish Falcons and the Sierra Club. “I've always believed in trying to live a full life, experientially,” he said. He took transcripts of a public hearing on Mrs. Hudak's nomination home with him the night before the vote. “She didn't really answer any of the questions,” he explained. “She's a good woman, I'm sure, but I became convinced this isn't the job for her.” An emotional speech by Senator Fauliso on Mrs. Hudak's behalf “put me back on the ropes,” the Senator added. But in the end, Mr. Skowronski concluded that his late‐night decision had been correct. When the Senate had finished with Mrs. Hudak and moved on to homosexual rights, Mr. Skowronski's change of heart was even more abrupt. When he discovered owners of threefamily homes would be banned from discriminating against homosexuals, the Derby Democrat decided to vote against the measure. Had the bill covered only larger houses as he had thought, Mr. Skowronski said, his vote would have been different. Because of the furor caused by the Hudak nomination, the homosexual rights bill has gotten little attention in the legislature this year. Most lawmakers reported having been contacted only by two nr three backers of the bill, and last‐minute mind‐changing was ramps M. Other State Senators appeared to be going through equally free‐wheeling decision‐making. Senator Joseph Ruggierio, a Torrington Democrat, had told his local newspaper that he intended to vote for Mrs. Hudak. But reports that a fellow legislator had bragged about “frightening” the Senator into supporting the nomination changed Mr. Ruggierio's mind. The lobbyists for Mrs. Hudak outside the Governor's office apparently pushed more Senators out of the Hudak camp than Mrs. Grasso's troops pushed in. “I was called a tool of the devil,” Senator Michael J. Skelley, freslunan Democrat from Tolland, complained. Mrs. Fahey said she was called at 8 A.M. one morning and told “this is how Poland fell.” The Governor's ability to persuade the legislature to support her programs may have another test soon. Next week, the Senate will vote on a bill requiring companies to notify the state of pending relocation plans. Mrs. Grasso appears to feel the bill could discourage business development, and already has warned Senate leaders she will veto it if it reaches her desk. The Senate majority leader, Joseph Lieberman, Democrat of Stamford, supporter of the measure, decided not to take up the bill along with homosexual rights and the appointment of Mrs. Hudak this week, much to the dismay of some of its young liberal backers in the Senate. “I jit.st didn't think we had the emotional capacity to hack that one, too,” Mr. Lieberman explained.. ■"
The Region,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/08/archives/the-region-in-summary-carey-gets-his-way-on-budget-with-republican.html,"The New York State Legislature finally passed a $12.6 billion budget last week In a clear victory for Governor Carey. It did not give him everything he wanted, but it apparently left him with little he would have to regret next year. His success was mostly due to the fact that RepUblicans, fearful of tax increases and program cuts as they head toward the election year of 1980, helped him every step of the way. First there was the question of it ??? -- depending en aid funds for abortions for indigent women. It was the Republicans who ftnally gave in after Senate Majority Leader Warren M. Anderson persuaded his colleagues that it was a nowin situation. The Senate then voted, 33‐23, to pass the budget it wanted along with the abortion funding it didn't. The Democratic‐controlled Assembly had paved the way. The Governor also got most of the tighter revenue‐sharing formula he had sought. It is expected to save the state more than $50 million next year by attaching local aid funds to the state's tax base, rather than to the faster‐growing personal income tax, But even some of the tax cuts he asked for, which were rejected piece by piece during the budget negotiations, appeared likely to go through after an announcement by the leaders Friday that they would revive the plan to lower the maximum personal income tax rate, together with other taxreducing programs of their own. Tugboat Strike Has A Double Whammy No holiday or snowstorm prompted suspension of New York City's “alternate-side-of-the-street” parking rules last week. There was Instead a strike by tugboat crews that guide seagoing ships to piers and shepherd 10,000 tons of refuse to landfills every day. The latter task was given over to sanitation trucks, causing curtailment of street‐cleaning activities for which “alternate-side-of-the-street parking” is necessary. The city's bill for the extra sanitation haulage was put at $500,000 a week. But for other reasons, the strike was a blow to New York City. Twenty big freighters arrive and depart each day and the Coast Guard said many delays could be expected and ship agents might divert vessels to other Eastern ports. A spokesman for the United Marine Division, Local 333, International Longshoremen's Association, said the strike was voted unanimously because the 2,800 tugboat, barge and tanker crewmen felt that management's offer of a 6 percent wage increase for each year in a three‐year contract was not enough to keep up with inflation. A Streamlining For Essex County Essex County, whose 900,000 residents make up the largest political subdivision in New Jersey, adopted a new administrative code last week that, according to Peter Shapiro, the County Executive, “represents organization by mission rather than function.” What he meant was a drastic consolidation of 68 boards, bureaus, departments and autonomous agencies under his control. At formal signing ceremonies in Newark, both Mr. Shapiro and members of the Board of Freeholders claimed victory. Although Mr. Shapiro, who is 27 years old, will control eight superdepartments, the Board of Freeholders keeps its power to oversee expenditures by offices not under the County Executive. “I got the reorganization along the lines I pushed for,” Mr. Shapiro said. “The freeholders recognize that these changes were voted for a strong executive and that's what they're going to get — strong centralized government. “ ‘ Gov. Grasso Plays Her China Card Without a formal invitation but with a clear indication of welcome, Gov. Ella T. Grasso of Connecticut is making plans to lead a trade mission to China, due to start in June and include trips to the major industrial cities of Peking, Canton and Shanghai. Mrs. Grasso expects to be accompanied by Edward J. Stockton, her commissioner for economic development, and representatives of at least 10 Connecticut companies mainly engaged in highly specialized manufacturing activities, including optics and laserbeam technology. With commercial delegations lining up outside the Chinese Embassy in Washington for visas to the potential new trade market, the Connecticut delegation apparently used some influence to get to the head of the line. One member of the delegation will be Donald J. Ephlin of West Hartford, an official of the United Auto Workers and a friend and former aide to Leonard E. Woodcock, former head of the U.A.W. and now United States Ambassador to Peking. Mr. Ephlin, according to Connecticut officials, is expected to “help considerably” in eliciting the invitation for the visit, which has already been cleared by the Departments of State and Commerce. There has been no di- rect word from the Chinese but there has been no indication that the invitation will not be extended. ‘Phone‐in Juries’ For Westchester Potential jurors began “phoning in their act” in Westchester last week under a new and economical system likely to be inaugurated soon in New York City. The idea is intended to spare them wasteful waiting time after they are called for duty but before they are impaneled. Under the new system, which produced little confusion in its first week, a person appears on the first day of a normal two weeks of jury duty so eligibilty can be determined. Each eligible juror is then given an identiflcation number and a phone number to call after 5:30 P.M. A recorded message then tells those who phone in and hear their identification numbers when to report. The system has had apparent success throughout the Ninth District counties of Dutchess, Orange, Putnam and Rockland and the state's chief administrative judge, Herbert B. Evans, said: “If it works in the Ninth, we can put it into effect in New York City.” Alvin Davis and Michael Wright"
"Abortion Foes Lose, Vow to Fight Another Day",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/08/archives/abortion-foes-lose-vow-to-fight-another-day.html,"ALBANY — The Right-to-Life movement last week flexed the new muscle displayed in the November election and found it somewhat flabby. The strong showing of abortion foes at the polls last fall, when 130,000 voters cast their ballots on the Right-to-Life Party line, in Albany dissolved to a replay of last spring's unsuccessful battle to stop Medicaid financing for abortions for poor women by amending the state's budget. The Republican‐led Senate, which last year had 32 votes to cut off abortion funds, this year had 33 — in both cases, enough to carry the amendment. But it was blocked in the Democratic‐led Assembly, which last year had 66 votes for the amendment, and this year had 70 — a substantial gain, but still not enough to cut off the funds. After a desultory five‐day delay of the budget, the Legislature adopted the state's $7.5 million local aid appropriation — with the money for Medicaid abortions intact, and with no new restrictions attached. New York, which paid for about 50,000 abortions last year, thus remained one of only eight states that continue to pay for either all or all “medically necessary” abortions for poor people. The battle made it clear that the antiabortion forces still had neither the numerical strength to get their way as majority, nor the political savvy and endurance to enforce their will as a minority. Their leaders’ deep emotions on the issue are not matched by a deep understanding of the intricacies of Albany's maneuvering. In the end, the advocates of keeping the money for abortions in the budget simply sat back and waited for what one described as “heat, heat, pressure, pressure.” The surrender came just before the delay would have interfered with the state's annual foray into the credit markets and its ability to pay local governments. But many legislators on both sides say that the most decisive factor may have been a two‐week break the legislators had scheduled for themselves to begin tomorrow, and that the imperatives of airline scheduling may have been key toward ending the deadlock. Senator James H. Donovan, \viio has 1e against abortion for years, is a Republican from Chadwicks who likens abortion to the Holocaust, the 30 years of war and bloodshed in the Middle East, and the suicide‐massacre the People's Temple cult in Guyana. “The media decried the killing at Jonestown,” Mr. Donovan told his colleagues as they considered the cutoff Medicaid funds early last week. “Isn't it strange we don't hear a similar sentiment when this administration is trying to keep up with the Joneses in their antilife philosophy?” But when asked what his strategy would be to resolve the abortion battle in his favor, Mr. Donovan said simply: don't have a strategy.” The resolution of the debate this year made that clear. Mr. Donovan eventually settled for an agreement from the Assembly leadership to force the amended Senate budget—with the Medicaid funds for abortion removed—to the floor of the Assembly for a vote. Rather than making Mr. Donovan's point, the tactic forced many of his Republican colleagues in the Assembly to make an anguished choice between voting against the budget because its school‐aid provisions hurt their school districts, as many had voted earlier in the week, or voting for it as a symbol of their commitment to the right-to-life movement. In light of the resulting turmoil in the Republican caucus, many Assemblymen speculated that Mr. Donovan would not lead the movement next year. After the rejection of the antiabortion budget in the Assembly, Mr. Donovan was crestfallen. “It serves no useful purpose to pursue the effort at this time,” he told his colleagues in the Senate as they prepared to pass the budget they had scuttled five days before. This first time out, in a nonelection year, having an opronent on the Right-to-Life Party line was apparently not seen as much of a threat by legislators. Of the 14 Assemblymen with the slimmest margins of victory who appeared on a right-to-life “hit list” as the votes to watch, only one switched — and that switch was from an antiabortion position to a proabortion‐funds vote. Two of the newly elected Assemblymen on the list voted the “pro‐life” position, and new Assemblywoman voted in favor of the abortion funds. The Assemblyman at the top of the list, a Democrat who won by a slim 29 votes last November, maintained his earlier position that the funds should be kept. The rest — four whom already supported the right-to-life position — remained the Several advocates of abortion rights also point out that the number of people who voted on the Right-to-Life Party line last November is exceeded by the number of women who had abortions in New York State last year — although no one knows how many of the latter group vote, or on what issues. And no one has gauged a possible backlash by proabortion voters who see on the ballot that the candidate they ve supported for years opposes them on this emotional issue. In a state government in which the Governor, the Speaker of the Assembly, and the Majority Leader of the Senate all favor maintaining Medicaid funding for abortions, antiabortion forces have maintained that holding the budget hostage was the only way to give them enough leverage to get an antiabortion initiative through the Assembly and possibly around a veto from the Governor. But it requires legislators to hold their loyalty to the antiabortion movement above all else — including their regular leaders and the state's fiscal stability — and its likely result has been failure. But this year's defeat appears to have spawned a new tactic. Senator John J. Marchi, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and a passionate antagonist of abortion, announced he would open an investigation into whether all the abortions being paid for by the state were, in fact, “medically necessary.” Mr. Marchi is a skilled veteran Albany political wars. That could eventually result in moves to tighten regulations or enact new restrictions of a milder form that would be harder to defeat in the Legislature, and harder for the Governor to veto.

Tourists Rally Round the Protests,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/08/archives/tourists-rally-round-the-protests-popular-in-summer-and-spring.html,"WASHINGTON, April 7 — Dissatisfied with the activities suggested in the National Park Service's “Dial‐a‐Park” tape recording, a tourist calls the service itself for morq information. “I've seen the Lincoln ‘ Memorial and the Smithsonian,” the tourist says. “Now I'd like to see a demonstration. Can you tell me where one is being held?” once observed only by the police, the hundreds of protests here have become a popular spectator sport for visitors. ‘It's not unusual at all, in fact it's rather routine, to get calls from tourists asking, ‘Where are the demonstrations?’ “ said George Berklacy, a spokesman for the National Park Service. “Some folks come here and they've heard about the demonstrations but they've never actually seen a First Amendment activity,” added Deputy Chief Hugh Groves of the Park Police. “Some of them want to take the kids and have a look.” Popular in Summer and Spring The Park Service issues 700 to 900 permits a year to individuals or groups wanting to stage demonstrations, according to Mr. Berkiacy. In the, spring and summer, he said, there may be as many as six a day. “As soon as somebody sees the sun shining and the trees blooming, the applications start pouring in,” the Park Service spokesman said. “We have so many applying, it's first come, first served. We jest a lot around here that we book the acts and, if the act gets bad reviews, then the Park Police book the actors.” The “actors” range from the thousands of farmers who drove their tractors around downtown Washington earlier this year to call for higher Federal subsidies to the lone man who sat outside the State Department for several months with a handwritten sign asking the United States Government to help his wife emigrate from Hungary. They vary from the familiar legions of abortion opponents who demonstrate annually on the anniversary of the Supreme Court's landmark abortion decision to such little‐known special interest groups as “Hairdressers on Roller Skates” or “Strippers for Christ,” whose few members once passed out pink plastic rosaries in Lafayette Park, across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House. The Park Service rarely denies a request for a permit to demonstrate. The only places where political demonstrations are prohibited are on the grounds of the Supreme Court and within 500 feet of a foreign embassy. Sidewalks across from embassies, however, are a popular location. Although frequent, demonstrations by foreign groups are not popular, according to Park Service and police officials. “A very common reaction is, ‘Why don't you make them go back where they came from?” said Deputy Chief Groves. “A lot of people believe in the First Amendment as far as Americans .are concerned, but they really get bent out of shape when they see foreigners demonstrating here.”"
Other Regional Events,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/08/archives/other-regional-events-feminism-foe-loses-methane-from-garbage.html,"Feminism Foe Loses Eva Hudak, an outspoken opponent of feminist issues including sex education in the schools, the Equal Rights Amendment and abortion, was kept off the Connecticut State Board of Education last week by a 24-to-12 vote the State Senate. Gov. Ella T. Grasso complained that her nominee's defeat would make it difficult to find a replacement. Mrs. Grasso steadfastly backed her nominee by insisting she had a right to be heard. Opponents called Mrs. Hudak “obstructionist” and contended that she lacked background for the job. She dropped out of school at the age of 19 during the Depression and only recently passed a high‐school equivalency test. She also said under committee questioning that she had never heard “The Scarlet Letter” by Hawthorne or “An American Tragedy” by Dreiser. Methane From Garbage A project to extract methane gas for commercial use from a garbage dump near the Meadowlands Sports Complex is under discussion by the New Jersey Public Service Electric and Gas Company and the Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission. Under the plan, the gas would be sold for fuel to a nearby iron works. The commission hopes to encase the garbage dumps in 2,000 acres of parks by the 1990's. Public Service will begin testing a similar smaller project this year at Cinnaminson Township in South Jersey. No‐Fault Refunds Nearly two million New York State motorists will receive $20 million in credits and refunds on their no‐fault automobile insurance over the next six months. The State Insurance Department attributed the refunds to savings realized when the six-year-old no‐fault law was revised to restrict costly damage suits, provide more deductible collision insurance, and require inspection and photographing of vehicles to reduce fraudulent claims. An additional three million passenger‐car policyholders are not eligible now but may be entitled to refunds later, according to the State Insurance Department. Hongisto Embattled The State Corrections Commissioner, Richard D. Hongisto, is by far the most controversial appointment Governor Carey has made. In Albany last week, the Senate Committee on Crime and Corrections opened hearings on Mr. Hongisto's nomination with Republicans asking hostile questions about his past as sheriff of San Francisco and as a coorection official in Cleveland, Ohio, and Democrats asking friendly questions calculated to help him defend himself. One member, Senator Franz S. Leichter of Manhattan, charged that the Republicans were trying to do a “political hatchet job.” But antagonisms built up during Mr. Hongisto's service in California and Ohio, and testimony to come, were seen likely to provide added ammunition for opponents of his nomination. College Merger Eisenhower College in Seneca Falls, N.Y., was hailed by its namesake when it opened in 1968. After the President's death the following year, it received thousands of dollars in contributions in his name. It seemed to be on the way to thriving. Last week, the college announced that it would merge with the Rochester Institute of Technology to become R.I.T.'s 10th campus. Robert Anderson, a former Secretary of the Treasury and now chairman of the college's board of trustees, gave declining enrollments and inflation as reasons for the merger."
Marchi Begins Inquiry Into State Handling Of Abortion Payouts,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/08/archives/marchi-begins-inquiry-into-state-handling-of-abortion-payouts.html,"ALBANY, April 6 — After the defeat of an effort to bar the use of Medicaid funds to finance abortions for poor women, State Senator John J. Marchi, the chairman of the Finance Committee, announced that he would investigate how the state administered the money it spent for abortions. The crux of the issue raised by Mr. Marchi, Republican‐Conservative of Staten Island, was whether the abortions the state paid for were, in fact, “medically necessary.” Only medically necessary abortions are covered by Medicaid under the state law, and abortion foes and some advocates of Medicaid financing — have contended that the interpretation of that language has been quite broad. In addition, Mr. Marchi said he was concerned about examining whether there were “ripoffs” of state funds by the doctors or clinics that performed abortions financed through Medicaid. Mr. Marchi wrote to the state's Commissioner of Social Services, Barbara B. Blum, asking her to provide the Legislature with the names of physicians, hospitals and clinics paid Medicaid funds for abortions during the 1978 fiscal year. He also asked the Commissioner to provide the total amounts paid to physicians for performing abortions, and the number of abortions performed by each hospital and clinic during the same fiscal year. And in a move apparently designed to determine whether the abortions met the “medically necessary” criterion, Mr. Marchi asked for “a résumé of the information required from each physician or institution as to each procedure before any payment is approved.” Commissioner Blum said in a statement that the “information will, of course, be made available to Senator Marchi as quickly as is possible, and I am drafting an affirmative response to his letter.”"
Pennsylvania's Governor Says Area Is Now Safe for Pregnant Women,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/10/archives/pennsylvanias-governor-says-area-is-now-safe-for-pregnant-women-all.html,"HARRISBURG, Pa., April 9 — Harold R. Denton of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission declared today that the crisis at Three Mile Island was over, and Gov. Dick Thornburgh said it was safe for pregnant women and young children to return to their homes. At the crippled reactor, work was still proceeding gingerly toward cold shutdown, even as Mr. Denton announced at a late‐afternoon news conference, “I can consider the crisis over today with regard to the status of the core.” In the five‐mile radius of the plant, radiation emissions were still above normal background levels but were steadily decreasing as Governor Thornburgh rescinded his evacuation recommendation of March 30. “I am lifting all my previous recommendations, advisories and directives,” Governor Thornburgh said. “This means it is now considered safe for pregnant women and preschool children to return to their homes within a five‐mile radius of the Three Mile Island site.” All Schools to Reopen The Governor also declared that all schools not already reopened would do so tomorrow, that state offices would return to normal business and that local civil defense forces would step down from full alert status. Mr. Denton said the highest airborne radiation level recorded by his survey team today was one millirem per hour, measured at cloud level. Readings along the banks of the Susquehanna River, in which Three Mile Island is situated, were no more than two‐hundredths of a milli- rem per hour, compared with normal background levels of one‐hundredth millirem per hour. A millirem measures the absorption of radiation by humans. The average American is exposed to 100 to 200 millirems of radiation per year, including radiation from X‐rays to cosmic rays. A normal chest X‐ray exposes a person to 20 to 30 millirerns. Iodine Levels Dropping Mr. Denton said that the maximum dose of radiation a person living near the plant could have received through the duration of the crisis was less than 100 millirems. That reading, the highest recorded off‐site, was taken at the north gate of the plant and is equivalent to four or five chest X‐rays. Concern that food products, particularly milk, are being contaminated with radioactive iodine 131 also decreased. Mr. Denton said that levels of iodine being released from the plant were dropping steadily, while milk samplings taken by Metropolitan Edison Company, which operates the nuclear plant, showed only trace amounts. Don Beaver, a radiation health physicist in the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources, said that milk samples taken by his department showed little more than one‐tenth the level of iodine that was found in Pennsylvania milk after fallout drifted east from an aboveground Chinese nuclear test in October 1976. He said the present iodine levels were acceptable under Government guidelines. Concern on Pregnanclei As for pregnant women, the Governor's decision brought them home but did not necessarily bring them an end to anxiety. The concern of obstetricians in the area is the 56 hours that elapsed from the time the crisis at Three Mile Island developed until the time the Governor ordered the evacuation, a period during which pregnant women were exposed to unknown amounts of radiation. “I don't know what to tell my patients,” said Dr. Lawrence Silver, who has an office in Middletown, less than five miles from the plant. “If there was danger, then they were told to go too late, after the damage was done,” he said. “If there was no danger, then all of this anxiety was for nothing. I am particularly concerned about pregnant women in the first trimester. Once a baby is formed, it's formed, and any damage done would be genetic, just like to you or me. But the baby takes form in the first 10 to 12 weeks and then they are very susceptible to X‐ray damage. I've known examples of women in their first trimester who had acute abdominal pain, went in for X‐rays and were later advised by their doctors that it was reason enough for an abortion.” ‘Source of Frustration’ Governor Thornburgh, questioned at the news conference on the 56‐hour delay, said he considered the uncertainties of that period “the biggest single source of frustration to me.” He said the delay in recommending evacuation was caused by conflicting information received in the early hours of the crisis. While several obstetricians in the area said they were unconcerned and their patients unemotional about the aftereffects of radiation exposure, several others said they had been beset by women asking about the advisability of abortion. “We are telling these people that we have no firm data about how much radiation was around, particularly in those first two days,” said Dr. Alfred Sherman, whose Sherman Associates is one of the largest practices in the area. “We think there was not much, and we are discour- aging terminating pregnancies.” . . Of the physicians contacted, none said he had done or recommended an abortion. Dr. Silver delivered two healthy baby girls today."
Good News Evangelicals Worry Leaders of the Methodist Church,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/10/archives/good-news-evangelicals-worry-leaders-of-the-methodist-church.html,"WILMORE, Ky. — This bluegrass town, so small that freight trains slash right across Main Street, is also the home of the Good News evangelical movement, which is shaking the United Methodist Church. The Good News emphasis on “orthodox” beliefs and spiritual renewal has become a major political force within the Methodist Church, which has 9.7 million members, and the same evangelical zeal is being expressed by groups within other Protestant denominations. Recently, many evangelical, groups have formed ecumenical alliances. But Good News is something special among these groups. Because of its catchy name and the influence of its bimonthly magazine, it is causing tremors m Methodist centers in New York, Nashville and Dayton. Involvement Is Urged “Evangelicals have always been more inclined to attend prayer worship than work together,” the Rev. Charles W. Keysor, the founder of Good News, said. “Now we are telling evangelicals to use the structure, to get involved, rather than leave the church.” The Good News movement — made up of an undetermined number of conservatives around the United States — is now building a coalition with some of the larger congregations, and church leaders are concerned about a conservative influence at the 1980 General Conference. In the last few months, Good News has been attacked by a Methodist social action group and several bishops. “They claim they are just being religious, but their political and social views are typical of the ‘new right,’ “ said the Rev. George McLain of New York, executive secretary of the unofficial Methodist Federation of Social Action. Setting Is Representative No conservative middle‐American movement could have chosen a more representative setting than Wilmore, a central Kentucky town a few miles south of the wealthy horse farms. It has 2,000 residents, and there are 2,000 students and faculty members at Asbury College and Asbury Theological Seminary. Wilmore is the base for Good News because Mr. Keysor moved here to teach journalism and to connect with the conservative Methodist faction at Asbury. Mr. Keysor, a former public relations man in Illinois, said that he was an agnostic until 1959 when he attended a Billy Graham crusade in Wheaton, Ill., “and took the step forward.” He entered divinity school and was ordained in 1965. Almost immediately, he felt at odds with Methodism. Methodism, founded by John Wesley in England in 1729, has been a powerful and socially active denomination in the United States. Once the largest denomination in this country, it has lost 1.2 million members since 1964 and has yielded first place to the Southern Baptists. “I felt the Methodist Church needed to renew its historical Biblical beliefs,” Mr. Keysor said. He holds that Methodism has been dominated by “humanists” who veered from “Scriptural Christianity.” The central message of Good News, according to Mr. Keysor, is that “Scripture is unequivocal.” “ We do not allow reinterpretation,” he said. “We believe the job of the church is to bear the message of Christ, the redemption of all sinners. We feel the church has been picking up the currents of the culture and putting a Christian message on it.” In his 1966 essay that founded Good News, he listed five major beliefs: the inspiration of Scripture; the virgin birth of Jesus; “that somehow Christ on the cross paid the price of transgression” ; the physical resurrection of Jesus, and the return of Jesus. He feels that many Methodists have strayed from emphasizing those beliefs. He charged that Methodism was lax on homosexuality, allowed “clergy and bureaucrats to run amok with no account‘ ability,” was too lenient in sexual values and supported questionable causes in overseas missions, such as “terrorists in Southern Africa.” He also said that Methodism emphasized “social issues ahead of worship” and was too permissive about abortions. In 1966, Mr. Keysor planned a magazine to express his views but could not think of a name until his wife, Margaret, said, “It will be good news if this magazine ever gets published.” Good News flourished as a magazine, with a circulation of 15,000. It also issues paperbacks and pamphlets, publishes a newsletter for women, offers to conduct revivals and plans to elect conservative delegates to all regional conferences this Year. ‘Menacing Political Force’ “A lot of our critics see us as a menac• mg politics? force — and we are that,” Mr. Keysor said. “But we are also an ad hoc fellowship of Christians. If we felt we had accomlished our task, we would dissolve in a minute. There is nothing permanent about Good News.” In the last generation, Methodism has been a leader in ordaining women (a stand supported by Good News), and its social action departments have supported most aspects of the civil rights, antiwar and antipoverty movements. It has put considerable money and energy into most of the social causes, consider. ing them a Christian mission. In January, the Methodist Foundation for Social Action, which is not supported by the denomination and has often been on the liberal edge of Methodism, charged Good News with “rigid, traditional fundamentalism” that employs “distortions, confrontations, McCarthyism and witch hunts to get its way, and which would align the church with those who ‘rob the poor and crush the afflicted.’ “"

It is three institutions: the Marine Corps, the Supreme Court of the United States and the Roman Catholic Church. And it is written from the points of view of three witnesses: a gunnery sergeant, a Supreme Court Associate Justice and a member of the College of Cardinals. There is actually a fourth witness, a journalist with a tape recorder, who keeps his mouth shut while interviewing the other three; I take him to be Mr. Murphy's tribute to the square of the Gospels, the right angles that try to contain a transcendent truth. “The Vicar of Christ” is Declan Walsh, born an Irish‐American in a family of diplomats, brought up in Mussolini's Italy, to become, in the United States, a student and professor of law and political science. His career is interrupted by World War II, in which he Is a second lieutenant in the Marines, and by “the police action” in Korea, where he is a heroic colonel. His heroism earns him an appointment as President Harry S. Truman's military liaison, after which he is off to the Vatican to agitate for papal indulgence in the Far East peace talks. A Republican President sends him back to the academe in Michigan as a dean. Emphatically Ambitious But Walsh, having written a bestselling book about his experiences in Korea, as well as many articles on jurisprudence for the better sort of scholarly journals, is not only rather wealthy, but also emphatically ambitious. He contemplates, as a Democrat, running for the Senate against a Republican who is old and vulnerable and knows where the various bodies are buried. Walsh is dissuaded by an appointment to the Supreme Court as Chief Justice, in which incarnation he will be an activist on behalf of minority groups and opposed to both capital punishment and abortion. However: His activism takes too much time away from his marriage to Kate, who was his student and drinks too much and who dies. Walsh, remembering the death of a friend in Korea whom he sacrificed for the sake of his battalion, quits the Court to become a Trappist monk. The church will find him in his monastery when it needs a simple Pope. The simple Pope, having been a dean, a marine, and a Justice of the Supreme Court, will not be so simple. He will raise hell with the Curia, as a pacifist and an Ideologue. The machinery here occasionally creaks. Walsh — driven and doomed and the kind of noble noodle that seems to have been abolished by a resolution passed at a committee meeting on whether modern fiction ought to be allowed to fantasize about tragic heroes With Achilles heels, clubbed feet in sweat socks — is dim. He evades his witnesses by disappearing into abso lutes — and an extravagant passion or an angry remorse. He wants to conquer God and establish social justice, as though they were hills in Korea. He dies of hubris, which is unfashionable. Of the witnesses, the least satisfactory is the Associate Justice, who pretends to a fastidiousness of culture with which either he, or Mr. Murphy, is unacquainted. I do not believe him. He need not have been both effete and puerile. His conniving is a cartoon. Perhaps Mr. Murphy is settling an intellectual score, trying to do in a Northeast Brahminism so etiolated as to have become a husk, not a character. Novels require flesh. Even Harvard and Yale have flesh. And Walsh, or Pope Francesco, is more interesting alive than dead. To murder him may satisfy the urges of myth; but it lacks spontaneity. It is theologically willed. In Faces of Frightened Mice Nevertheless: “The Vicar of Christ” is a novel about institutions, and it understands institutions at a time when most of us think of them as places to which other people are committed. It is about greed and desire and ambition, when most of us are frightened mice. It dares tragedy, when most of umuddle and rationalize and can't sleep at night because we think we are creeps. It may not be a graceful book—the book is Irving Wallace into the communion wafers and of the chalice of sacramental wine — but it delivers the goods; it informs; it makes us think. It also divides itself up into sections by the poems of Cbigniew Herbert, a Pole whose splendid portrait is so far unavailable in this country. If, to keep in touch, you require yourself to read at least one best‐selling novel a year, “The Vicar of Christ” is the one. It has the grace to click."
Cancer From the Radiation,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/12/archives/cancer-from-the-radiation.html,"It appears that the risk of a major catastrophe at the Three Mile Island nuclear facility has been narrowly avoided. The public should understand the long‐term human consequences of the accident so that it may be in a position to consider intelligently the many complex issues it raises. The conclusions it reaches will involve medical, economic and social factors. I address my remarks only to the first. To my knowledge, no individual suffered an exposure to the radiation that Is likely to cause any substantial shortterm radiation sickness. Several workers may have received nearly onetenth of this dose. But exposure to very low levels of radiation is known to cause cancer. birth defects and spontaneous abortions. There is often a long latent period —10 to 30 years — before cancers develop. There may be no obvious causal relationship: The cancers will be randomly dispersed throughout the one million people who were exposed. But cancers will develop from this accident — this is not in dispute. We can arrive at a very rough estimate of the number of cancers that this accident will cause, making a few of several possible assumptions. (Some of these assumptions, if wrong, would tend to decrease my estimate of the incidence of cancer; others, to increase it.) The initial exposure rates, the news media reported, were about 15‐30 milliroentgens per hour five to 10 miles downwind. (To compare this to the 20milliroentgens dose of a single dental X‐ray is misleading because only a small portion of the Jaw is exposed for less than a second. In Pennsylvania, the entire human body was exposed to this dose hour after hour.) Assume that this exposure rate lasted 12 hours: The dose absorbed by the body would be about 230 millirads. (The milliroentgen is a unit of transmitted radiation, the millirad is a unit of absorbed radiation.) Assume further that during the three or four days after the initial release of radioactive steam, when reports indicated that dose rates were decreasing rapidly, an additional 250 millirads were absorbed. Total dose: 500 millirads. All of us receive, on the average, about 100 millirads per year (about 0.3 millirads per day) from cosmic rays. from the small amounts of radium‐like elements in brick, from the radioactive elements in food. This Is the normal background rate. So for the initial one‐day interval, the radiation downwind from the nuclear station was more than 1,000 times the background rate. Those who were exposed absorbed five years of background radiation in a day or two. With these estimates of radiation exposure we can estimate how many deaths can be expected to result eventually from the accident. In 1972, the National Academy of Sciences published a report entitled “The Effects on Population of Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation” that concluded that 1,000 millirads (assumed equal to 1,000 milliroentgens) will result in just over 100 cancer deaths per million people during the 25 years following exposure. Thus, an additional 50 cancer deaths for the Pennsylvania population exposed to about 500 millirads can be expected. This estimate involves many assumptions. The one most often questioned is that of a linear‐dose response. It holds that no threshold exists below which cellular mechanisms can totally repair the radiation‐induced lesions and prevent the initiation of the chain of events that lead to a malignancy. I would argue that we live in a sea of man‐made and natural carcinogens: A large fraction of cancers are environmentally induced. Consequently, we are already considerably above this postulated (probably fictitious) threshold. Any small increment in the environmental carcinogenic burden will cause a small but finite increment In cancer prevalence. These cancers will appear to be random, spontaneous, and without cause. Twenty years from now, we might well wonder whether the deaths came from industrial pollution, smoking, saccharin, or were just the result of an act of God. Had a “mad” bomber killed these 59, we would be shocked. Twenty‐five years from now, these deaths will go completely unnoticed. Still, these are real men, women and children. And the deaths will be real."

5% Cap Law Tests `Landmark’ Judge,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/15/archives/new-jersey-weekly-5-cap-law-tests-landmark-judge.html,"ATLANTIC CITY WELL aware that every municipality in New Jersey is looking over its shoulder, the State Supreme Court is considering an appeal of a decision by Judge Philip A. Grucdo of Superior Court that permitted Atlantic City to bypass the 5 percent “cap” law and hand out state‐arbitrated salary increases. If the court overturns Judge Grucdo's ruling — and precipitates the layoff of hundreds of city workers here it would be the first reversal of any of the “landmark decisions” attributed to Judge Gruccio in the last four years. Judge Gruccio's parish priest once denounced him from the pulpit for riling that a married Woman was entitled to an abortion without the consent of her husband. But the judge, who describes himself as a “devote, conservative Roman Catholic,” said he was not disturbed because “I knew what I was doing.” Accustomed to controversy, outspoken and exceptionally popular among trial lawyers, Judge Gruccio, himself the father of five children, stArecl up the church when he ruled earlier that two Cumberland County hospitals (in Vineland and Bridgeton) were required by law to perform elective abortions. “How could you, with your background, do this to the church?” a priest asked Judge Gruccio after that decision. The judge, who completed four years of theological study while also studying law at Georgetown, replied: “I am trained to be the judge for all people, and I feel no challenge to my own religious convictions.” Those convictions are so deep that Judge Gruccio often travels miles to attend a church offering the old Latin liturgical mass, which has been long gone from most Catholic churches. The word “landmark” continues to characterize the judge's calendar. For example, he upheld the right of a New Jersey Bell Telephone Company employee to be provided with safe working conditions by restricting smoking in nonwork areas. Specifically, he ordered that the utility forbid smoking in the Millville office of Donna M. Skimp, a service representative. Judge Gruccio said that it had been established that she was allergic to cigarette smoke generated by three of the six workers with whom she shared the office. The ruling was a shot in the arm for antismoking organizations. Later, Judge Gruccio handed down controversial guidelines requiring adoption agencies to search for natural parents if requested to do so by adopted children, and prove that disclosing the parental identity would not be harmful to the parents or the child. Those guidelines have led to dozens of parent‐children reunions. The judge believes that the Supreme Court will uphold him on Atlantic City's right to pay wage increases beyond the 5 percent cap because they had been mandated by a state arbitrator. The court reserved decision after hearing two hours of testimony in the appeal, which was brought by the state. The New Jersey League of Municipalities joined the suit as a friend of the court, arguing that exempting the salary awards would ruin the intent of the caps law, which is aimed at reducing property taxes and rotting back on government expenditures. Judge Gruccio has been on the bench since his appointment by former Gov. William T. Cahill in 1972. Previously, he had had a 20‐year career as a trial lawyer. Be was born and reared in Vineland."
POPE MAKES APPEAL FOR WORLD'S POOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/16/archives/pope-makes-appeal-for-worlds-poor-the-plight-of-destitute-children.html,"ROME, April 15 — Pope John Paul II, in an Easter message today, appealed for peace and human rights, and strongly reminded a great throng at St. Peter's of the plight of poor people and especially the sufferings of destitute children. The Pope addressed a greeting of peace to the “peoples of the Middle East,” and to those in all other parts of the world “who live in the various social, economic and political systems.” The head of the Roman Catholic Church, who will complete the first six months of his pontificate tomorrow, spoke from the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica before imparting his traditional blessing “urbi et orbi” — “to the city of Rome and to the world.” A crowd of at least 100,000 people filled the vast St. Peter's Square and all approaches to it, and repeatedly broke into applause while the Pope was speaking. After the benediction there were long cheers. Plight of Poor Stressed Speaking in faintly accented Italian, the first Polish Pope in history called for peace “as the fruit of fundamental order; as the expression of respect for every human being's right to truth, freedom, justice and love.” He forcefully reminded his listeners —the throng below and the international radio and television audience — of the plight of the poor everywhere. “Peace of consciences and peace of hearts!” the Pope said. “This peace cannot be had unless each one of us has the awareness of doing everything in his or her power so that a life worthy of the children of God will be insured for all men and women.” He added: “I am thinking at this moment in particular of all those who are suffering for the lack of what is strictly necessary for existence, and above all of the little children, who, in their weakness, are the ones who are specially loved by Christ and to whom is dedicated this year, the International Year of the Child.” This passage was particularly applauded by a group of several hundred Italians who at the urging of a Committee for Life, Peace and Disarmament had marched three miles across the center of Rome to St. Peter's Square. The committee includes Communists and advocates of separation between church and state. The Easter march to St. Peter's Square was the idea of Marco Panella, one of the founders of the tiny Radical Party and gadfly of Italian politics who in the past has irked the Vatican by his advocacy of divorce and abortion. Mr. PaneIla is crusading for stepped‐up international aid for hungry children. When the marchers crossed the Tiber River to reach St. Peter's Square, the police ordered them to put away their flags and signs. There were a few scuffles, but order was quickly restored. No other incidents occurred. Before the Pope addressed and blessed the crowd, he celebrated outdoor mass at an altar erected in front of the portico of St. Peter's. When he appeared on the balcony at noon, scores of people in the piazza below released toy balloons that slowly floated into the sunny sky. The Pope appeared to enjoy the country‐fair spectacle. In his address he extolled the Resurrection of Jesus as “the revelation of the power of God.” Jerusalem Heralds the Day JERUSALEM, April 15 (AP) —chorus of church bells and a litany of prayer in a dozen languages heralded Easter Sunday celebrations at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in the old walled city of Jerusalem. A jostling crowd of about 1,000 Roman Catholic faithful received communion and heard the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem celebrate the Mass of the Resurrection at the church's towering marblewalled mausoleum, revered as the tomb of Jesus. A choir of Franciscan priests in white robes trimmed in gold led the worshipers in Latin hymns as the patriarch, Msgr. Giacomo Guiseppe Beltritti, said the mass."
Quixotic Italian Politician Enlists Pope in His Cause,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/18/archives/quixotic-italian-politician-enlists-pope-in-his-cause-help-for.html,"ROME, April 17 — The Italians have long bestowed recognition on him as the country's No. 1 gadfly.cause of the inefficiency of the Government apparatus, may go a long way toward making up for the scarcity of funds and organization. Now even the familiar and largely unloved characters of what is known here as the “waxworks” — the Italian Establishment with its politicians, always the same, who have monopolized power for 30 years — seem to sense that he has become a dangerous rival and may in the end build a serious national force. He is Marco Pannella, the leader of the small Radical Party. The 48‐yearold civil libertarian from the Abruzzi Mountains is still little known abroad, although masterly use of the media has made him one of the best‐known public figures in Italy. Help for Starving Children For years he has been champion of conscientious objectors, feminists, homosexuals, prison inmates, opponents of nuclear energy and other nonconformists. He has had a leading part in introducing divorce legislation, has crusaded for legalized abortion, is sponsoring a referendum to outlaw hunting in a country where millions of guns are aimed at small migratory birds every weekend, and is right now engaged in a drive to raise funds for starving children throughout the world. Beards and blue jeans have dominated his rallies. But now, the “silent majority” of middle‐aged people who wear neckties or skirts are taking notice of him. Mr. PanneIla has taken on the Vatican, the church‐backed Christian Democratic Party and the Communist apparatus, in other words, all the pillars of the Italian system. He has been arrested at least 70 times for civil disobedience. As the “Gandhi from the Abruzzi,” he seems forever fasting to dramatize some grievance, when he will live for weeks on cappuccino and vitamin pills, and shed 20 pounds in the process. More Time on the Air He has led innumerable sit‐ins, and a few days ago emerged again victorious from a one‐man raid on the headquarters of Italy's state television system after extracting a promise from officials that he and his group would get more time on the air. This is of maximum importance to the Radical Party because, while it lacks any vote‐getting machine, it has the invaluable asset of Mr. Pannella's witty showmanship. At Easter, he pulled off another pub. lic relations coup. Skinny from a justfinished fast to attract attention to the plight of hungry children, Mr. Pannella managed to muscle into the big Roman spectacular of the Pope's benediction “urbi et orbi (“to the city and to the world”) and share television exposure with John Paul II. It went like this. At the beginning of Holy Week, Mr. PanneIla announced he would organize a peaceful march across the center of Rome on Easter Sunday, leading nonbelievers and agnostics from somewhere in the city's northeast for three miles to St. Peter's Square where they would reverently listen to the Pope deliverng his Easter message in the hope that. the head of the Roman Catholic Church would speak a word on behalf of destitute children everywhere. A nonpartisan committee, including Communists, Socialists and representatives of small left‐of‐center groups, was quickly formed to sponsor Mr. Pannella's Easter parade. Praise From a Theologian To his delight, and to general surprise, the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano in a Good Friday editonal by its house theologian, the Rev. Gino Concetti, accorded cautious praise to the Radical leader's idea. On Sunday, Mr. Pannella, the other members of his committee and several hundred sympathizers, some wearing jogging shoes, walked to St. Peter's Square to join at least 100,000 people who had gathered to receive the Pope's blessing. Pope John Paul, in his address from the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica before the benediction, did mention “the little children who, in their weakness, are the ones who are specially loved by Christ,” and needed every care humanity could give them. The Pope, did not go solar as to mention Mr. Pannella and his followers down at the fringe of the vast piazza. But even so, Italian television gave the Radical leader ample time in its Easter news programs. Most newspapers reported on Mr. Pannella and the Pope under one headline. This was the same Radical leader who five years ago led the fight against the Vatican and the Christian Democratic Party when they were crusading for repeal of Italy's divorce law. The nation, in a referendum, backed divorce by a three‐to‐two vote. 4 Seats for the Radicals In the last national elections, in 1976, the Radical Party won nearly 400,000 votes and sent Mr. Pannella and three other leaders, including two women, into the 630‐seat Chamber of Deputies. Now, as the campaign for another election, on June 3, is getting under way, Mr. Pannella is boldly predicting that this time there will be millions of votes for the Radicals. The campaign strategists of the big political parties concede uneasily, though privately, that Mr. Pannella's movement may indeed have gained ground lately because of what they describe as his skillful manipulation of the media. “With 50 Radical deputies in Parliament, the thieves would be put in jail, and the murderers would be tracked down and punished,” Mr. Pannella said the other day. Such a campaign slogan, in a country that is disgusted by corruption, frightened at terrorism and disillusioned be. Campaign Funds Are Shunned Mr. Pannella's Radicals are spurning the campaign contributions that, under a law enacted some years ago, all parties represented in Parliament may request from the rational treasury. As in the last elections, the Radical campaign symbol is a fist clutching a red rose. And again, Mr. PanneIla is carrying the Radical Party's message up and down the Italian peninsula and into Sicily and Sardinia: Away with the “old faces” in politics, the waxworks! Away with the inert bureaucracy, the costly military establishment, the meddling of the church in state affairs! An apostle of nonviolence, Mr. Pannella has been preaching for years that the social reforms Italy needa may be brought about within the framework of the Constitution and the many laws that have never been carried out, a position that reflects Mr. Pannella's legal training. The son of a small landowner in the Abruzzi and a French Swiss mother, he won a law degree at Rome University and worked briefly as a lawyer before becoming a journalist and co‐founder of the Ralical movement. Wartime Partisans Scolded The Radical Party also strongly condemns the terrorism of the Red Brigades. So does the Communist Party, but Mr. PanneIla recently enraged its leadership by publicly drawing a parallel between the murderous violence of ultraleftist guerrillas and a bombing that Communist Partisans had carried out in Nazi‐occupied Rome during World War II. In that attack, 32 German soldiers died, and the Nazis, in reprisal, shot 335 Italian hostages in the Ardeatine Caves on the city's outskirts. Mr. Panne recalled that the Communist underground fighters who had planted the bomb did not step forward and allowed innocent people to be slain in the reprisals. Communist spokesmen branded Mr. Pannella's remarks about the wartime episode as “fascist.” However, his comments may have won him the sympathy, and maybe even some votes, of moderate and right‐wing Italians who have been saying privately all along what he said in public. Mr. PanneIla's recent exploits have strengthened his reputation as his country's leading maverick who will always say and do the unexpected, a quixotic figure, forever eager to ride into the fray and pick any fight for human rights."
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/18/archives/letters-riskbenefit-ratios-and-the-value-of-a-life.html,"To the Editor: In his March 26 letter, Senator Richard Schweiker of Pennsylvania states that there is a need for striking a balance between the risks and benefits in the use of food additives and that existing Federal regulation is inadequate. There can be little disagreement with this view. He also says that his recently introduced food additive safety amendments would consider whether the benefits outweigh the risks, and if so the additive would not be banned. This statement is overly simplistic and hence misleading. It is generally recognized today that even when reasonably “hard” data exist for both risks and benefits, judgment is required in the implementation of regulations. It happens more frequently that risks and benefits are hardly quantifiable at all. No doubt, Senator Schweiker's proposed legislation is based on a recent report issued jointly by the Institute of Medicine and the National Academy of Sciences. There are at least two fundamental aspects of this report that are disturbing and should be brought to public attention. The first concerns the statement in the report that new analytical methods are so sensitive that they can detect very low levels of carcinogens. The clear implication is that the amounts detectable are so low that they may not be hazardous when eaten, and therefore need not be banned. The scientific logic of this escapes me, for there is a continuing discussion in scientific circles concerning low‐level effects, and the indications are that even the smallest amount of any given carcinogen may sometimes play a role in producing cancer. Moreover, very little is known about the cumulative effects of a number of different carcinogens, each ingested repeatedly at very low doses. Enhancement of the effects of a carcinogen by other substances is known to occur in man and is probably not uncommon. The enhancement by alcohol of the cancerous effects of cigarette smoking is an example. In this connection, I am also concerned that the new I.O.M.‐N.A.S. report recommendations might permit the use of packaging materials which leach carcinogens into the packaged food, on the basis that the amounts leached are presumably low. Again, what is the meaning of low? The second disturbing point in the report concerns a new element among the presumed benefits. For the first time in food additive regulation the I.O.M.‐N.A.S. would deem it permissible to consider the economic benefit “to food suppliers and others.” Here the implicit assumption is that the profit of. the manufacturer can be balanced off against the health of the consumer. The relationship is difficult for me to see, and here I agree with the F.D.A. Commissioner, Donald Kennedy, M.D., when he says, “I do not want the power to weigh economic benefits against health risks unless Congress explicitly tells me the value of a life.” In considering the continued high rate of cigarette smoking and the controversy over the use of saccharin, it is apparent that the habits of the public are not easily reversed or eliminated. The I.O.M.‐N.A.S. recommendations convey a distressing and unpalatable overtone in this regard. The report seems to take the view that as long as people have been warned about risks, it is up to them to use judgment. This sort of view is irresponsible because relentless mass advertising is much more effective than mild admonitions such as appear on cigarette packages. The public is hence conditioned in these matters, usually for the worse, and it rarely has any basis for independent judgment. The fact is that under the present circumstances it cannot fully appreciate the risks either of food additives or of environmental pollutants. The public has become the unwitting victim of economic forces that irrelevant to health. A Query for Carter To the Editor: Although I generally support President Carter's new energy policy, I am puzzled by some of his rhetoric. For example: Suppose John and Mary are digging in their backyard and discover oil. At the time they discover it, the Government had a law prohibiting them from selling their oil for whatever a willing buyer would pay. Later, however, this law is repealed, and they sell their oil at the market price. Jimmy and Billy, on the other hand. grow peanuts in their backyard. Unfortunately, no one is willing to pay as much for the peanuts as Jimmy and Billy would like. Therefore the Government forces their neighbors to make up the difference between what the buyers are willing to pay for the peanuts and the price Jimmy and Billy would Like to charge. My question to President Carter is In which of these cases is someone receiving “unearned” profits? Debtors’ Remedy To the Editor: Having so well identified the factors creating “A New Breed of Debtors” in his Op‐Ed article in the April 5 issue, Paul Gross then neglects to include debt adjustment under Chaper XIII of the United States Bankruptcy Code as an inexpensive and effective remedy to those problems. This remedial law, which avoids liquidation of assets, deserves to be better known in the metropolitan area. Vulnerable OPEC To the Editor: It might be useful for the Carter Administration to notice that the OPEC countries, being importers of food, fiber and machinery, are vulnerable to interesting counterpressures from the industrial world. Oil Lobby Lesson To the Editor: Once again an overburdened American public is being asked to absorb the shock of oil price increases resulting from deregulation. Had this deregulation been directly linked to a windfall profits tax, we might have been somewhat comforted. However, we now hear from analysts and government watchers that there is little likelihood a windfall profits tax will be imposed by Congress because of the pressure of the all‐powerful oil lobby. Their victory is assured if they are permitted to override the ultimate silent lobby — the constituency of each elected official. If we continue to vent our anger on the hapless gas station attendant and weary checkout clerk rather than on our elected officials, we are playing into the hands of the lobbies who thrive on our negligence. We have not yet: learned their simple lesson: Let your views be known and apply the pressure. What greater incentive for an elected official than the promise of re. election for representing your interests? Meanwhile, the oil companies are banking on your silence. ‘Reality’ of Halting Public Funding of Abortions To the Editor: The March 27 full‐page advertisement in The New York Times by Planned Parenthood favoring state funding of abortions served neither the national debate on abortion nor Planned Parenthood well. It talked about grave maternal health consequences if state abortion funds are restricted and (a) cited a Center for Disease Control official saying, “We know that some women are resorting to nonphysicians or self‐induced abortions”; (b) cited a case history of one woman Injured by a nonprofessional abortion; (c) cited the Alan Guttmacher Institute stating that “we can expect more poor pregnant women will resort to these dangerous alternatives,” and (d) cited Senator Kennedy speaking of “... hundreds of deaths each year.” Before the restrictions placed on Federal abortion funding on Aug. 4, 1977, physicians at the Center for Disease Control maintained that “as a result of the fund cutoff, between 44 and 90 women would die within the year from botched abortions.” Some estimates went higher. Senator Kennedy in letters to constituents referred to hundreds of deaths each year. Well, the Government has reduced its abortion funding by 99 percent and we can now examine the experience of more than a year and a half. In Febru ary 1978 The Washington Post reported:” ... preliminary data [of the Center for Disease Control] show that the ‘bloodbath’ many predicted simply is not happening. ‘We're delighted we haven't seen it,’ said Dr. Willard Cates Jr., head of the center's abortion surveillance branch and one of those to make the death projections.” In its Feb. 2, 1979, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the Center said: “In August 1977 Federal funds for abortion for Medicaid‐eligible women were restricted. To measure the impact of this restriction on abortion‐related complications, C.D.C. initiated a hospital surveillance project in 13 states and the District of Columbia. No increase in abortion‐related complications was observed in this surveillance project.” In the one case where C.D.C. officials attribute an abortion‐related death directly to the fund cutoff, it has been challenged by articles in both The Washington Post and Ob/Gyn News. This is the reality of the maternalhealth implications of stopping the public funding of abortions, and it is irresponsible for Planned Parenthood to imply otherwise. An ‘Extraordinary Exercise’ of Waiver to Benefit the P.L.O. To the Editor: It is shocking that Shafik al‐Hout, director of the P.L.O. in Beirut, is currently touting the United States because the Attorney General, following the special intercession of the Secretary of State, has waived the provisions of Section 28 (f) of our immigration laws — provisions that were expressly designed to deny people like Hout the privilege of coming into our country. The waiver is doubly deplorable in the light of assurances repeatedly given last summer by the Department of State that the so‐called McGovern Amendment and other provisions of the immigration laws will not deco. gate from the departmental judgment that “as a matter of policy we consider any official of the P.L.O., and its designated or self‐proclaimed agents or spokesmen, ineligible for visas.” The current extraordinary exercise of waiver is explained by State Department officials on the claim that Mr. Hout belongs to a sector of the P.L.O. that allegedly declines to espouse terror as a means of political change. What permits the department to ascribe benign intentions to flout is beyond us. These assertions are made in the very teeth of the clear, open and unabashed purpose expressed in the Palestine National Covenant to bring about the violent overthrow and dissolution of Israel. Mr. flout is the head of the P.L.O. office in Beirut. Neither he nor any other official of the P.L.O. ever disavowed this intention or in an. way separated himself from this or the other bloody ambitions embodied it the P.L.O. charter. Just a few days ago the head of Mr Hout's organization promised to “cut off the hands” of President Carter. Mt. Begin and Mr. Sadat and pledged a wave of terror against United States installations all over the world. One wonders by what political alchemy the state Department now renders Hootvisit in this country consonant with the national interest of the United States. For some time there has been concern that elements within our own Government are not as firm and as clear in their opposition to the intercession of the P.L.O. in Middle Eastern affairs as might have been expected from statements made by the President and Vice President and other ranking officials. This astonishing exercise of waiver can only contribute to that concern. The Israeli‐Egyptian peace treaty contemplates our Government assuming a continuing role in monitoring and carrying out the terms of that agreement. This role depends upon all parties retaining confidence and a sense of security in the objectivity and impartiality of the United States: The action by the Secretary of State can only confuse and undermine that requisite sense of confidence. It cannot help but gratuitously burden the peace process and endanger the successful workingout of relations between parties. This clumsy act could not have come at a worse time. It is inexcusable both as a matter of law and as a matter of politics. It is inexcusable, period."
Debate on Exposés Held Up a Pulitzer,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/18/archives/debate-on-exposes-held-up-a-pulitzer.html,"A lively discussion on how newspapers should gather news and exposés marked this year's award of Pulitzer Prizes for journalism, and was reported yesterday to have helped block a prize for local investigative reporting for The Chicago Sun‐Times. A wide range of interviews showed that The Sun‐Times had been one of four choices submitted by a nominating jury to the Pulitzer Prize Board. The chairman of the jury, Joseph W. Shoquist, managing editor of The Milwaukee Journal, said it stayed within the rules by serving as an advisory body, listing the choices alphabetically and not specifying a preference. At the board level, it was learned, Clayton Kirkpatrick, editor and vice president of The Chicago Tribune, moved to give the prize to his competitor Chicago daily.. The issue was over The Sun‐Times's buying and running a bar under a false name, as a result of which it uncovered corruption and bribe‐taking among city inspectors and private accountants. Benjamin C Bradlee, executive editor of The Washington Post, and Eugene C. Patterson, editor and president of The St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times, contended that newspapers should operate in the open. “We instruct our reporters not to misrepresent themselves, period,” Mr. Bradlee commented yesterday. The majority of the board then voted to give the prize to Gilbert M. Gaul and Elliot G. Jaspin of The Pottsville (Pa.) Republican who had reported on destruction of an anthracite‐coal company by a group linked to organized crime. The four candidacies reported by the jury included The Philadelphia Daily News, for stories on drug abuse by physicians, and The Philadelphia Inquirer, for stories on the Pennsylvania legislature. In a similar pattern of undercover reporting, The Sun‐Times had also put people to work in legal, abortion clinics, resulting in exposures that closed three clinics and suspended another. Its “abortion profiteers” series made it runner‐up for the annual Pulitzer Prize gold medal for public service. The jury in that category was headed Norman E. Isaacs, chairman of the National News Council. Mr. Isaacs said yesterday that the jury by a 3‐to‐2 vote recommended The Point Reyes (Calif.) Light, for reporting abuses in the Synanon drug program, with two votes going to The Sun‐Times. The board approved the California weekly's choice. A canvass showed that various juries had expressed preferences for prize‐winners other than those finally recommended by the 14‐member board and an- nounced by Dr. William J. McGill, Columbia University president. Jury preferences included the following: Commentary — Vermont Royster, of The Wall Street Journal, instead of Russell Baker, of The New York Times. The jury chairman, Gerald L. Warren, editor of The San Diego (Calif.) Union, said Mr. Baker “was on our list and his entry was excellent and highly thought of.” National Reporting — The Chicago Tribune, for a series on the impact of world trade on individuals, communities. and companies in the United States instead of James Risser of The Des Moines Register. The jury chairman, Robert H. Phelps, executive editor of The Boston Globe, said Mr. Risser was among five candidates listed for the board. Editorial Writing — Philip Goldsmith, of The Philadelphia Inquirer, for editorial writing, instead of Edwin M. Yoder Jr., of The Washington Star, who wasalso listed by the jurors. Editorial Cartooning — Robert Wayne Englehart Jr., of The Dayton (0.) Journal Herald, instead of Herbert L. Block,of The Washington Post. Mr. Englehart's name had been the jury's only submission. History — Anthony F. C. Wallace, University of Pennsylvania professor of anthropology, for “Rockdale: The Growth of An American Village in the Early Industrial Revolution,” instead of “The Dred Scott Case,” by Don E. Febrenbacher. Poetry — Mark Strand, for “The Late Hour,” favored by two of the three poetry jurors, instead of Robert Penn Warren, for “Now and Then,” which was favored by the chairman, Louis Simpson, professor of English at State University of New York at Stony Brook."
An Ayatollah Who Must Be Reckoned With,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/19/archives/an-ayatollah-who-must-be-reckoned-with-mahmoud-taleghani-man-in-the.html,"TEHERAN, Iran, April 18 — Last October, when the Teheran newspaper Keyhan published a list of the six most prominent ayatollahs in Iran, the name of the 72‐year‐old religious leader of Teheran. Ayatollah Mahmoud Taleghani, was not among them. But in a country where religious status is heavily influenced by political clout, the name of Ayatollah Taleghani is now second on that list — right after that of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Many people around here would rather see it at the top. In the space of six months the shrewd, white‐bearded and wiry Ayatollah Taleghani has become something of a folk hero in Iran. Many tales are told about the way he withstood torture during 12 years in the Shah's prisons, while “others” — meaning Ayatollah Khomeini — lived safely in exile. His house in Teheran has become the Mecca of Iranians who feel the Government of Ayatollah Khomeini has done them wrong. Before Ayatollah Taleghani closed his offices and his house in the capital and left for an unknown destination to protest what he called a return of “dictatorship and despotism,” a large delegation of unemployed workers went to his house. They said they would rather talk with him about their problems than with the Minister of Labor. A few weeks ago, when Kurdish separatists were fighting battles with the Iranian Army and Islamic militia forces, only one person was acceptable as a mediator — Ayatollah Taleghani. Later, when fighting broke out with Turkomans, it was again he who went to mediate the dispute. Ayatollah Taleghani has gained the title “fixer” in Iran's new order. For three days now, his absence from the capital has sparked large demonstrations. Photographs of Ayatollah Taleghani rival in number those of Ayatollah Khomeini. It was perhaps with full knowledge of his influence with the Iranian people that Ayatollah Taleghani decided to flex his muscles the other day, after the arrest of two of his sons and a daughter‐in‐law by Islamic militia units of Ayatollah Khomeini's komitehs, or revolutionary committees. Ayatollah Khomeini said in a statement yesterday that the arrests had not been motivated by any personal grudge. It was noted, however, that Ayatollah Taleghani refused to agree to an exchange of the head of the komiteh in Teheran, arrested by his own men, for his sons. In a statement that has won widespread acclaim, Ayatollah Taleghani said he wanted to “defend the independence and freedom of the people of Iran and not to give a chance to dictatorship and despotism to return.” Ultimately his sons were released. But he said he refused to return until he has had an opportunity to talk with Ayatollah Khomeini in Qum. Tonight, it was reported that hundreds of people were driving to Qum because of his presence there. While everyone in the Government has been quick to deny any break between the two ayatollahs, the religious pillars of Iran, a break has been in the making for some time. There is a fundamental difference in the personalities of the two men. Ayatollah Kohmeini has shown himself a person of little flexibility, greatly motivated by desire for revenge against those who have slighted him, and politically intolerant of views contrary to his vision of a theocratic Islamic state. Ayatollah Taleghani, tempered by years of imprisonment and political opposition to the Shah at the risk of his life, is the opposite. He has opened his doors to all political factions, including Marxist Fedayeen and Islamic Mujahedeen guerrillas, many of whom he met in jail. One of his five sons, Sayed‐Mojtaba, is a member of the People's Mujahedeen, an Islamic socialist guerrilla group, who two years ago joined in founding a more radical branch of the group known as Sazman Beykar, or the Fighting Organization. Another son is said to be a member of the Marxist Fedayeen Khalq guerrillas. Ayatollah Taleghani's tolerance is evident in the fact that many of his children, including his daughters, are active in social or political organizations. A few days ago, Azamolsadat, one of his five daughters resigned from the Women's Organization in protest over the arrest of her brothers. The Ayatollah's attitude has caused some to refer to him as the Red Mullah. People who know him well say nothing is further from the truth. They say that Ayatollah Taleghani is devout and note that as recently as a month ago he declared total support for the Islamic republic proposed by Ayatollah Khomeini. He has advocated that Islamic laws be imposed under all circumstances. In a recent interview, the Ayatollah said that even if a democratically elected parliament voted in favor of something like abortion “it will be overruled by Islamic tenets.” Unlike the majority of religious leaders here who advocate an Islamic republic, Ayatollah Taleghani insists that “government must not be forcefully imposed on people as it has been in the past.” He has championed the right of religious as well as political minorities, including the Communist Tudeh Party, to practice their beliefs freely. He has supported trials of political leaders of the Shah's regime but warned against “innocent people being hurt by the impulse to take revenge.” The Ayatollah has refused to participate in the Islamic courts that are trying members of the Shah's regime and usually handing down death sentences against them. He is also said to have turned down membership in the secretive ruling Revolutionary Council. “He is the only existing religious leader acceptable to all different political factions in Iran because he respects everybody,” said a human rights lawyer. “I guess it boils down to the fact that people believe that he means what he says.” Ayatollah Taleghani's career has helped him greatly in winning people's confidence. He studied Islam in religious schools of the holy city of Qum and obtained the highest degree in Islamic scholarship, the title of Ayatollah, or Reflection of God. Ayatollah Taleghani quickly established his political credentials in 1961 by joining the Nehzate Azadi, or Freedom Movement, headed by Mehdi Bazargan, now Prime Minister. They have been friends ever since. Ayatollah Taleghani was the first Iranian religious leader to denounce the monarchy of Shah Riza Mohammed Pahlevi as “illegal” and the first to go to jail for it. He spent 12 years in jail in various stretches, the last from 1974 until his release in November, 1978. Barely a month after his release Ayatollah Taleghani called for a huge march of protest and led the marchers in the name of Ayatollah Khomeini. He never exploited his imprisonment for political ends, and he refuses to answer when asked whether he was tortured. Ayatollah Taleghani was born in the town of Taleghan. He has traveled to Mecca for the Moslem pilgrimage and has visited Shiite shrines in Iraq. Litte is known about the Ayatollah's personal life. It is not known, for example, whether he lives with his surviving wife, Batou. He had two wives, one of whom, Touren, died a month ago. He had five children by each of his wives and some of them live with him. Others have married and moved away."
For Non‐Agency Adoption,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/20/archives/for-nonagency-adoption.html,"At a time when there is a severe shortage of adoptable children, there is what amounts to a movement throughout American social‐service agencies, the news media and district attorneys to extinguish independentplacement adoptions and force all adoptive parents and biological mothers to deal with authorized agencies. The individuals who most often seek to adopt independently are middleclass white couples. Because of increased access to abortion and birthcontrol devices, these infants have not been as available recently as they were in other years. In an adoption through an authorized adoption agency, the prospective adoptive parents are screened by social workers. Because of the scarcity of children, the great majority of applicants are rejected, generally for the sole reason that there are just no children available for placement. An independent adoption occurs when someone who does not go through a domestic agency places out a child for adoption. This can be done by the biological mother who prefers not to deal with an American agency. (Also it is done by agencies outside the United States.) In independent adoptions, the adoptive parents are generally represented by an attorney. Further, there is a court‐ordered investigation by a state social‐service agency before final court approval of the adoption. In the United States, independent placements account for over 50 percent of all adoptions. Opponents of independent adoption assert that it is a dangerous system because there is no authorized screening of the prospective parents. This is a highly inflated fear. Someone who will go through the effort and expense of arranging an independent adoption is not likely to be an unfit parent. Furthermore, there could be follow‐up visits by a representative of a state agency after an independent placement has been made. The parents could underwrite the cost of the visit; this would provide for the monitoring that opponents seem to think is necessary and still be far less costly — and demeaning — than the agency route. A middle‐income couple often spends more than $2,000 to adopt an infant through an authorized agency. For the taxpayer, added to this is the cost of the salary of the social workers, the cost of medical expenses, and the cost of keeping an infant in foster care for three to six months before placing the child with adoptive parents. The overall cost, mostly footed by the taxpayer, could exceed $8,000. For the same couple to adopt independently, there would usually be a cost for transportation, medical expenses for the biological mother and child, and a higher legal fee, but still the cost of independent adoption is frequently less than that of agency adoption. Independent adoption offers both the biological mother and the adoptive parents the option of conducting their affairs more privately, without the bureaucracy and intrusion of social‐service agencies. The children also benefit since, with independent placement, the child is usually placed wilh the adoptive parents immediately, whereas in agency adoption there can be a delay of three to six months or more before the child is placed. The agencies’ stake in adoptions is purely economic. They receive a daily payment per child in foster care. Thus. the more children they control, the more money they get from government. A 1978 report by the New York City Comptroller, Harrison Goldin, presented terrifying evidence of agency abuse of children. It concluded that out of all foster children who should have been freed for adoption, 7 percent were freed on time, 20 percent were freed eventually, and fully 73 percent were never freed but remained in perpetual foster care. The public's understanding of independent placement of children is often damaged by the news media, which frequently are delighted to accentuate sensationalism and distort facts, especially if “Baby Selling” can be fitted into a headline. Although there are occasional abuses in independent placements, the media tend to exploit every situation. Sadly, district attorneys sometimes follow that line. The fact is that independent‐placement adoptions should continue to remain an alternative to agency adoptions. So, there is a kind of triumverate of the agencies, media and district attorneys trying to create a situation whereby every couple not capable of producing children must humble themselves before a committee of social workers who will decide who is and is not ‘'qualified” to adopt children. The only group who is hardly ever heard from are the adoptive parents, the only ones who have anything at stake and something to lose. Their forced silence leaves no opposition to the false ideas propounded by groups with only economic interests."
‘The Kind of Issue You Can't Wiry’,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/22/archives/long-island-weekly-the-kind-of-issue-you-cant-win-politics.html,"ALTHOUGH party leaders do not usually intervene in legislative votes on such sensitive issues as abortion, the issue of Medicaid funds for abortions came close to being a party‐line vote in the latest — but undoubtedly not the last struggle over the issue in the State Lesislature. Long Island Republicans voted unanimously to cutoff Medicaid money for abortions except in cases of rape, incest and it threat to the life of the mother. A strong majority of the Democratic legislators from the Island voted In favor of such funds. Of the eight Long Island Democratic legislators, only two — Assemblymen I. William Blanchi of Bellport and George Hochbrueckner of Coram —voted to cut off the funds, One Democrat, Assemblyman Paul Harenberg of Bayport, did not vote ‘but said in a statement that he supported payment by Medicaid. The near party‐line division was reflected overall when the Democraticcontrolled Assembly yotedlo retain the Medicaid financing while the Republican‐dominated Senate voted to end it. An impasse that held up passage of the entire state budget for several days was resolved when the Senate backed down and permitted Medicaid financing. Beyond the cold voting rolls, however, were personal and pblitfcal decisions by legislators who will be hearing about those decision if they seek reelection 19 months from now. Clearlythe Long Island legislator on the hotlest spot was Assem blyman Angelo F. Orazio of Albertson A Democrat, he went along with the majority of his party and voted for the Medicaid funds. What makes him particularly vulnerable on such aesensitive vote is that be won by only 29 votes last November. Re ran against a strong Republican‐Con POLITICS servative, John S. Da Vanzo, the North Hempstead town clerk, but the antiabortion Right to‐Life Party did not have a line on the ballot then. It will next year and Mr. Orazio almost certainly will not be on it. Mr. Orazio noted that among the many anti‐abortion visitors he and other legislators have had in the last two months was Mary Jane Tobin, the Right to Life Partys gubernatorial candidate last year. She reminded him that she had received 1,800 votes in his Assembly district, with the obvious implication that such a bloc of votes could be turned a aiast him. Yet Mr. Orazio, a Roman Catholic who said he personally opposes abortion but believes it should not be subject to legislation, asserted that he was not concerned about his political future. He said that most or all of the 1,800 votes were probably against him last year because his position was clear then, too, while his opponent sided with the anti‐abortion groups. “If I were going to be defeated, that was the time to do it,” he said. The antiabortion forces can claim the scalp of at least one Long Island legislator, former Assemblyman Vincent R. Balletta, a Republican who was defeated in the adjacent district several years ago largely, Republican politicians believe, because of a vote to liberalize the abortion law. A political realist, Mr. Orazio did not try to portray himself as a potential martyr. Re said that he believed he represented the views of his Democratic constituency in the district, which takes in Roslyn, Westbury and Mineola. He reported that the district was about 50 percent Catholic, 25 percent Jewish and 25 percent Protestant. However, the Jewish vote would comprise a larger portion of tite Democratic balloting in a primary. Noting that two other Democratic members of the Assembly from potentially marginal districts, May Newburger of Great Neck and Lewis J. Yevoli of Old Bethpage, had also supported the Medicaid funds, Mr. Orazio said, “Were we to change our position, we would lose our Democratic constituency.” “It's the kind of issue you can't win,” Assemblyman Yevoli echoed. It is also the kind of issue and arena that will provide a test of the new Right to Life Party's strength on a local level. The Island is its bastion, with three leaders of the party all from there. They are Mrs. Tobin and Ellen McCor mack, who ran for the Democratic. Presidential nomination in 1976, both of Merrick, and Donald A. Doyle of Commack. If they cannot flex their political’ muscles on the Island, they are not likely to do so elsewhere."
EXPERTS MONITORING RADIATION'S EFFECTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/22/archives/experts-monitoring-radiations-effecfs-studies-focus-on-people.html,"WASHINGTON, April 21 — When engineers released radioactive steam from the crippled Three Mile Island nuclear plant into the Pennsylvania air late last month, scientists began planning to study the effects of precisely measured doses of low‐level radiation, although some scientists say that the doses may have been too small to show significant results. Unlike other studies being carried out, this one in the rolling farmland around Middletown, Pa., involves not just workers or military personnel but also. children, pregnant women and old people. Scientists will have better data on radiation dosages than ever before, said John C. Villforth, who, as director of the Bureau of Radiological Health of the Food and Drug Administration, has been deeply involved in gathering and processing the information. “There is going to be an attempt to better describe and define things than before,” he said. Two Reasons for Follow‐Up A long‐term health study of workers at the plant, women who were pregnant at the time of the accident and their children when they are born, and a sample of the general public was announced by Joseph A. Califano Jr., the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, in testimony before a Senate subcommittee this month. There will be so few health problems resulting from the accident that “we will be unable to trace them,” predicted Dr. Arthur C. Upton, director of the National Cancer Institute, an expert on the biological effects of radiation. But he said a follow‐up would be useful to verify predictions and to reassure people that the matter was being taken seriously. Regardless of what studies are carried out by Federal agencies, Dr. Gordon MacCleod, State Health Commissioner of Pennsylvania, said, “My intention is multiyear study.” Radiation Effects Debated Since atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki toward the close of World War II, exposing large numbers of people to high‐level radiation for the first time, scientists have sharply debated the effects of low‐level radiation on human beings. Soldiers and children exposed to radiation in the Nevada nuclear tests of the 1950's were found to have suffered leukemia at a rate double that among the unexposed population. Exposure to certain low levels can cause cancer, birth defects and spontaneous abortion, in some cases up to 30 years after the initial exposure, scientific studies have shown. The level of radiation that scientists consider safe has steadily dropped since a standard was first established in 1925 at 1,000 millirems a week. A millirem measures the absorption of radiation by humans, with a chest X‐ray exposing a person to 20 to 30 millirems. The current standard is 5,000 millirems a year, or just under 100 a week, below which, Some argue, no significant health problem will develop even over a period of decades. Standard Is Challenged However, sharp challenges to this have arisen in the last few years, and Many scientists believe that the health hazards of low‐level radiation have been underestimated; they believe that all exposure should‐be avoided since there is no known level of absolute safety. “Virtually every responsible radiation body has accepted the hypothosis that there is no dose of radiation so smalls to do no harm,” Dr. Upton said a month before the Three Mile Island accident. Nevertheless, many scientists contend that the doses of radiation received by people because of the accident were so small as to make a scientific experiment all but impossible. “I heard one person say. ironically think, ‘Gee, isn't it too bad we didn't let higher dosage,’” one scientist reported. The highest cumulative dosage received by anyone at the plant was 100 millirems, according to MacCleod. The average exposure apt those living within a mile of the plant Was 45 to 50 millirems, and that dropped to 30 millirems for those living two to three miles from the punt. he said. Natural Levels Differ These figures have been challenged, however, and some Government seientists expect the exposure level to be raised when additional information is received. “If everyone in this population got a dose of 80 millirems. which they didn't, on top of the dose received from natural radiation, it would have been the same as if we transferred the population to Denver for one year,” said Mr. Villforth. Natural radiation levels vary geographically, with the dose from cosmic rays higher in certain places, such as Deaver, because of their elevation. According to an interim Government report assessing the doses and the asks as of April 3, it is not likely that there will be a single case of fatal cancer as a result of the accident among the two million people living within 50 miles of the pant. The normal cancer mortality rate of a population of that size is 3,692 a year. 50 More Deaths Feared A more pessimistic view was expressed by Paul Miley, assistant professor of community medicine at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, who said that there might be 50 additional cancer deaths in Pennsylvania. “These cancers will appear to be at random. spontaneous and without cause,” be wrote in an article in The New York Times. Whatever the physical effects. scientists have been left with one other result of the nuclear accident to study. “The unique opportunity may not relate to the dosage of radiation, which is so low, but rather the impact psychologically of living in an atmosphere of concern over radiation exposure.” said Dr. MacCleod. “That these people were exposed to the apprehension of a radiation exposure is unique in the history of man.”"
Judge Suspends Abortion Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/22/archives/judge-suspends-abortion-law.html,"LINCOLN, Neb., April 21 (AP) — A Federal judge has ordered Nebraska not to enforce portions of a recently passed abortion law until a trial can be held to resolve constitutional challenges to the measure. District Judge Warren K. Urbom yesterday suspended portions of the new law pending a trial July 18. One section suspended by the judge prohibits an abortion from being performed until 48 hours after a woman has given her consent."
Chinese Law Eases Divorce — Or Does It?,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/22/archives/chinese-law-eases-divorce-or-does-it-education-not-denunciation.html,"SHANGHAI, April 18 — It could almost have been a tale out of an old Chinese novel. The irate woman, angered by her husband's filial devotion to his parents rather than to her and by her mother‐in‐law's scorn when she failed to give birth to a son, sued for divorce. Under a liberal divorce law decreed by the Communists to lessen what they view as the oppression of traditional family life, she was entitled to the divorce, because her husband's family, which she had been forced to live with, was guilty of what the Communists term feudal thinking. But in practice, as Wei Jinfeng, 35 years old, found out in a protracted court mediation session here that was opened to visiting American legislators, asking for a divorce can be asking for trouble. It goes against the feeling for social harmony and economic efficiency and it exposes a married couple to the full force of community pressure. After a two‐and‐a‐half‐hour debate involving Miss Wei, her husband, a judge, two assessors, or jurors, and half a dozen representatives from the couple's work places and neighborhood, Miss Wei agreed to a reconciliation. Only she had argued for the divorce. “At present our country is carrying out the four modernizations,” the judge told her, referring to the Government's economic development program in agriculture, science and technology, defense and industry. “Our country needs stability and unity, so families must practice stability and unity also.” Education, Not Denunciation “Our duty is to educate people, not to attack them,” he counseled both Miss Wei and her husband, Hung Sungdao, a 39‐year‐old clerk in an import‐export office. Their names differ because in China a woman does not adopt the husband's name. The judge and the others who urged the couple to get back together did not use the term love, which is officially regarded as a suspiciously decadent Western bourgeois conceit. Instead, a co‐workerof Miss Wei's at the Shanghai Meteorological Instrument Factory advised, what they needed was to base their marriage “on a good political understanding,” such as she had with her husband. The remark elicited a titter from spectators. The proceedings, held in a compound belonging to the local district committee, were witnessed by a delegation of the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee, headed by Frank Church, Democrat of Idaho, its chairman. The group, which included Senator Jacob K. Davits of New York, the ranking Republican member, was on a six‐day tour of China. Foreigners are seldom permitted to witness court cases, so the hearing offered an unusual insight into features of life under the Communists: the strength of peer pressure, the persistence of such traditional values as filial piety and the ready resort to Commu‘Mist phraseology in everyday life. ‘Freedom of Divorce’ Miss Wei, who held her 5‐year‐old daughter on her lap during much of the session, applied for a divorce in August. If both partners agree, “there is freedom of divorce,” the judge, Li Haiqing,lained. Divorce can also be granted, said, in cases of adultery or if the couple did not have a chance to get to know each other well before marrying or when one partner is discriminated against because of the lingering “poison of feudal thinking,” as in Mr. Hung's case. The law calls for attempts at reconciliation before a divorce Is approved. As Miss Wei described her situation, their “contradiction,” the Maoist term for troubles, began when she gave birth to a daughter instead of a son. Male offspring have traditionally been more treasured because they can earn more and stay with their parents after mar. rage. A daughter is Ilke spilled water, according to an old saying, because she moves to her in‐laws after marriage. When Miss Wei came home from the maternity hospital, she told the court, her mother‐in‐law greeted her by holding up a male infant, a sign designed to insure that she would have a boy next time. Later the two women quarreled over how much Miss Wei ate, and the contradiction sharpened when she secretly had an abortion, fearing the consequences of another daughter. Miss Wei then moved out, taking a small room for herself and her child, and demanded that her husband give her their share of the family's ration cards for the many essentials that are strictly rationed. The Husband's Version Differs Her husband recalled the story differently, testifying that she showed no respect for his parents, smashed much of the furniture in anger, ripped his clothes one day when they met on the street and went to his office over 140 times to complain about his behavior. Still, he did not want a divorce. After husband and wife finished testifying, some of the people they work and live with took turns urging them to make up. “You should carry out more ideological work with your mother to correct her feudal thinking,” a man told the husband. “In our society woman can be airplane pilots, like men, so girls are not less good than boys.” What finally seemed to sway Miss Wei was concern for her daughter, who, she said, blamed her for the troubles. When she related this she began to sob, producing tears from several of the witnesses. It is difficult to gauge how widespread is the old‐fashioned thinking encountered by Miss Wei. A woman interpreting the case for Senator Church commented: “I didn't have the same problem. My child is a boy, and my mother‐in‐law can't bear to be separated from him.”"
Learning About China Is Becoming a Living Reality,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/22/archives/learning-about-china-is-becoming-a-living-reality.html,"THE “China syndrome” has hit American education, and postnormalization trips to the Far East never had it so good. Although trips to Israel, the Continent, Mexico and the Soviet Union were once de rigueur for eager students, under the premise that travel is broadening, the new friendliness between the United States and China has inspired scores of student visits from all social, economic and educational classes of American society. The new interest is now stretching into the elementary schools. Among the upcoming trips is the 8,060 mile 18‐day journey to be taken by 15 eighth‐graders from New York's Bank Street School for Children. The students are led by Tang Yungmei, a Chinese‐born educator whose mother, Han Suyin, is a noted biographer of Mao Tse‐Tung and a longtime advocate of better Sino‐American relations. The Bank Street visit is only part of the larger Western convergence on China, however. Almost 25,000 Americans are expected to visit China this year, and students across the country who want to go have been busily promoting raffles, cake sales and fundraising banquets, visiting the Asian collection at their local museums, and tak ing crash courses in Chinese history, culture and poetry. In Detroit, a group. of 22 inner‐city students returned last month from a 19day visit. The trip followed almost a year and a half of contacts with the Chinese International Travel Service in Peking, lectures by experts who had been to China and fund‐raising efforts. “A couple of years ago,” said.Valentine Kass, a member of the U.S.‐China Peoples Friendship Association, “the organizers of this trip went on one of the Friendship Association's tours to China and came back very excited. They started talking to friends from southwestern Detroit, largely from the Puerto Rican, Chicano, Latino and black community who wanted to go.” The group, ranging in age from 13 to 22, wanted to visit China for a variety of reasons. “Some wanted to see family life,” Mrs. Kass said, “others how schools are run, what a young person's life is like growing up in China, and medical care.” The Friendship Association, setup to promote people‐to‐people relations between Chinese and Americans, has helped most of the stúdent groups prepare for their trip, dealing with such matters as where to stay, what to see, and how to get around. In addition to the New York and Detroit people, groups from Boston, Denver, Philadelphia and Darien, Conn., have made trips in recent years or plan one soon. Miss Yungmei organized the group because her daughter Karen, who has visited China twice before, has attended the Bank Street School for some time. They will be accompanied by Bank Street administrator Pearl Zeitz, Joshua Robison, a former Bank Street teacher, and Bruce Davidson, the photographer, who will make a record of the trip. He is the father of two Bank Street students who are too young to go. “I had home visits of an hour with each of the parents to see how serious their commitment was,” Miss Yungmel said. “I didn't want just people who could afford the trip out of their own pocket.” The journey, which will begin May 1 and end May 28, will cost about $2,250 a person. The Bank Street students are taking tapes of the “Saturday Night Fever” soundtrack and Billy Joel's albums to present to the Chinese, as part of cultural exchange, along with a scrapbook of snapshots by Mr. Davidson of students at home and around the city. To the new group of visitors to China, people like John Catalini, an English teacher at Keefe Technical High School in Framingham, Mass., who led group of 15 students from Keefe and Lincoln‐Sudbury High School in April 1977, have become old hands. “Our trip cost about 31,800 per person,” Mr. Catalina said. “We visited big rice commune near: Canton for a couple of days, and also went’ to a school for deaf mutes because we had a hearing‐impaired student in the group.” “I was very impressed with education there,” said Tray Aronson, one of the Lincoln‐Sudbury group. “The students are very committed, eager to learn, enthusiastic, and work very hard. I was impressed by the respect they show teachers.” What, if anything, does the Bank Street group feel they have in common with their Asian counterparts? “Well, we're all children,” said Ellen Nachtigall, who, as a budding , gym. nast, is interested in the style of her Asian counterparts. “We were more interested in social life and issues like birth control and abortion than they,” Tracy. Aronson said. “They were embarrassed when we brought up sex. They were more interested in whether we were‐guaranteed a job after we got out of school.” Louisa Gross, now coordinator of special education at Antioch College's Philadelphia offide, led a 19‐student group from the Neighborhood Education and Counseling Center, Simon Gratz High School and other schools: Dr. Donald Robbins, principal of Darien High School in Connecticut, who led a group of his school's students to China last April, has humbling memories of the journey. “We took over a portion of our state gymnastics team, but they put all the best athletes in an area in a special school, called the 'spare‐time’ school, and train them in. sports,” Dr. Robbins recalled. “And we can't talk about ping‐pong at all!” Danny Rossner, a freckled, husky 13year‐old in the Bank Street group, summed up the feelings of most American students looking to their first trip to a continent that Westerners have known so little about for so long. “I've always wanted to go to foreign places,” he said, “and China is about as far away as you can go.”"
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/22/archives/letters-toward-a-constitution-fit-for-the-21st-century-amtrak-vs.html,"To the Editor: The failure to date of the U.S. energy program may suggest to thoughtful observers something more deeply wrong with American government than the usual obstacles encountered in politics. Fundamental features of the U.S. political system make it virtually impossible for Presidents to form governing coalitions capable of acting decisively on collective issues such as energy. These familiar obstacles include: the archaic separation of powers among President, House and Senate; weak leadership and strong committees in Congress; breakdown of the political parties; the overweening orientation of legislators toward re‐election, and an electoral system based on geography, which tends to produce parochial responses to national problems. It is unreasonable to expect elected leaders to correct these defects; such reforms are not within the scope, of their authority and would not be in their self‐interest. Consequently, citizens outside the normal political process must somehow require officeholders to experiment with new mechanisms of governance. One of the few nonviolent possibilities is a new constitutional convention. The nearly uniform opposition to such a convention by liberal intellectuals appears unwarranted. The prevailing fear is that a convention might reduce hard‐won civil liberties, including rights to abortion, but it is unlikely that amendments introducing severe deprivations of currently accepted civil liberties could achieve ratification by three‐fourths of the states. Against any such risk must be set the possible gains of a constitutional convention. Even if every action it took turned out to be wrong, and that is unlikely, a new convention would re‐legitimate the old idea that the people have a right to reconstitute their government when it is not working. Simply to undermine Americans’ unreflective allegiance to the Constitution of 1787 would be an enormous contribution to future political creativity. Perhaps it will take several efforts at constitution‐building before we arrive at a new system that is appropriate for the 21st century. It seems past time to begin the task. EDWARD J. WOODHOUSE Dallas, April 11, 1979 The writer teaches at Southern Methodist University. Amtrak vs. Its Passengers To the Editor: The plea by Mr. Kenefick for Congress to reject the Department of Transportation's planned cutbacks in Amtrak Service (letter April 8) misses the mark. As a recent Amtrak passenger for more than 5,000 miles, I can attest to the fact that Amtrak management has neither the desire nor the inclination to make rail travel a sensible, attractive alternative to air, bus or car travel. Problems range from unhealthy and unsafe conditions in the rolling stock to surly employees, although I found the variability both among and within trains extraordinary. As long as Amtrak can count on Federal bailout amounting to two‐thirds of its operating revenue, it should be apparent that there will be no incentive to improve the situation and compete in the travel market. Adding rail coaches and adding passengers are mutually exclusive propositions in the context of current Amtrak operations. Unless and until rail transportation becomes attractive to the fare‐paying passenger, discussion of passengermiles per gallon of fuel is not only irrelevant but ludicrous as well. My solution to the problem is to eliminate the Federal subsidy to Amtrak of $600 million‐plus, let the system collapse of its own dead weight and start over from scratch by determining what the public wants and how much it is willing to pay for it. I have no doubt that a profit‐making, tax‐paying venture could result. The present situation only postpones the inevitable day of reckoning when the beleaguered taxpayer wakes up to find he is being ripped off in yet another area. IRA CHARAK Western Springs, Ill., April 11, 1979 The Unkept Promise Of No‐Fault Insurance To the Editor: New York State Superintendent of Insurance Albert B. Lewis has announced that five insurance companies have agreed to rebate 4 to 16 percent of their premium insurance receipts. While the fact that these rebates are coming at all is encouraging, it is certainly long overdue and may be a situation of too little too late. A rollback in insurance rates of 15 to 40 percent was promised by the Insurance Department when no‐fault insurance was first enacted in 1973. Six years passed with no reduction in automobile insurance rates. In fact, as any motorist in New York State will tell you, scores of drivers have been placed in the “assigned risk” pool, and all have seen their insurance rates double. Considering the fact that the insurance industry has seen a net profit of $9.36 billion from investment income and underwriting profit on property and casualty liability, according to the Insurance Information Institute, a reduction of from 4 to 16 percent cannot be seen as a significant breakthrough. And the views of countless motorists who have been denied their right to sue for psychological and bodily injury cannot go overlooked. SHERIDAN ALBERT President New York State Trial Lawyers Assn. New York, April 13, 1979 As Superpowers Vie On Third‐World Turf To the Editor: Sometimes a significant revelation comes through in a casual observation. The Times reported in a recent news story that Zbigniew Brzezinski, speaking for the SALT accord, indicated that “Washington and Moscow would continue to compete for global influence, particularly in third‐world trouble spots.” While competition of the great powers for influence is always disturbing, how much more so is a declared intention to follow such practice in third‐world trouble spots. These develop typically when third‐world nations recurrently initiate struggles to find ways out of their miseries. Under such conditions it seems overbearing and hurtful for the superpowers to extend their own ‘competitions, which they dare not extend to each other's territory, onto the premises of thirdworld nations. The United States experience in Vietnam and Iran suggests that involvement in trouble spots might open the way to failure. On the evidence, it seems that we do not understand very well how to cope with the struggles that continue in the third world. How can we succeed in competition that we do not understand? Beyond that, judgment should tell both Washington and Moscow that the fuse for nuclear Armageddon could be set by involvement in the trouble spots of other nations. JOHN G. DOW Albany, April 17, 1979 Perilous Progress To the Editor: Stanley Bosworth [letter April 14) vents his ire on “naysayers.” Those of us opposed to continued development and use of nuclear power are not opposed to progress, only wary of its definition. We don't want to put out the fires of progress. We just prefer not to be consumed by them. YVONNE S. ARCHER New York, April 16, 1979 Catholicism's Early View on Celibacy To the Editor: The stern directive of, Pope John Paul II has, reaffirmed the traditional view of Catholicism on the celibacy of the clergy. It is important, however, to iemember that the early church held to a different view. There exists an ancient canon, which emanated from a church council of which we do not know the locale, dating from the second or third century. The text can be found in Karl Joseph von Hefele's “History of the Church Councils.” The Greek original is there translated into Latin, and is as follows: “If the bishop, priest or deacon, or any cleric whatsoever, shall refrain from marriage and from meat and from wine, not for the sake of discipline but with contempt, and, forgetful that all things are very good and that God made man, male and female, blasphemously inveighs against creation (biasphemans accusaverit creationem), let him be either corrected or deposed and turned out of the Church (atque ex Ecctesia ejiciatur). And so also with the layinen.” The historian wonders what philosophical influence or ecclesiastical interests have changed and contradicted such a statement. It is easy to think of Manicheanism, for example. But the Pope asks a rhetorical question when he differentiates between the celibate state and the married state for the laity: “Do we wish thereby to reduce the value of mariiage and the vocation to family life? Or are we succumbing to a Manichean contempt for the human body and its functions?” Those who find the Pope's logic unsatisfactory may find relief in the statement of this canon from the early church. But the question remains, Why was it so ignored in the history of the church? URSULA M. NIEBUHR Stockbridge, Mass., April 17, 1979 An ‘H‐2’ Alternative to Holding Back Farm Mechanization To the Editor: The report by Seth King on the troubles of mechanization in farming (Week in Review April 8) exaggerates the problem as regards the farm labor force and ignores the available solution via the “H‐2” program. The total number of “farmers” in the U.S. today (as counted most inclusively by the Department of Agriculture) is just over four million workers, not eight million as stated by Mr. King, apparently giving the total farm population. And the number of “hired farm workers” within the former total is, as an annual average, about 1.3 million, the 21 million shown in Mr. King's graphoounts in all persons who did any hired farm work during the year, but three‐fourths of them worked for less than 150 days in the year (Department of Agriculture annual report “The Hired Farm Working Force”). Equally important, the reported decline of jobs for migratory harvest workers — a 10 percent drop last year — takes little or no account of the rising numbers of “undocumented aliens,” who come mostly from Mexico and mostly are not reached by the annual population sample. These foreign migrants are helping to fill the harvest needs, at a large gain in earnirrs for themselves and usually without settling down as a local problem population. Under increasing mechanization, as Mr. King points out, “farmers need hired help for only a couple of weeks at planting time. and again at harvest.” Such help is already being supplied to the apple‐picking operation by “H‐2” workers: foreign labor, mostly from Jamaica, brought in legally for a few weeks, under Department of Labor supervision so as to avoid any “adverse effect” upon the employment, wages and Working conditions of American labor. It is economically unsound and operationally hopeless to try to hold back farm mechanization, in the hope of preserving the jobs of American farm workers in short‐period work of low productivity and correspondingly low pay. And the attempt can only be at the expense of the consumers as wen as the growers. Those Americans must be Sided to shift to occupations where productivity and pay over the whole year are in accord with U.S. standards. Meanwhile, the remaining farm work should go increasingly to H‐2 foreign workers. Indeed, an expanded program of supervised H‐2 admissions, applied to categories of “low‐level jobs” besides farm wotk, would go far to meet our economic needs while safeguarding our labor standards. Furthermore, the H‐2's would tend to absorb the jobs that currently are attracting huge illegal inflows, which are very hard to control directly. These potentialities are explored in a study. “Policy Dimensions of the H‐2 Program,” which the undersigned has recently prepared for the National Commission for Manpower Policy (to be published in June).

Gallup Poll Finds Little Change in Views on Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/22/archives/gallup-poll-finds-little-change-in-views-on-abortion-catholics-in.html,"The public's attitude toward abortion has changed very little in recent years, despite the intense and well publicized clashes between anti‐abortion forces and those who favor of abortions under certain circumstances, according to the latest Gallup Poll. Those interviewed were asked to place themselves in one of three categories. Twenty‐two percent thought abortion should be legal under all circumstances, while 54 percent felt abortion should legal under only certain circumstances. Nineteen percent of those surveyed felt that abortion should be illegal under all circumstances. That same percentage took a similar view in a survey in 1977. In 1975, 22 percent of those surveyed took this stand. The number of people who think all abortion should be legal and the number who favor abortion under certain circumstances closely parallels those recorded in 1975 and 1977 as well. Catholics in Mainstream Although the Roman Catholic Church strenuously opposes abortion under all circumstances, the poll indicates that most Catholics do not agree with their church's view. Only 25 percent of the Catholics interviewed felt that abortion should be illegal under all circumstances, indicating that a cross‐section of Cahn lics feel no different about the subject than does the American public as a whole. The poll also attempted to examine the situations that would justify abortion to the 54 percent who felt that it should be legal under certain circumstances. This group was provided with six of the most common reasons for abortion: If a woman's life in endangered, if the woman's mental health is endangered; if the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest; if there is a chance the baby will be born deformed; if the woman might suffer severe physical health damage, and if the prospective parents cannot afford to have the child. The group was then asked to indicate which of these reasons were justifiable in the first, second and final three months of pregnancy. The results indicate that both the particular circumstances and the stage of pregnancy contribute importantly to their attitude. For example, in the most widely accepted view, 78 percent felt that abortion was justified when a woman's life was endangered and she was in the first three months of pregnancy. However, only 59 percent felt the endangerment of a woman's life was sufficient cause if the pregnancy was in the final three months. The inability of prospective parents to afford a child was found to be the least defensible ground. Fifteen percent found this reason justifiable if the abortion were to occur. in the first three months. Only 4 percent found it sufficient cause if the pregnancy was in its final three months. The survey, taken from Feb. 23 to Feb. 26, included 1,539 adults who were interviewed in person. The margin for error in a sample that size is plus or minus three percentage points."
WASHINGTON AN INSIDER's GAME,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/22/archives/washington-an-insiders-game-washington.html,"Americans believe that the Washington apparatus has a life of its own, that it does not matter who is in or out of power. The Federal bureaucracy absorbs all invaders, spinning more soft silk about its cocoon. More than any other period of American history, the decade of the 70's is the time when the seat of the Federal Government has become the national center for the petition of grievances. Millions have marched here, lobbied here. rought pitched battles with troops and police here, bought and extracted influence here for causes just and unjust, for private and public privilege, fora share of the half‐billion dollars a year handed out by the Federal treasury. And in recent years, the national Government itself has become a major source of grievance. Across the country, politicians are saying that the current tax revolt is really aimed at Washington, which is perceived as wasteful, indifferent and inpenetrable. And they see the move to call a constitutional convention to require the Federal Government to keep a balanced budget as an extension of the tax revolt. Albert H. Quie, the mild‐mannered studious Republican from Minnesota, served two decades In the House of Representatives before deciding that Washington had gotten so out of touch with the country that he had to get out. He returned home last year and ran successfully for governor. The other day he returned for a meeting of the National Governors Association and said quietly, “The people are feeling as strongly about the Federal Government now as they did about the King of England at the time of the Revolution.” in Washington, there are those who attribute the uprising to a middle class that has become self‐centered and cynical about government at all levels, whether good or bad. Others say that after a quarter century of expanding prosperity many Americans now find the good life slipping from them and are striking out at the largest extractor of their taxes. Yet a close look at Washington today makes it hard to dismiss the argument that the national Government serves it self first, that it tolerates inefficiencies and stifles reform. Through prosperity, recession, war and peace, one thing has been consistent: The Federal apparatus centered in Washington has grown and prospered. Washington has been unique since it was superimposed on a swamp on the Potomac a century and a half ago, a geographical compromise that assured it would be almost exclusively a Government town. A generation ago, Washington was a relaxed and plain company town with a strong Southern flavor that those on the Upper Eastern Seaboard considered a trifle boorish. Not anymore. It is now a megapolis of the well‐to‐do, a magnet for some of the best Ivy League graduates, a haven for tens of thousands of middle‐level civil servants who enjoy the equivalent of faculty tenure and who would never do so well in the private sector. Washington, with a metropolitanarea population of three million, consisting chiefly of the government complex and the business people who serve it, has become the per capita wealthiest of the big cities. In 1977, it had a spendable income per (Continued on Page 89) household of almost $23,000, or 33 percent above the national average. In this recessionproof town, the average house sells for $100,000. Here, mile after mile of fine homes stretching out to the farmlands of Virginia and Maryland are occupied by professional couples earning 880,000 to $100,000 or more a year. It is a city of the four‐day weekend, or the seven‐day weekend if any two days of a week are holidays. Here, even the urban poor are made almost invisible by the influx of professionals. And while there is street crime, it is down more than in most cities, partly because the District has 20 different lawenforcement agencies on the streets, a security apparatus that would make a police state Jealous. In the last five years Washington has attracted some of the nation's most expensive shopping centers. It is the nation's leading market for new cars, especially classy imports. All of this, some say, has bred insensitivity to the needs of the rest of the nation that supplies all the wealth. By now, many Americans believe that the Washington apparatus has a life of its own, that it does not matter who is President or who gets elected to Congress or which party is in or out of power. Washington has its own way of absorbing invaders and malcontents. The new chairman of the Federal Communications Commission ordered his employees to change their work hours — 9:30 to 5:30 instead of 8:30 to 4:30 — so that people on the West Coast would not find the office closed at 1:30 P.M. their time. The order raised such a howl that it was redrawn to include only new emYees A few years ago, John McLaughlin, then a Jesuit priest, came to Washington as an anti‐Washington‐establishment speechwriter for Richard Nixon (he became known as one of Mr. Nixon's ardent defenders during the Watergate scandal). Today, he is a prosperous consultant to business corporations, advising them on what is likely to hap. pen on such questions as the limitation of strategic arms, environmental enforcement and bottle disposal. A Republican administra.. tion, it was once believed, is good for reforming, trimming and reorganizing innovations put in place by impractical Democrats. During the eight years of the Nixon and Ford Administrations, high officials brought in to do something about government traveled the country, as did the two Presidents, decrying Washington bigness and interference and preaching decentralization. Yet during that period Federal regulation took a quantum jump, and layer after layer of bureaucracy and confusion was added. In his first term, Mr. Nixon yielded to political pressures in order to get elected to a second, and thus he went along with new programs and regulations enacted by the Democratic Congress. In his second term, Mr. Nixon sought to gain control of the Government through a centralization that included the placing of political appointees in permanent positions in the civil service. Jimmy Carter himself ran for President on an anti‐Washington platform. Now, he too has been impaled. His reorganization team wanted to combine many of the programs that overlap and cause confusion — in the urban and economic‐development areas, for example. But interest groups from mayors to business leaders registered so much oppositon that the plan never got out of the White House. Mr. Carter's zero‐based budgeting, which will make every agency justify its existence from the beginning — is virtually forgotten. His budget restraints are aimed at controllable domestic items, not at throwing out programs that do not work. He learned his lesson when his attempt to stop construction of dubious water projects angered much of the West. And Mr. Carter's attempts at reforming the civil service have fared no better. After years of shoring up one kind of protection or another for Government workers, the civilservice bureaucracy has made it virtually impossible to fire incompetents. When be first took office, Mr. Carter waded mm this gnagteire like a marine fresh out of boot camp, but he soon found himself up against employee unions, the civil servants who make up a sizable constituency of the Washington area, and court decisions which have held that Government jobs cannot be denied without due process. The result of Mr. Carter's efforts at reform has been a series of compromises that still leave a formidable array of procedures that will have to be exhausted before an incompetent can be fired. Time is on the side of the Government worker; the civil service has a way of waiting out and wearing down every reform effort. Some have referred to the Washington of today as Versailles‐on‐the‐Potomac. But this does not quite fit, not when members of the court — those closest to the President work 15 hours a day. Others see only the corrupting influence of power. An axiom in the newspaper business has it that any good reporter on any day in any city can go out and get a story on corruption and misuse of funds in the General Services Administration or the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act programs, to name two Federal functions that have become notorious for their corruption in the lower ranks. The corruption, some say, is an inevitable offshoot of modern politics — with its singleissue interest groups all operating independently of one another; fragmentation of authority in the Congress; the runaway financing of Congres. sional campaigns by special interests; the decline in public confidence in government. The Washington of today might more aptly be described as a medieval fair, with all manner of people doing their juggling acts, bartering, agitating, cajoling, preaching, stealing. By now everyone has gotten the word: If you are going to accomplish anything in this country, you must go to Washington and setup a booth. It is everyone for himself. It can be great fun for the participants, but don't expect those left in Peoria to understand what is going on. In effect, there are now‐ as there have been since the late 1960's — two governments. The government of the Eisenhower era remains, with its center in the White House. There, in concert with Congress, the President can control to some degree foreign policy, the Pentagon and the Federal budget. He can do things like decree more aid to the South Bronx. He can wheel and deal with Congress on public works, water projects, highway construction. He can make his policies felt through appointments. Americans understand this government and know that certain excesses in politics and the bureaucracy are to be expected. This government can be controlled, after a fashion, by the democratic processes. It is the other, more complex government which is not only out of control but which has been superimposed over the older government. This second government is one owned not by the public but piece by piece by interest groups mayors, veterans, homebuilders, poor people, rich people, the handicapped, police chiefs, farmers, the auto industry, the elderly, truckers, or by people purporting to represent them. It is not a new phenomenon, but what was once a mouse is now an elephant. This government has no center. Instead — in a democracy gone rampant — a multitude of groups clamor for a positive response from the Federal Government. Neither the President nor the leadership of Congress in recent years has found a way to get control of the second government, to strengthen what Is good, weed out what is bad and make priorities that are in the national interest. This government is too large and diverse to be publicly understood. Even in Washington, no one knows and understands all of it, only pieces of it. The second government is made up in part by a plethora of regulatory agencies. Eighteen of these, mostly the oldline ones, such as the Interstate Commerce Commission, are independent by law. Congress created them and the President appoints their members. Each was established to protect the people, but the tendency has been for the interest under regulation to gain control of the agency so that the special interest, rather than the public, is protected. At present, there are about 72 other regulatory agencies in the executive branch. New ones include the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (in the Department of Transportation), and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA (in the Labor Depart President Carter, besides offering overall regulatory‐re.form legislation, is trying to gain control of those 60 agencies nominally under his command. After all, somebody has to decide between competing goals — between Jobs and clean water, for example, or inflation and more energy. Whether the President can stand outside the fray to be an effective arbiter of what is best for the country is another matter. The A.F.L.‐C.I.O. has taken the Administration to court in a case involving, among other factors. White House efforts to delay an order by OSHA to establish a lower level of lint in textile plants. OSHA is interested in workers' health; the White House, in worker safety as well as the inflationary impact of such an order. And the issue of control is not likely to be settled soon. Lloyd N. Cutler, a lawyer and member of the American Bar Association's Commission on Law and the Economy, said in regard to regulatory government: “Where Harry Truman was fond of saying, ‘The buck stops here,’ they [the interest groups] prefer a system in which the buck stops nowhere.” A larger part of the second government is composed of about 500 separate grants‐inaid programs, most of them enacted by the Congress in the years since 1965. Each was designed and funded to serve a particular purpose, usually at the urging of some group, but these programs frequently overlap and clash against each other. The town of Junior, W. Va., has spent five years trying to satisfy the conflicting demands of six Federal agencies involved in its effort to build a sewage treatment plant. The programs are easy to start but almost impossible to eliminate because each develops a strong constituency. When Attorney General Griffin Bell first came to Washington, he took one look at the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration — which has handed out billions to police departments without making much impact on crime — and decided the agency had served its purpose and had to go. But the L.E.A.A. is still alive and well; the Carter Administration decided it did not need to have all the police chiefs, sheriffs and mayors in the country on its neck. Furthermore, the programs — for oversight and enabling legislation — are spread among an almost equal number of committees and subcommittees. Any interest strong enough to form a substantial lobby, says Representative David R. Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin and head of a committee that tried to correct some of the fragmentation to the House, can find a port of entry into the Government by attaching itself to a subcommittee. Congress is a land of many entrances but few exits. If a group is blocked at the entrance, such as that supporting a consumer‐protection agency, it is because the lobby against it — in this case, the business lobby — is stronger than the lobby for it. By and large. Government officials are sincere about the programs they oversee and view them as providing needed services. When there is evidence that the programs do not work — such as the seeming inability of a succession of job programs to make a dent on the unemployment rates for young people, particularly minorities — they are brought in for fine tuning. What this usually means, observed Richard W. Boone, acting director of the Field Foundation, a publicinterest group in New York, is the “adding of more technical assistance personnel so that we have an enormous army of middle‐management people who are supposed to be the bridges between the Federal system and the needs of poor people.” This is true of a number of other programs as well, and the personnel added are not always Federal employees. Many programs are run and maintained by “the iron triangle,” a term given currency a couple of years ago by Daniel Evans, then Governor of Washington, who complained that no elected official outside the District of Columbia could penetrate it. An oversimplified definition is that the three sides are made up of (1) the staffs of the Congressional committees involved, (2) that section of the Federal bureaucracy charged with administering the program and (3) the lobby supporting the program. Revolving doors may connect the three sides with professionals moving freely back and forth. Triangles gain control because they write the laws and the regulations, and they run the programs. Members of Congress, the argument goes, cannot give much time to the details because they are too busy acting as ombudsmen for their constituents — that is, defending them from the alleged abuses of other triangles, or seeking services or grants for them. Neither can the White House staff intervene to any degree. There is too much going on for the political appointees, who come in born yesterday with each administration, to follow. Even the Office of Management and Budget, whose 600 or so professionals serve as the President's watchdogs over the entire Government, has only limited effect on what the triangles achieve. Triangles come in all shapes and sizes The veterans triangle is an old one made of the finest of carbon steel. Nobody messes around for long with this triangle. Over the years, it has been able to maintain a steadily growing separate structure of welfare, social and medical services for veterans, and it displayed its strength again last year by defeating President Carter's plan to end veterans’ preference for Government jobs except for those discharged in the past few years. Triangles require more staff. There never seem to be enough Government buildings for the executive branch and appendages — consultants, lawyers, journalists, newsletter writers, think tanks, lobbyists, copying machines by the carloads. And the Senate is erecting its third office building — at a cost of $135 million, according to the latest estimate. What is happening in Washington is a fragmentation that feeds defensiveness. Almost every elected official in Washington from the President on down is an independent, the end result of the steady decline in the party system. The White House has to put together a different coalition for every issue, and frequently it is as dependent on Republicans as Democrats to win a vote. The city is abloom with hundreds of new interest groups, each seeking its own narrow purpose. In the District of Columbia Telephone book there are more than 200 listings under “National Association"": the National Association of Distributive Education Teachers; the National Association of Independent Insurers; the National Association of Mature People; the National Association of Margarine Manufactur Many industries, cities and states send agents to Washington purely for defensive purposes — to see that they are not shortchanged in the great push for money and favorable regulation. Substantial political organizations have grown up around single, narrow issues: anti gun control vs. pro gun control; anti abortion vs. pro choice. The 357,000 or so civil servants who labor in the labyrinths of Government buildings have been pulled and tugged, too, and have become defensive in the process. Government service is a land of extremes. Political appointees and the highest grades of the civil service work much harder and for longer hours than their counterparts in the private sector. The 7‐to‐11 day is nothing unusual, with weekend work as well. However, a number of officials estimate that about 10 percent of workers at various levels of government spend much of their time in passive or active revolt against their superiors. Occasionally, reports of blatant inefficiency will appear in public. In a man‐bites‐dog story, an agricultural official who had been depicted in a news item as having nothing to do but prop his feet on his desk was awarded a medal by fellow employees, who wanted to I show their disapproval of any public criticism of a colleague. A number of Government officials have become discouraged by the bureaucracy and by trying to make programs work against seemingly insurmountable odds. Frequently the difficulty with a program comes from another agency having different goals and priorities. As a result, all involved spend an inordinate amount of time in meetings to resolve the disagreements. Many of the malcontents would bave left except that they could not do as well in either salary or pensions outside government. The existing problems in the civil service explain in part the muddle over consultants. When President Carter took office he asked for the simple facts: How many consultants are there on the Government payroll and how much are they paid? He still does not know. The agencies kept submitting different figures under different definitions of what constituted “consulting arrangements.” The Department of Agriculture, for one, hired a consultant to find out how to cut the cost of meat and poultry inspection. When the findings in the study were challenged by consumers and packers, the department hired another consultant to study the Total The number of consultants probably ranges in the thousands, and some place the cost at about $2 billion a year. Consultants can be useful for performing a limited task in an agency that does not have the expertise to do it itself. But frequently it is easier for an agency to get the job done by a consultant than to move its own employees to do so. And the use of consultants can be a way of getting around the limit on the number of employees. Last year, an audit of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission showed it had tried to conceal the existence of a large force of consultants, including two former Congressmen, who were paid up to $465 a day, more than twice the amount There does not seem to be much awareness in Washington of its being out of sync with the rest of the country, possibly because the standards are different here. Secretary of the Treasury W. Michael Blumenthal, former chairman of Bendix Corporation, said the other day that in business it was the reality of a situation that in the end determined success. “In government there is no bottom line and that is why you can be successful if you appear to be successful.” With one of the largest public‐relations apparatuses anywhere, the executive branch, the Congress and the appendages of government strive each day for the appearance of success. In recent years, probably the most spectacular failure was President Ford's antiinflation program called Whip Inflation NOW (WIN). The White House consistently defended it as effective, until everyone, including Mr. Ford, forgot about it and it died quietly. This practice of living by appearances is in the spirit of the advice given in 1966 by Senator George Aiken, Republican of Vermont, to Lyndon Johnson for ending the Vietnam War: Declare it won and. A lot of people are offering prescriptions for cutting Washington down to size, including a number of Presidential candidates — Jerry Brown, Ronald Reagan, Philip Crane, among others — who seem more determined than Richard Nixon or Jimmy Carter. Some scholars and political leaders believe that certain initiatives now under way will help sort out priorities and result in reforms. One is public financing of Congressional campaigns, which would mean that members of Congress would be less beholden to special interests and thus better able to undo the excesses of the past decade. An Administration bill to achieve that was defeated last year. but it is now before the new Congress. Senator Edmund G. Muskie, Democrat of Maine, and others believe that “sunset” legislation also before Congress would help; it would allow a number of programs to expire unless their continued To achieve deeper change, however, the prescriptions fall into two categories. One would be the revival of strong political parties capable of disciplining their members in order to achieve broad national goals. The Committee for Party Renewal, formed by a group of political scientists, is proposing that if public financing of Compessional campaigns is ever achieved, the money should be funneled through the parties to give them more authority. The second prescription calls for the President to find a way to get control of the jungle of programs and regulatory agencies in order to answer to the people who elected him. Whether any President can inspire enough people to permit this, with all the checks and balances intact, is questionable. Reforms of this kind are easier achieved in a second term, but we may now be in an era of one‐term Presidents. At the same time, there are those who say that a scaleddown role for the Federal Government may be in order, that • Washington may have taken on too much for a country of such diversity. There are a number of things the Federal Government does well: the collection of taxes, the redistribution of income through Social Security and other cash payments to individuals and local governments, and acting as referee and protector of the underdog in a number of areas when the rules are properly prescribed — in civil‐rights and antitrust matters, for example. What it does not do well, according to an abundance of evidence, is in running big, complex, highly structured programs over a number of diverse regions. The money goes too much into enriching the armies of managers and technicians, and although the effects of those 500 Federal programs can be seen everywhere — in colleges, cities, the rural countryside — the loss and slippage between Washington and the local level is enormous. Many of the programs were started with the intention of concentrating the money where it is most needed, in urban and rural slums, in education for the most severely handicapped, in regions having the most economic distress. But Washington almost always finds a way to spread the money around, among the needy and nonneedy, and the conflicts among the regions over Federal‐fund formulas in the past two years have raised the prospect that it will never be any other way. Efforts to decentralize the Federal Government have not worked. People simply bypass the regional offices and go to Washington, where the power is. Trusting state and local governments and other institutions with the programs is fraught with danger, but those who propose doing so say that at least this way the inefficiencies and outrages would be dispersed throughout the country where people could better attack them. And, taking a lesson from China, it might be good for those long established in Washington to get a taste of the provinces. ■"
A Poet's Feminist Prose,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/22/archives/a-poets-feminist-prose-rich.html,"THAT Adrienne Rich is one of America's most Important and gifted poets is of course a known fact here; it is also known abroad, as a year of travel from Tokyo to Sydney to Paris informed this reviewer in 1978. Less well known is her quality as writer of prose. This fact alone justifies the publication ON LIES, SECRETS, AND SILENCE Selected Prose 1966‐1978. By Adrienne Rich. 310 pp. New York: W.W. Norton & Co. $13.95. or this collection of 22 essays that might otherwise be lost, for they originally appeared In such maces as Chrysalis: A Megazine of Women's Culture, Chronicle: of Higher Education, Parnassus: Poetry in Review, Heresies: A Feminist Magasine of Art and Politics, College English, Ms., Sinister Wisdom; as well as the Op‐Ed page of The New York Times. Some were introductions to other people's books, some were talks never primed. Adrienne Rich's prose moves with force, clarity, energy; and soothes with a poet's grace and elegance. The only bad prose in the volume is its title, which conveys a wholly inaccurate idea of whining and whimpering within. Feminism, pedagogy and literature, not lies, secrets and silence, are the subjects covered by her essays. The literary studies are brilliant: on Anne Bradstreet, on “Jane Eyre” and on Emily Dickhumn, about whom Adrienne Rich may have written the single best critical essay we have. On pedagogy she is always interesting, especially when writing about the SEEK program (Search for Education. Elevation and Knowledge) in which she taught at the City College of New York In the late 1960's. “Claiming an Education.” the convocation address she delivered at Douglass, the distinguished women's college of Rutgers University where she now teaches, could be repeated yearly with pleasure and profit to entering college students of both sexes, and must be one of the liveliest models of the genre. She comments: “If university education means anything beyond the processing of human beings Into expected roles, through credit hours, tests, and grades ... it implies an ethical and intellectual contract between teacher and student. ... Too often, all of us fall to teach the most important thing, which is that clear thinking, active discussion, and excellent writing are all necessary for intellectual freedom, and that these require hard work.” On feminist Issues, which loom largest here and affect all her subjects, Adrienne Rich says much that we have heard before from others; but she usually says It better. Feminist readers, who may feel they need not read another word on women's Issues, will find themselves mining this collection for quotable epigrams on such matters as coneciousness raising (“It Is no longer such a lonely thing to open one's eyes”); token women; day-care centers; male psychiatrists (blaming “the waste of [society's] young on the ‘bad’ mothers who have somehow failed to be superhuman”); women's studies; abortion; the problems and challenges of black feminism (“beleaguered ... between the twin grindstones of gynephobia and racism”); sexist advertising and the ever-present threat of rape. She writes: “If it is dangerous for me to walk home late of an evening from the library, because I am a woman and can be raped, how self-possessed, now exuberant can I feel as I sit working in that library? How much of my working energy is drained by the subliminal knowledge that, as a woman. I test my physical right to exist each time I go out alone?” Extreme? Recently, when I left the library of a California university late one afternoon, a woman student came up warn me not to take the direct route to the parking lot through a small wood, as It was the principal scene of campus rape. For the purpose of scholars, Adrienne Rich's most Important feminist subject Is lesbianism, because t.. male homosexuality (of capita importance to modernism in the arts) has a slim bibliography, to which she unfortunately contributes curly a few scattered pages here. Perhaps another book is in view. Antifeminist readers, who do not understand what critical society” means, can learn a lot trim the concert Adrienne Rich makes in her studies of Brontë and Dickison. (The wide‐ranging and hostile overtones given by women to the word patriarchal are hardly of recent coinage. Harriet Beecher Stowe, in her historic letter announcing that she was writing “Uncle Tom's Cabin,” referred to slavery as “the ‘patriarchal institution.’” in “Vesuvius at Home: The Power of Emily Dickinson,” it is with the authority of a woman poet that Adrienne Rich discerns will, power and freedom in Dickinson's poems, many of which “seem to me a poet's poems —that is, they are about the poet's relationship to her own tower, which is exteriorized in masculine form, much as masculine poets have invoked the female Muse.” She roads “He humbles at your Soul” (#315) and “He put the belt around my life” (*273) not as love poems to some never-to-discovered adored male, but as poetry In an ancient mystic tradition in which metaphors “of seduction and rape [are] merged with the Intense force of a religious experience.” In “I'm ceded — I've stopped being Theirs —” (#506) Rich finds the theme not only of confirmatIon but of “self-comfirmation” as a woman: “It is a poem of movement from childhood to womanhood, of transcendIng the patriarchal condition of bearing her father's name and ‘crowing — on my Father's breast —.’ She is now a consciοus Queen Adequate Erect/ With Will to choose or to reject.’ ” From time to time in this volume Adrienne Rich returns to motherhood, the subject treated In “Of Woman Born” (1976). Here I find myself in frequent disagreement, and hope, it I ever meet her, to have a debate based on our mutual experience of mothering during the fearful 1980's. Her interests in the subject run to politics and sexuality; mine to economics and esthetics. But that mothers alone must determine the optimum conditions under which they do the work of motherhood is her central point, on which I can Imagine no possible disagreement. As she puts it, the goal “is to release the creation and sustenance of life into the same realm of decision, struggie, surprise, imagination, and conscious intelligence, as any other difficult, but freely chosen, work.” This collection is not a personal memoir about a poet who has also been it daughter, wife, mother, divorcée and lesbian, but it provides one shattering revelation about her education. She went to a highly selective, competitive all‐girls high school and then to Radcliffe, of which she writes: “I never saw a single woman on a lecture platform, or in front of a class... and never again was Ito experience, from a teacher, the kind of prodding, the insistence that my best could be even better, that I had known in high school. Women students were simply not taken very seriously.” Those women of the same gen“ration who went to Vassar found women professors dominating the faculty: women of such scholarly distinction, of such variety of temperament and personal life, that there was no question of looking for a “role model” needle in a haystack; no need to compare female with male professors; and no women students, only students. There is an important book to be written on the varying imprint of the “Seven Sisters” colleges on distinguished American women of the last halt‐century. For literary starters, Mary McCarthy of Vassar, Adrienne Rich of Radcliffe, and Sylvia Plath of Smith. The generosity with which Adrienne Rich has given herself to feminist causes in the last decade has made this collection out-of-date in one odd way, even though most of its essays were written in the late 1970's. She seems not to have had time to acknowledge and enjoy the accomplishments of the feminist movement. She seems not to know many Young women of 1979, off to their careers in banking or government, intelligently handling their personal lives. But they know Adrienne Rich and what she has written. Thanks are due her from all who raise, teach, Work with, marry or are young women. ■"
Laborites’ Tough Election Battle Is Brought Home to David Owen,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/23/archives/laborites-tough-election-battle-is-brought-home-to-david-owen-a.html,"PLYMOUTH, England, April 22 — The youthful‐looking man stood in the stark stairwell of a housing project, huddled in a parka against the draft, and began his campaign pitch: “Hello, I'm Dr. David Owen and....” The man behind the half‐opened door cut him off, demanding to know his position on abortion, and Dr. Owen replied that he favored the present law, which leaves the decision to the physician. He started to explain his point of view, but after a few moments the man cut him off again. “Well, then, you're it murderer, and I won't support you.” He shut the door. “I don't understand it,” said the Foreign Secretary as he walked away. ‘ How can people refuse to discuss an issue, not These are difficult days for Dr. Owen. Were there no general election, he would be in China now on an official mission. Although he is ohly 41 years old, he has spent the last 28 months parleying with presidents and prime ministers around the world. At home, he has been a fixture on television, and some have spoken of him as a future prime. minister. But for this month at least, his stage has shrunk drastically. All his energy must be poured into his constituency, slice of this old port city in southwestern England called Devonport, containing the naval dockyards, the business area and the spot from where the Mayflower set sail in 1620. A Controversial Figure Dr. Owen is defending the narrowest majority of any member of the Cabinet. He won by only 2,259 votes in October 1974, and in February 1974 he survived by fewer than 1,000. To make matters worse, his opposition to the internal settlement in Rhodesia and what his critics consider a certain arrogant offhandedness in his personality have made him one of the most controversial figures in British politics. A swing from Labor to the Conservatives of 3.2 percent in Devonport would bring Dr. Owen down, and a Gallup Poll published today suggests a national swing of 4.4 percent. As things stand, with only 10 campaign days left, the Foreign Secretary will lose unless he runs well ahead of his party. Rhodesian policy is the centerpiece of the campaign of Dr. Owen's main opponent, Kenneth Hughes, a lugubrious‐looking 57‐year‐old building executive with a • gift for malapropisms. “Owen has demeanored the office of Foreign Secretary,” said Mr. Hughes, the Conservative candidate, in an interview. “His policy on Rhodesia has shown that he is incompetent, and it's unpopular. here. I hear it on thesteps people want to support their kith and kin in Rhodesla. They feel toward them as they do toward Australians and Canadians. Opposes Economic Sanctions Mr Hughes, whose campaign vas plays a recording of “Rule Brittania” as be drives about town, went to Rhodesia October as a guest of the Government of Prime Minister Ian D. Smith. He re. turned with the conviction that Britain should cancel economic sanctions and recognize the multiracial government resuiting from voting that ended yesterday. He has received letters hum all over England otntandng contributions for his fight against the Foreign Secretary. Dr. Owen encounter some of the same sentiment, especially among those with’ relatives in Rhodesia or with past military connections with southern Africa. One woman swept his literature off her table with an angry comment about “people who want to give Africa to the Africans.” But, as the boyishly handsome Foreign Secretary says, “elections aren't won and lost in Britain on foreign‐policy issues.” What he fears most is defections among past supporters who are dissatisfied with Labor's economic record or who fear the power of the big trade unions. He may also suffer from Mr. Hughes's efforts to portray him as an absentee member of Parliament who has never paid enough attention to Plymouth, even before his Cabinet Job took up so much of his time. The Conservatives are playing on affection here for Joan Vickers (now Lady Vickers), who represented Devonport from 1955 to 1971 and devoted much time to solving constituents’ problems. Dr. Owen points in rebuttal to the vast three‐bay drydock in the shipy , the funding for which was approved when he was Navy MInister, and to the new RankToshiba electronics factory, which he helped to bring here. Dr. Owen exercises his considerable charm in low‐key talks to voters. To navy man and his wife whom he encountered loading a chair into their car, he gave a quiet exposition of Labor's past efforts on behalf of the armed forces, hoping to counteract current resentments against a low pay scale. Dr. Owen is told by his local supporters that he is going to win, that Labor defectors are more than matched by former Conservative voters who now plan to vote for him, at least partly because of the publicity he has attracted. He is encouraged but not entirely persuaded, at least not yet. “I believe in polls,” he said, “so I have to think that I'm in trouble. But it's a funny election. Our private polls show that we're doing better in the marginal seats than in the others. You don't hear too much hostile comment, but there is a quiet vote — people who don't proffer their views but are probably worried about trade‐union power.” And if he loses? “I'm not in politics for job security,” he said. “Perhaps I'll find another seat, perhaps not. My training is as a physician, and I could happily go back to that. Or maybe Ill write, or maybe just go to grass fora while.”"
The Screen: A Vignette From India,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/24/archives/the-screen-a-vignette-from-india.html,"""GHATASHRADDHA,"" an Indian film in the Museum of Modern Art's New Directors/New Films series, is set in the early 1940's and proceeds at a pace that might seem contemplative to a snail.A young boy, a Brahmin, is sent by his father to a Vedic school in southern India, where he is befriended by a beautiful widow, the schoolmaster's daughter. She is pregnant. The boy tries to help conceal her condition from the other students and the town busy-body. Finally, her secret is discovered and she undergoes an abortion, and the ritual of the title, an excommunication. She becomes an untouchable, the school closes down, and the boy is returned to his aristocratic family.All this is of considerably more anthropological than cinematic interest. The director, a 27-year-old Indian film school graduate named Girish Kasaravalli, offers considerable solemnity but few surprises. He uses outstandingly beautiful actors to play his admirable characters, and squat, shifty-eyed players for his villains. His command of the camera is at times barely rudimentary, and there is little visual variety to the film. Occasionally, the customs and the countryside on view are captured with admirable delicacy.But what sort of audience can a film like this expect to attract? The New Directors series is undeniably performing a worthy function in exhibiting a first film that would perhaps not be shown here otherwise, a film that could look a good deal better with hindsight some day.But for the time being, students of Indian cinema have at their disposal the masterpieces of Satyajit Ray, which turn up on the art-house circuit with great frequency, and the Bombay Cinema, which shows a wide spectrum of Indian commercial movies. ""Ghatashraddha"" demonstrates neither the artistry of the first nor the vitality of the second.

"As Population Nears a Billion, China Stresses Curbs",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/24/archives/as-population-nears-a-billion-china-stresses-curbs-several.html,"WUXI, China, April 18 — A large pink chart on the wall of the clinic of the Xihung production brigade near this industrial city advertises how each local official is complying with what may be China's most important campaign, birth control. Americans would be embarrassed to have their neighbors know what method of birth control, if any, they are using. But here public scrutiny is used as weapon. Twenty‐seven of the brigade's 29 officials are men and the chart names 10 who have had vasectomies. Fourteen other officials or their wives are using birth‐control pills or the intrauterine device. Two of the remaining five are married but are not practicing family planning and the three others are too young to marry under China's strict policy of delaying wedlock until the late 20's. The chart gives the year in which they may get married. Several Approaches Are Tried The Xihung brigade's chart is only one of a variety of approaches China is using to cut its birth rate as its population rapidly nears one billion. Since the Communists came to power in 1949, there have been two other major attempts at birth control. But in the past year, in an effort to reduce the rate of population growth to 1 percent by 1980, Peking has started a far more organized and drastic program. The importance of the new effort is suggested by a recent disclosure: Despite the regime's emormous investment in agriculture, the average amount of grain distributed to each person in China has decreased since 1957 as the population has grown by 300 million. One of the most radical innovations, providing cash subsidies and other incentives to parents who have only one child, is being tried in Sichuan Province, which with 90 million people is more populous than all but seven countries in the world. Last month Sichuan announced it would offer, on a trial basis, a bonus of five yuan, or $3.25, a month to families who pledge to have no more than one child. That is equivalent to about 10 percent of an average worker's monthly income. More Grain for Single Child The families would also be eligible for the same amount of housing as a family of four and their child would receive preferential treatment in admission to school and in job assignment. To try to overcome the age‐old preference of Chinese peasants for large families and male offspring, which is rooted in the economics of farming, single children of rural families will count as 1.5 persons in the award of private plots and will receive an extra grain ration. A similiar experiment is being tried in Guangdong Province in what may be the forerunner of a new national policy of glorifying the one‐child family. Yunnan Province in the southwest hinted recently that it would go a step further and impose economic penalties on couples that have more than two chil1 dren, though it did not specify what they would be. Guizhou Province, also in the southwest, has apparently begun setting quotas of people to be sterilized each year, according to a local broadcast. The size of China's population has long been hotly debated among specialists. Peking itself sometimes refers to 800 million people, sometimes to 900 million. Foreign estimates generally range from 870 million to 950 million, but one demographer, John S. Aird, of the United States Census Bureau, has calculated that China broke the one billion mark on May Day in 1978. China's birth rate is also not known. Foreign specialists put the rate of population growth last year at about 1.5 percent, with lower levels in the cities, where the Government exerts greater control, than in the countryside. The Chinese press says that the rate of increase is already below the target of 1 percent a year in Shanghai, Peking and Tianjin, the three largest cities, and in eight provinces, or more than a third of the country. Province Reports Birth Rate UP But Henan Province on the north China plain, with a population of 70 million, recently revealed that its birth rate rose in both 1977 and 1978 and is continuing upward this year. In one county in Guangdong, near Hong Kong, five officials have had five or more children since 1973, with the wife of one giving birth to seven children in that time, a bad example to peas. ants in the area, a broadcast reported. The use of publicly kept birth control charts, like that in the brigade in Wuxi, 70 miles northwest of Shanghai on the Grand Canal, is also common in many factories. Women's groups in the factories often decide which family will be allowed to have a baby each year under their unit's birth quota and monitor the menstrual cycles of the female employees to check compliance. Abortions, like other birth control devices in China, are largely free and given on request. At the Logang commune hospital outside Canton, the doctor reported that she performs five to 10 abortions a day, tar more than the number of births at the hospital. The operation, carried out in a small bare room equipped only with a table, lasts about half an hour and is done without anesthetic. Unless there are complications, the women are expected to return to work in the fields the same day. China has reportedly made several breakthroughs in birth control research, developing a new male contraceptive pill, based on a cottonseed derivative, gossypo1, and a “visiting” pill for use when a man returns home on leave."
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/25/archives/letters-the-long-hard-road-to-fair-realty-taxation.html,"To the Editor: Your April 8 editorial advocating differential taxation for various property types in New York failed to address several difficult questions which must be faced in dealing with the issue of real propertY taxation. You thus reduced the complex debate regarding the future of the state's property tax to an oversimplified discussion of homeowners versus businesses. While there is little doubt that an illegal de facto “system” of classified assessments benefiting homeowners has existed for several generations in New York City, all available evidence indicates there are appalling assessment inequities within the residential class. These inequities must be corrected. They are neither morally nor legally defensible. Assuming that a classified system could be developed that would prevent an increase in the total tax burden now borne by the residential class in the city, the elimination of these inequities among homeowners would result in substantial tax increases for many householders whose property is now underassessed in comparison with their neighbors'. The Times claims that any tax increases for homeowners are not “politically practical.” Yet such tax increases (and decreases) are unavoidable if we are to make that owners of homes of equal value are paying equal tax bills. Barring special dispensations for the elderly and the poor, is any other “system” justifiable? The problem of grossly inequitable assessments among homeowners is not unique to New York City. A recent study by the State Board of Equalization and Assessment of the 31 municipalities which converted to full‐value assessments in 1978 shows that the majority of individual homeowners’ tax increases resulted from tax reductions not for businesses but for individual homeowners who had been relatively overassessed. What is more, you have completely ignored existing assessment practices in other New York municipalities. With the exception of the 128 localities which have converted to full‐value assessments,.there are literally as many “assessing systems” as there are assessing jurisdictions. Some (like New York City) favor homeowners; some favor farmers and owners of vacant land; some favor businesses; some favor industrial property owners. In many it is the homeowners who are being “overtaxed.” Indeed, in roughly a third of the 31 municipalities which converted last year homeowners as a class experienced a. net decrease in their share of the total tax burden. The issue that Albany policy makers must confront is that recent Federal court decisions indicate that any scheme of classified or differential taxation must be uniform statewide. The Times's position assumes that a system designed to protect homeowners in New York City will have the same effects in other parts of the state. Such is simply not the case. A New York City based classified system would cause disruption aud havoc in municipal finances throughout the state. Unfortunately, there are no simple solutions — such as those proposed by your editorial — to the difficult problems inherent in correcting the intolerable inequities that have resulted from decades of neglecting the property tax. The Temporary State Commission on the Real Property Tax, whose recommendations were cast aside by The Times as “failing to meet the political challenge of protecting most homeowners from tax increases,” recognized these complexities and suggested means by which the state can achieve a compassionate and legally defensible property tax system. DAVID GASKELL Executive Director New York State Board of Equalization and Assessment Albany, April 10.1979 Prisoners' ‘Protectors’ To the Editor: The ruling of the New York State Court of Appeals which forbids the firing of a person serving as a prison guard who is a member of the Ku Klux Klan was a deadly blow against blacks, Hispanics and Indians. Your April 13 editorial in favor of the decision on the ground of the right of free association is even more discomforting. The Klan has a well‐known and fully demonstrated hatred of blacks and nonwhites in general. It is the most racist organization in the nation. It has demonstrated its hatred in countless thousands of incidents of murders, hangings, burnings, mutilations and beatings of blacks. To uphold its members’ right to be prison guards over nonwhites is like upholding the right of a rattlesnake to be placed in a cage with a human being. Only the rights of the rattlesnake are considered. And only if he strikes is action to be taken against him. This is small comfort for those blacks forced to submit to the tender mercies of either the rattlesnake or the Klan. It is a Klan mentality that protects the right of Klansmen to “protect” blacks already condemned by a society the Klan considers superior to all others. The State Department of Corrections was altogether right in not allowing a known Klansman to be a “protector” of prisoners who are the targets of Klan hatred. The Court of Appeals rendered a decision that is racist to the core. For the sake of the prisoners, hope it will be appealed. (Rev.) C. HERBERT OLIVER Brooklyn, April 13, 1979 Who Killed the Rhodesian Missionaries? To the Editor: The fact that Ian Smith's commandos were dressed in the uniforms of Zambian soldiers in their raid on Lusaka and in the uniforms of the Botswana Defense Force in their raid on Francistown on Good Friday should lend credence to the claim of the indigenous churches that missionaries have been killed, not by the guerrilla forces of Nkome and Mugabe, but by that unit of the Rhodesian army, the Selous Scouts, whose specialty is deceitful masquerading. I have visited the refugee camp in Francistown, Botswana, which is maintained by the Lutheran World Federation and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. It is not a military camp but a place of refuge for those who have found the oppression in Rhodesia, intolerable. When I spoke with young people in the camp, I heard stories of intimidation, beatings and killings in the village by these units of Smith's army. Some of the children bore the marks on their bodies. Many of the fathers of these children (I say “children” because their ages were between 10 and 16) were in prison, were dead or had been forcibly conscripted into the Rhodesian The young people with whom I spoke had grown up in mission schools and were deeply pietistic. They wanted to pray and read from the Bible and sing some hymns, all of which we did together. I found no one who wished to carry a gun (“We are all against violence,” one told me), but neither did I find anyone who thought that there was an alternative for ending the oppression. Many of those with whom I spoke have since moved on to camps in Zambia, either to train for fighting in the army of the Patriotic Front or simply to exist as refugees. My information is that many from the group, both military and refugee, have been killed in Zambian camps by the air force of Ian Smith. Although their mother tongue is Shona, they were able to articulate their convictions clearly in their second language, English. They could not for a moment believe that a member of the Patriotic Front would kill a missionary. They considered the missionaries (except for those of the Dutch Reformed Church) to be their friends in the struggle. No Dutch Reformed missionaries have been killed. They all were prepared to talk in detail about the masquerading tricks of the Selous Scouts. They all branded the “internal settlement” a hoax, an elaborate facade to keep the white minority in power under the guise of “democracy.” The one question they asked repeatedly was why the United States and other Western countries insisted on lending support to 3 percent of the population and refusing support to the black majority. I confess that I could give them no adequate answer. PAUL A. WEE General Secretary Lutheran World Ministries New York, April 16, 1979 Winners’ Prep To the Editor: I hope that all the high school seniors who were depressed by their inability to gain admission to Ivy League colleges noticed the collegiate backgrounds of this year's Pulitzer Prize winners. The New York Times listed 12 such backgrounds, and not one was from the Ivy League [news article April 17]. This seems to suggest that where a student goes to college is not half so important as what he (or she) does when he gets to his college. No college can deny a good education to students with curiosity and resolution. EUGENE S. WILSON Dean of Admission Emeritus Amherst College Amherst, Mass., April 18, 1979 ‘Irresponsible’ Blows Against SALT II To the Editor: If the United States Senate rejects the new Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty, it will be due in large part to the irresponsible comments of Americans in and out of government who should know better. Unfortunately, the treaty is being ripped to shreds before it has a chance to be completed. Unlike many Americans, I trust President Carter to negotiate a SALT II treaty that will enhance our nation's security and reduce the unreasonably high levels of nuclear armaments. I am convinced that our President could never affix his signature to any treaty that would jeopardize the security of the American people. Extreme statements to the contrary are not only misguided, they are downright dangerous. Let us allow our senators to debate the treaty after the negotiating process has ended, not before. Public and private citizens who cannot respect this diplomatic process will force all of us to suffer the conseauences of their actions. PHILIP A. HILTON Menands, N.Y., April 13, 1979 Clean, Safe and Available Hydropower To the Editor: I received an invitation the other day to attend a conference to promote the development of small‐scale hydropower in New York State. The meeting is sponsored by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority and will be held in Albany on April 26. Were it not for the climate generated by the recent fiats from OPEC and magnified by the near‐disaster in Harrisburg, this event would hardly make a ripple in the day's news. The choice between ever‐higher prices and a radioactive cloud has driven most of us to ask again, Is there an alternative? The answer is yes. At the request of the Legislature, the authority commissioned a survey of developable sites throughout the state. It found in excess of 1,700 that have economic potential. They range in output capability from 50,000 to 1.5 million watts. Their combined power could be equal to three nuclear power plants. Surprisingly, some 1,100 come complete with dams. Water power is clean, safe and renewable. The industrial revolution was powered by it. The manufacturing successes of the 18th and 19th centuries here in the Northeast were the result of it. The technology is well known, and equipment is readily available. Thousands upon thousands of excellent sites are in existence throughout the energy‐vulnerable Mid‐Atlantic states and New England. They could augment the energy requirements of county or municipal building complexes, power street lighting, run pumps for water supply or be used by a group of homeowners. And most important, after the energy is extracted from this source you can still fish in it, swim in it and drink it. The legislatures of these states should have heard the cries for action, and be encouraged to do away with the deed restrictions imposed by the power monopolies at the turn of The century, to allow the formation of energy cooperatives and to ease environmental roadblocks. The money to build these installations has already been budgeted in the form of energy bills to be payed by towns, individuals and industries. The projects can even be modest, i.e. the generator, regulator, turbine and plumbing for a 10‐kilowatt plant can be had for less than $15,000. So there is an alternative that is clean and safe. ROBERT J. HEROLD Florham Park, N.J., April 13, 1979 Public‐Funding Question To the Editor: If the selective apportionment of public money to rich school districts is wrong because it compels some of the poor to pay for something they will not use, why is it not wrong selectively to apportion public funds for abortions, which compels some of the poor to pay for somethine they will not use?

Pregnancy Concern Found Near Nuclear Accident Site,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/26/archives/pregnancy-concern-found-near-nuclear-accident-site-number-of-tests.html,"MIDDLETOWN, Pa., April 25 — Private and state medical authorities appear to have allayed the fears of pregnant women here to the extent that there has been no rush for abortions as a result of the Three Mile Island nuclear accident last month. However, one of the two abortion clinics in the area reports a dramatic rise in the number of women seeking pregnancy tests, suggesting a significant level of concern among women who may have conceived recently. “We haven't had any woman make an appointment for an abortion expressly because of radiation exposure,” said Holly Davenport, director of Hillcrest Clinic in Harrisburg. She said that in the first few days of the crisis her office received a “phenomenal” number of telephohe calls but that after the Pennsylvania Department of Health and private physicians publicly advised against abortions, the calls dropped off. Number of Tests Rises However, the number of pregnancy tests conducted by the clinic has risen to 17 to 25 a day from 10 to 12 a day. Mrs. Davenport sees this as a gauge of anxiety in the community but adds that. so far as she knows, the nuclear accident probably affected only “some women on the fence ‐women who were having trouble deciding on abortion. “The T.M.I. accident may have swayed them,” she said. “It was psychological, a determination not based on fact. It assuaged their conscience.” Patricia Greenawald, co‐director of Harrisburg Reproductive Health, the other abortion clinic in this vicinity, also said that she knew of no abortion directly related to the accident. Nor did either, woman know of any physician who had recommended abortion as a result of exposure. Mrs. Greenawald did not have figures on the number of pregnancy tests being made at her clinic. Deep Anger Voiced Here in Middletown, pregnant women who were hastily evacuated last month express deep anger over the traumatic developments but no thoughts at all on terminating their pregnancies. “There was an article in The Harrisburg Patriot that said don't jump the gun on this thing,” said Audrey Dickson, who is four months pregnant. “I have not considered an abortion. My doctor said it was not necessary.” Mrs. Dickson, who has a 12‐year‐old son, Tim, said that she and her friends carried “an awful lot of hostility” because of the danger and the inconvenience. “I was 16 miles away from here at the Treadway Inn,” she said. “The halls were full of us. There were pregnant women everywhere. You know what motel room is like. Two double beds and television. That's it. It rained. There was nothing for the children to do. “A hostess in the restaurant asked me how we were doing. I said you just block out tomorrow and cope with now. When we finally got home, I said, ‘Tim, I love you very much, but go play as long as you want. I'm sick of the sight of you.'’ A neighbor of Mrs. Dickson's, Marian Shuttlesworth, who is “due any day” with her second child, said that she and her husband were considering leaving Middletown for good. “It's a difficult time,” she said, “because when you get this far along you feel very homebound.” Mrs. Shuttlesworth said that she and “a lot more people still don't feel like we are getting enough information.” “We are still using bottled water and powdered milk,” she said, “and everyone is questioning planting a garden.” The New York Times/Keith Meyers Audrey Dickson and her son, Tim, in their Middletown, Pa., home.

Prenatal Test Detects Hemophilia,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/27/archives/prenatal-test-detects-hemophilia-even-chance-for-normality.html,"BOSTON, April 26 (AP) — Doctors say that for the first time they are able to tell before birth whether a baby will have hemophilia, the inherited bleeding disorder that once plagued the royalty of Europe. Using a needle to draw fluid from the fetus, the researchers say, they can find out whether the unborn's blood contains the necessary protein that allows it to clot. People who have severe hemophili bleed uncontrollably. Although the disc ease affects only boys, it is passed on to them by their mothers. One male in 6,500 has it. Even Chance for Normality Until now, women who suspected they carried the genetic trait for this disease often avoided having children. Another alternative was to have an abortion if they learned through amniocentesis, another prenatal test, that the fetus was male. However, there is a 50‐50 chance that boys conctivat7emthese women will be normal. The until now has been determining ore birth which boys are healthy and which are bleeders. The new test was developed by doctors at the medical schools at Yale, the University of Connecticut and Case Western Reserve. Their study was published today in The New England Journal of Medicine. “This test would be done after determining that the baby was in fact male by amniocentesis,” Dr. Bernard G. Forget, one of the Yale researchers, said in an interview. “Given a male infant, this technology would allow one to determine whether it is in the 50 percent that does have the disease.” In the new procedure, doctors use letoscope, an instrument developed by two members of the research team, to draw fetal blood from the placenta. Then they analyze it to determine whether it has the ingredient necessary for clotting. In their study, the doctors tested the new method on the male fetuses of six warren who were in the middle trimester of pregnancy. All their families had cases of severe hemphilia. Based on the test, the doctors determined that three of the fetuses were normal and three would have the bleeding disease. As a result, the mothers of the three defective fetuses had abortions."
Abortion a Big Issue in French Vote for Europe Assembly,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/27/archives/abortion-a-big-issue-in-french-vote-for-europe-assembly-silent-on.html,"PARIS, April 26 — Abortion and population are becoming major political issues in France once again, injected into the election campaign for the Assembly of the European Community despite their irrelevance to the choice of its representatives. The latest development was a white book published this week by the bishops of France titled “Let Live ‐The Catholic Church and Abortion.” It not only denounces abortion as an “act of death, a great error, an evil for society,” but also criticizes what it terms “moral regression” in France and says that “the will to live seems to have been tragically lost in many countries.” Supporters of the 1975 law permitting abortion in France for the first time asserted that the declaration had more to do with the bitter infighting that has erupted here over the European election in June than with the debate due in Parliament on the renewal of the law this fall. The French church was also emboldened by Pope JOhn Paul's antiabortion statements, the critics asserted. The Minister of Health, Simone Veil, whose skill and elguided the measure to approval, pointed out that the bishops’ declaration did not specifically call for repeal or amendment and constituted, as she put it, only “a basis for reflection.” Silent on Gbgard's Position Mrs. Veil is leading the list of Government‐backed candidates for the European Assembly; since that guarantees her election, it means she will no longer be in the Cabinet this fall. Her position favoring liberalized abortion has not changed, she said, but in a radio inter‐. view she avoided a direct, answer to a question whether President Valery Giscard d'Estaing had shifted. The legalization of abortion under certain conditions was one of the two major reforms won by Mr. Giscard d'Estaing after his campaign promise of sweeping changes for France, the other being the vote for 18‐year‐olds. However, when he was asked about renewal of the law in a recent interview, he said only that it was up to Parliament and expressed no personal support, as he did vigorously in the initial debate. The law must be renewed by early next year or it will expire, leaving in effect the old code forbidding abortion and imposing stiff criminal penalties on women who have them as well as on those who counsel, assist or perform them. The mounting arguments are directed at the way the law has been applied, the idea of legalized abortion itself and the role of abortion in the stagnation of population growth. While the President and Mrs. Veil have insisted that there is no relation between the declining birth rate and legal abortion, former Prime Minister Michel Debre. whO has been issuing alarmed statements for several years about the danger of depopulation, insists that there is a direct connection. The birth rate in France, stable for the last few years, is 1.84 children per woman of childbearing age, with 2.1 needed for zero population growth, The number of marriages continues to drop, however, with 342,000 last year, against 355,000 In 1977 and 416,500 in 1972. The statistics have led some to predict that by the year 2030 there will be only 14 million people, although more sober projeCtions are that the population will increase by three million to five million by the year 2050 because of a lower death rate. The official population figure on Jan. 1 was 53,373,000, an increase of 190,000 over the previous year. The falling birth rate is even more accentuated in much of the European Community, with West Germany having the lowest at 1.44, far below the level of stability. Projections show a drop from a population of 61 million today to only 38 million in 2050. The dramatic popllationloss in France during World War I led it to institute a series of family‐support laws that are still in effect. Both the church and those such as Mr. Debre who fear population decline for political, national and economic reasons have proclaimed these laws inadequate. Mr. Debre argues primarily in terms of France's status as a power. Others point out that fewer births will mean an aging population with too few active workers to support all the pensioners. The arguments contradict the parallel debate about too few jobs and too many workers and ecologists’ demands for less industrial development and more services. Highly Politicized Issues Meanwhile, the demography and abortion issues, whether rightly or wrongly linked, have become highly politicized. Feminists have maintained that the abortion law still includes serious constraints and has been applied haphazardly, with grave injustice. A conscience clause allows doctors to refuse to perform abortions, a right that Mrs. Veil has described as fundamental and necessary but which has worked, in practice, to make legal abortion almost impossible in many parts of the country and very difficult in others. The tight hierarchy maintained by the medical profession allows senior doctors who are against abortion to impose their views on their juniors. Official figures show that 139,700 abortions were performed in 1976 and 151,000 in 1977, two‐thirds in public hospitals and a third in private clinics, which are usually much more expensive. But these figures represent only official records; feminist groups estimate that the real figure is 300,000 to 950,000. There were 735,000 births and 545,000 deaths last year. The law makes abortion legal only until the 10th week of pregnancy. Many women have reported that they were subject to administrative and medical delays that they considered subterfuges to deny their right to legal operations. The law also excludes foreigners and minors without formal consent and excludes payment from otherwise generous health care under social security. The feminist groups want these clauses liberalized, but the political atmosphere is such that they are likely to have a difficult time just getting the law extended.

"Three Generations of Peabody Women, as a Film Portrays Them",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/28/archives/three-generations-of-peabody-women-as-a-film-portrays-them-suddenly.html,"WASHINGTON, April 27 — It was not your usual Washington party with talk of the strategic arms treaty, inflation and politics, for the conversation focused on three women and a film recently made about them. The Georgetown town house of Barbara and Endicott Peabody was jammed Wednesday night with about 200 friends who had attended an earlier private screening at the Corcoran Gallery of a 58‐minute documentary called “The Female Line,” a look at three generations of the Peabody family through its women. They are 87‐year‐old Mary Parkman Peabody, the Boston activist who at the age of 72 was arrested and jailed during civil rights demonstrations in St. Augustine, Fla.; her daughter, Marietta Tree, a New York socialite and businesswoman who was this country's first woman to serve as chief delegate of the United States at the United Nations; and Mrs. Tree's daughter, the Pulitzer Prize‐winning author Frances Fitzgerald. Mrs. Peabody was the only one of the three to show up in Washington for the party at the home of her son, the former Governor of Massachusetts. And she sat — her eyes sparkling, a smile never leaving her indomitable face on a flowered sofa in the small den, surrounded by admirers and family and a fleet of photographers. ‘Suddenly It Was Being Done’ No one nad actually ever asked her to do the film, which was produced by a daughter‐in‐law, Pamela Peabody, she explained, “but ‘suddenly it was just being done.” “The surprising thing was that I learned so much about my granddaughter in watching it — I had no idea she even thought about some of those things,” she said. The film uses a series of talking heads of each woman discussing a variety of subjects, from marriage and abortion to politics and foreign policy in the Middle East. The three generations’ diverging views are expressed, for example, in a discussion of sex: Mrs. Peabody: “Too bad nowadays there is so loose a pattern of sex life so that apparently people can live together without being married and they think that's working out well.” Mrs. Tree: “Promiscuity must be damaging to the spirit … Perhaps sex without love really is a bore..” Miss Fitzgerald: “I think that the kids who grew up in the 60's have a much better attitude toward sex than people of my generation. There's none of this grasping aspect about it. Sex isn't looked upon as a conquest of the woman by the, man.” The film cuts from Marietta Tree wafting about in a white caftan in her pink and green, porcelain‐filled New York apartment, to Mrs. Peabody shelling green beans on the porch of her New England home, to Frankie Fitzgerald in tailored pants and shirt in an empty schoolroom and on a wooded trail near her Maine cottage. two reclusive members of Jacqueline Onassis's father's family. “I think there might be a limited audience for it,” he said. “It might do well on public television or in one of the art‐film theaters.” Jacqueline Onassis visited Mt. Desert Island, Me., during the period a portion of the film was being made and became interested in the project. As a result, Mrs. Onassis is editing a book at Doubleday, which Robin Hardy, who wrote and directed the film, is writing, about the three generations of Peabody women. It will incorporate photographs that were made during the filming. Charles Lord, headmaster of St. Timothy's, a girl's school in Baltimore, said that in looking at the film from the perspective of a man involved in the education of young women, he thought it “marvelously educational.” But most guests agreed with Jack Schafer, a Washington lawyer, who commented, “It's brutal on Marietta I understand she wants it cut.” Asked if she felt the film was unfair to her daughter, Mrs. Peabody looked troubled and replied, “It never occurred to me that it was, but she thinks so. They put her in that limousine and she doesn't even have a car of her own ‐ money isn't really the thing that runs Marietta, and I am sorry if people took that amiss.” Mrs. Tree was asked in a telephone interview what she thought of the film which, she said, she had seen in New York at a private viewing last fall. Mrs. Tree is now a partner in the international city planning firm of Llewelyn‐Davies Associates and a board member of Pan American World Airways, CBS and United States Trust Company. “It's impossible to tell, it's so subjective and I'd rather not comment,” she said. There was a silence and she added with a small laugh, “It's risk taking.” She had cooperated, she said, “because my sister‐in‐law wanted to be a television producer, and so we decided to do it because we are fond of her. But it needs some cutting, don't you think? Perhaps that will improve it.” Pamela Peabody, who is married to Mrs. Tree's brother, the Washington businessman Malcolm Peabody, produced the film. Arrangements for commercial showings have not yet been completed. ‘Made Her Proud’ Asked what the family thought of the film, Pamela Peabody replied, “one of my nieces cried when she saw it, she said it made her very proud.” But she admitted, “Frankie is extremely protective of her mother and she is upset. She was angry because the film doesn't point up that there were black dinner guests in the Barbados scene which pans to the black butler.” “Pam didn't want me to make the film a hymn of praise to her family,” interjected Mr. Hardy. “She wanted to show what these extraordinary women are like — they are all talking liberal politics and yet they talk from such different perspectives.” Miss Fitzgerald, reached by phone in Boston and asked how she liked being a film star, replied, “I hate it.” “You see,” she explained, “I'm a reporter, and I'm not used to being on the other side of the story — it was hard to do. It wasn't cinema verite — it was a real movie with a number of scenes shot over and over — I just don't think we are interesting enough.” And was the film unfair to her mother? “Yes,” was the one‐word reply.

Bill Seeks To Cut Sexual Harassment of Employees,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/29/archives/bill-seeks-to-cut-sexual-harassment-of-employees-small-claims-court.html,"ALBANY, April 27 — The State Senate Minority Task Force on Women's Issues proposed legislation this week that would permit workers to collect unemployment compensation if they could demonstrate that they had quit their jobs because of sexual or verbal harassment. The bill would also cover workers who had left their jobs because of physical or verbal harassment based on race, creed, color, disability or national origin. The proposal was part of a package of 22 pieces of legislation that also included an 80‐page bill recodifying the entire corpus of state law to replace references to “man” or “men” with words such as “human,” “persons” or “people.” The sponsors of the unemployment measure hope that the possibility of disclosure by workers seeking unemployment benefits would discourage sexual harassment by employers. Other bills — in the package would require minors to be informed of “procedures, consequences and alternatives regarding abortion” and require informed consent prior to an abortion, to protect an indidual's right to privacy in.filing medical claims and to bar sex discrimination in areas ranging from insurance to prisons to school athletic programs. The future of the package was uncer- tain, though sponsors of the bills said they believed that at least some of them had chance of being enacted into law. A top Senate Republican aide said he believed that the unemployment compensation bill might have a chance “as long as there are safeguards.” In its first week back in session after two‐week recess, the Legislature took the following other actions: Small Claims Court The Assembly gave final passage to two bills to expand the rights of claimants in Small Claims Court. One would prohibit companies sued in the court from countersuing by an amount that would force the case out of Small Claims and into a higher court. The other would require a night session of Small Claims Court at least once a week. The Senate, which had approVed the two bills, also approved a proposal that would make it possible for a claimant to collect from a defendant even when the name of his corporation was technically incorrect in court papers. Businesses often use legal names that are different from the names they use publicly. Utility Bills The Assembly approved a variety of measures that supporters said would expand the rights of consumers involving utility companies. But one major bill the “lifeline” proposal — was pulled back because of fears on the part of some As- sembly members that its effect would be too far‐reaching. The lifeline bill would have limited the cost of the first 200 kilowatt hours used by residential customers each month. This would have sharply cut the electricity bill of the average residential homeowner. But since the bill allowed the utilities to make up these losses elsewhere, it could have resulted in substantial rate increases for other, classes of customers. Legislative aides said the bill might be approved later this year in a less farreaching form — possibly by having it apply only to the elderly. Other utility measures approved included bills stopping utilities from including the cost of advertising and promotion in their rate structure and requiring com- petitive bidding on contracts of more than $100,000. Naval Maneuvers The Assembly spent two hours debating a resolution petitioning the Federal Government to stop naval maneuvers including practice shelling — on the Island of Vieques off Purto Rico. But in the middle of the roll‐call vote on the resolution, its sponsors withdrew it, fearing it would be defeated. They said they would amend the resolution to eliminate sharp language that some Assemblymen found objectionable, and then bring it back to the floor."
Rate of Illegal Abortions Placed At 20 Million a Year Worldwide,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/30/archives/rate-of-illegal-abortions-placed-at-20-million-a-year-worldwide.html,"WASHINGTON, April 29 (Reuters) —An estimated 20 million illegal abortions are performed in the world each year and are a leading cause of death among women of child‐bearing age, a study issued today said The repok by the the Population Crisis Committee also said that another 20 million abortion were self‐induced annually and that the number was growing. The committee, which monitors international population and family planning programs, said that it was impossible to estimate the number of deaths from abortion, partly because of poor mortality registration procedures in many developing countries. The Center for Disease Control in Atlanta has estimated that for every 100,000 illegal abortions performed annually in the United States there are 50 to 150 deaths. Increase Is Expected The rate in developing countries has been estimated to be 100 to 1,500 deaths in every 100,000 cases. The population committee, a private organization, reported that the incidence of abortion was expected to rise as a result of wider preference for smaller families, lack of alternative family planning services and an increase in the number of women of child‐bearing age. Illegal abortion is especially common in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, where laws are restrictive and family planning services are scarce, according to the analysis. More than half of all pregnancies in Austria, Italy, Japan, Portugal, the Soviet Union and Uruguay, where the most effective contraceptive methods are generally unavailable, are thought to end in abortion, the report said. Restrictive laws do not appear to deter women from seeking abortion, the report said, adding that, of the 10 countries thatprohibit abortion under any circum1 stance, seven recorded more than one abortion for every five live births. Differences In Age Cited More than 60 countries, mainly Asian, European and North American, representing three quarters of the world's population, permit abortion. Abortion is permitted only under lifethreatening circumstances in 30 countries, the report said. Outside the United States and Europe, women obtaining abortions tend to be in their 30's or older, married and close to or past their desired family size, the report found. In contrast, it said, women having abortions in the United States and in most western European countries are normally those in their 20's or younger and often seek to postpone a first birth or avoid an illegitimate one. The committee said that the widespread use of abortion had a more immediate impact on birth rates than any other single factor. However, it noted that in the past decade abortion declined from the most common method of birth control to the third most common, behind voluntary sterilization, with 80 million users, and oral contraceptives, with 55 million users."
"For Pro‐Abortion Group, an ‘Aggressive New Campaign’",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/01/archives/for-proabortion-group-an-aggressive-new-campaign-i-hear-from-the.html,"WASHINGTON, April 30 — As hundreds of women sporting big yellow “Choice” buttons streamed through the halls of Congressional office buildings today, the National Abortion Rights Action League wound up a fourday national convention by lobbying legislators anti filing six complaints with the Federal Election Commission, alleging violations of Federal election laws by a number of anti‐abortion groups. The conference, which drew more than 700 pro‐abortion representatives from around the country to celebrate the organization's 10th anniversary, marked the beginning of “an aggressive new campaign to let legislators know that compulsory pregnancy is not the will of the people,” said Karen Mulhauser, executive director of the organization. ‘I Hear From the Other Side’ Several Congressmen who addressed the convention this morning at its final breakfast said such a campaign is necessary to counteract the vigorous efforts of anti‐abortion groups. “I almost never hear from this side,” said Representative Michael Barnes, Democrat of Maryland. “But I hear from the other side all the time— every day. I know that is not because there are more of them than there are of us, but they are organized, active and working.” Accordingly, the organization is now beginning a major effort, directed toward the 1980 campaigns, which will range from intensive lobbying and public information drives to bumper stickers like the current one that reads: “I am Pro‐Choice—and I vote.” Such votes will be vital in neutralizing the impact of anti‐abortion activists, Senator Robert W. Packwood, Republican of Oregon, told the group's members. “Abortion ought to be the No. I issue for women all over the country in 1980,” he maintained. ‘Hit List’ Targets Senator Packwood, a longtime advocate of women's right to abortion, said that he and his colleague, Senator Birch Bayh, Democrat of Indiana, are among the leading targets of an antiabortion “hit list” aimed at defeating pro‐abortion legislators. “I'm going to beat the bejabbers out of that group in 1980, with your help,” declared Senator Packwood In addition to supporting proabor tion candidates, the abortion rights organization will start combating its opponents on the abortion issue with such other strategies as filing the complaints with the Federal Election Cornmission. “We've been very reactive in the past,” explained Jackie Dumont, chairman of Freedom of Choice‐Ohio, a statewide coalition of pro‐abortion groups. “The new tactic is to be more aggressive. We're doing a lot more grass‐roots organizing, and we're going to be a lot more political.” The membership of the National Abortion Rights Action League has grown from 8,500 to over 65,000 in the last two years, according to Mrs. Mulhauser, who announced the filing of the complaints against anti‐abortion groups with the election commission at a final news conference. The complaints allege violations of Federal election laws in 1978 by two national anti‐abortion groups, the Life Amendment Political Action Committee and the National Right to Life Committee, and also by four state organizations in South Dakota, Massachusetts, Indiana and New Mexico. NARAL has accused the life amendment group of illegally soliciting funds from the general public even though, they say, it is connected with the National Right to Life Committee; Federal election laws state that an affiliated organization may only solicit contributions from its parent organization's membership, and not from the general public. Paul Brown, director of Life Amendment Political Action Committee, termed the complaint “nonsense,” and denied that his group was in any way affiliated with N.R.L.C. Another charge is that the National Right to Life Committee's Voter Identification Project constitutes unlawful corporate contributions to anti‐abortion candidates, and NARAL is requesting that the election commission prohibit the project. In response to the charges, Ann McDonnell, executive vice president of the right‐to‐life organization, said, “N.R.L.C. welcomes the investigation. We have not broken the law. NARAL's reaction to our successes indicates the desperate situation the anti‐life forces find themselves in today.” Ask for Investigation The individual state suits allege unreported and illegal election activity on the part of groups in each of the four states. Penalties for all the alleged violations, if substantiated, could total in excess of $100,000, according to the pro‐abortion group, and if the violations were found to be “knowing and willful,” the fines could be double that amount. “What we're claiming is the tip of the iceberg,” added Miss Dumont. “We have information that this is happening in other states, and we're asking the election commission to investigate how extensive it is.” Nevertheless, said Mrs. Mulhauser, despite the well‐organized efforts of anti‐abortionists, “There has been enormous success since NARAL was founded 10 years ago,” she said. “Its name at the time was the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws, since abortion was illegal in most states then. “Back then,” she continued, “it was estimated there were 1,200,000 illegal abortions each year; abortion was the third largest crime in the country. In 1978 there were an estimated 1,300,000 abortions. So the issue is not whether or not there will be abortions, but whether or not they are legal, where and how they are performed, and who performs them.” According to Mrs. Mulhauser, the latest figures from a Harris poll in March show that 60 percent of Americans now support the Supreme Court decision on abortion, up from 53 percent in 1977. “So we are confident that as the issue gets a fuller airing, even lore people are acknowledging their upport for legal abortions,” she said. “But we're doing this with a sense of urgency about the 1980 elections,” she continued, “because some politicians have been persuaded by the antiabortionists that they are strong enough to make a difference in their campaigns.”"
The Doctor's World,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/01/archives/the-doctors-world-the-doctors-world.html,"DURING the next few weeks, in a tradition dating to ancient Greece and in a climate of renewed concern about ethics, thousands of America's newest physicians will repeat the Oath of Hippocrates at medical school graduation ceremonies. In July, when these physicians start their internships, they will begin regularly violating the Hippocratic Oath and the Precepts attributed to Hippocrates, the father of medicine. Were they to attempt to live literally by those writings, known collectively as the Corpus, the practice of modern medicine would radically change. A literal interpretation of the writings would mean withholding a patient's diagnosis from his insurance company, thereby depriving him of reimbursement, and perhaps even from the patient himself. The ethical writings would prohibit any surgery or public health education and would make virtually impossible the existing structure of medical education because paying other doctors for instruction would be prohibited, according to some interpretations. The writings would bar all abortions, and perhaps prohibit doctors from giving birth control advice. Fee‐splitting, which doctors now consider unethical, would be permitted. The Hippocratic writings also urge doctors not to begin by discussing fees with patients, to make frequent visits and not to put laymen in charge of anything. These concepts clash with attempts to cut costs by training para‐professionals to do tasks traditionally performed only by doctors. If the oath were interpreted literally, physicians who did not conceal most things from their patients would incur the wrath of their colleagues. In the public's mind, the Hippocratic Oath symbolizes the physician's dedication to healing and the fundamental bond of trust among the patient, the physician and the medical profession. Yet the oath has no legal status, it is not a requirement for receiving an M.D. degree and there are no penalties for violating it. Many other medical oaths have been written and sworn to, but the most widely known is that of Hippocrates, who was born in 479 B.C. and died in 399 B.C. and who is believed by many historians to have been the intellectual leader of a school of medical thought that grew up around the temple cult on the Greek island of Kos. The oath has been amended and rewritten so many times to meet the changes in society that no standard version exists and not all doctors swear by the same one. “The Hippocratic Oath is a guild document, museum piece, an amiable but useless custom,” said Dr. Carleton B. Chapman, president of The Commonwealth Fund here. “For centuries the Oath has been viewed sentimentally and uncritically by the medical profession as its ethical standard and has, rather paradoxically, served as a barrier to development of an adequate and comprehensive ethical statement for the profession.” In some countries, doctors have not sworn by the oath for decades. Swedish doctors last took it in 1887, and now adhere to rules adopted by Swedish medical and governmental officials. A 1969 survey of British medical schools found only two that included the oath as part of the graduation ceremonies. In fact, no one knows how many American doctors take the oath. The Association ot American Medical Colleges has not surveyed its member institutions to learn how many offer it because, a spokesman said, it was “such a trivial issue.” Nevertheless, because of heightened concern about ethics, officials of New York University and some other medical schools are seriously considering offering the Hippocratic Oath and others to incoming medical students instead of those about to graduate. “Not giving the Oath of Hippocrates would leave a void and a feeling of unfuifillmentin the people who are graduating,” said Dr. Saul J Farber, dean for academic affairs and head of medicine at N.Y.U.'s medical school “It's something they dream about, part of the ceremony of becoming a doctor.” At the same time, those who see the oath as irrelevant to contemporary society are critical of political leaders who chide doctors for not living up to the Hippocratic Oath. The late Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller once criticized New York doctors on those grounds when a group of physicians spoke out against a 20 percent cut in fees paid by the state for Medicaid patients. Dr. Chapman, the Commonwealth Fund president and a physician who has studied the classics and law, among those who contend that the Hippocratic Oath should be “honorably retired.” He challenged not only the medical profession but lawyers and academics to write new codes of ethics that are geared to patient, client and student needs respectively. But even if new codes are written, one tenet surely will remain: “Physician, do no harm.”"
Charities Plan an Organized Challenge to ‘Monopoly’ of United Way,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/02/archives/charities-plan-an-organized-challenge-to-monopoly-of-united-way.html,"DALLAS, May 1— United Way, the nation's biggest and best‐known charity fund‐raiser, is under increasingly bitter assault by a host of small charities that charge that it is systematically cutting them off from the best, surest and cheapest source of donations payroll deductions in offices. factoriesand storer. United Way's assertion that it “works for all of us” is simply false, the attackers contend, because the nationwide “organization has monopolized fund raising in the workplace. A wide range of worthy nonprofit groups have been excluded from sharing in the proceeds, they Say. United Way has stoutly defended its policies, and the debate has gone on somewhat disjointedly. But in the last three days; the conflict has sharpened considerably, raising the possibility that private charity may be in for a major upheaval. In fact, a new national fund‐raising movement, competing with the $1‐billion‐a‐year United Way, may have been born here. First National Strategy While 1,500 United Way volunteers were holding their annual meeting at the Fairmont Hotel, rePresentatives of some 70 dissenting groups gathered in a counter‐convention eight blocks away in the Hotel “Adolphus. There, for the first time, they considered a national strategy for breaking what they ‘consider United Way's.dominance. Among the tactics tentatively approved were boycotts of local United Way campaigns; formation of local fundraising federations to compete directly with United Way in the workplace; and campaigns,to convince employers to let these, federations use payroll deductions. The counter‐convention, planned to coincide with the United Way meeting, hardly went unnoticed at the Fairmont. While the dissenters were castigating United Way, John W. Hanley, its national chairman, was telling representatives of his organization's local groups that “the future can pass right by us.’ “If that happens,” he said, “I'll lay good odds the post‐mortem will show that we could have foreseen and forestalled the fatal strains between our organizations and society.” Those who “feel left out,” he conceded, “may be closer to genuine emerging needs.” And he said United Way officials were “seriously re‐examining our institution in light of their criticism.” The dissidents, however, seemed to agree with Robert O. Bothwell, executive director of the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, the Washington‐based group that organized the counter‐convention. He said, “History Just doesn't suggest that the United Way can reform itself.” The key dispute between the two camps is over access to payroll deductions. In the last 30 years, United Way has built its successes on one main instrument: the right to solicit in the workplace on behalf of a wide array of charities. Employers have come to prefer this “one‐time” sblicitation to a multiplicity of campaigns. Mr. Hanley and other United Way executives deny charges that this has meant a monopoly on fund raising, pointing out that employers decide who can solicit on their premises. The critics, however, say United Ways and the business community are often so closely allied that they exercise monopolistic control. The problem, say the dissidents; is that “safe” or “old‐line” organizations like the Boy Scouts share most of the proceeds, while many newer organizations, some of them controversial, are shut out. Abortion clinics are cited as one example, as are women's groups, environmentalist organizationS, minority‐run charities and numerous health and arts groups. Women's and Minority Groups Such oranizations accounted for most of the 49 groups that sponsored the counter‐convention, includft the Sierra Club, the National Organization for Women's legal defense and education fund, the Gray Panthers, Zero Population Growth, the National Puerto Rican Coalition and the National Black United Fund, which attemptt to compete with United Way in several localities. Mr. Hanley, in an interview, said that he saw no reason why arts and environmentav. ‘loups could not be admitted to United Way membership. But when asked about the possibility of assisting abortion clinics, Mr. Hanley, the chairman and chief executive officer of the Monsanto Company, replied: “Do you think they can come into Monsanto or any corporation and get Monsanto to be enthusiastic about putting on payroll deduction 'something as controversial as that?” Some United Way officials acknowledge a ticklish position in this regard: If their organization becomes too exclusive and shies away from controversy, it risks becoming irrelevant, but lilt attracts too much controversy, it risks losing the broad community, consensus that has been the basis of its success. United Way officials also fear that if workplace solicitation is opened up to competing groups, the value of the “one appeal” approach will be lost. Donors will split their total gift, it is argued, and employers might eventually rebel at the multiplicity of campaigns."
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/02/archives/letters-what-it-takes-to-unsnarl-new-york-city-for-subway-safety-on.html,"To the Editor: Mayor Koch's traffic proposals (news story April 24) are dandy as a first step, but, as Daniel Burnham said, “Make no little plans, they have no magic to stir men's blood” — or their vehicles. New York City has indulged itself for years in a laissez‐faire attitude toward the movement of goods and people, a decision that can only be explained as politically convenient. The city, as a well‐known result, is strangling. Logistic bedlam is driving out our manufacturing and irdustrial concerns, while a crosstown cab ride will convince most executives that their companies could operate more efficiently in Westchester, Connecticut or the Sun Belt. Group taxi riding from airports is fine — if the taxis can move once they are in the city. Limiting much of 49th and 50th Streets to buses and cabs front 11 A.M. to 4 P.M. on workdays win help; we also need to free every major crosstown street from 14th to 96th from any daytime parking, and mandate only non‐rush‐hour deliveries. Allowing no parking in the bus lanes of several Manhattan avenues would be of enormous benefit (if enforce), but obviously all of the city's “bus avenues” must be free of parking from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M., with deliveries and standing‐only in non‐rush periods. Today double‐parking (most of it necessary truck deliveries) on both sides of much of Lexington and Madison Avenues is routine, thus at times only one traffic lane is open: urban hara‐kiri. Moreover, there is probably not a working day when the midtown east side of Fifth Avenue and the west of Madison — our two finest nonresidential streets — are not garaged with cars of foreign diplomats, consuls, press, the handicapped and assorted chums of City Hall. It is pertinent to note that Washington tolerates no parking transgression on the part of its diplomatic corps. Although New York licenses private tow‐away companies to whisk to the car pound any ticketed automobile thus effectively dealing with scofflaw out—of‐staters — efforts here could obviously be redoubled. Most cities will Immediately slap a ticket on a car or truck that blocks an intersection. Almost never, it seems, New York though the daily fines would more than pay for the added police. Some cities, praise be, even give summonses to hum‐blowers, the night and day tickets paying for the police blowercatcher. It is time, past time, for an awakening, for a determined, indeed drastic, overhaul of our means of expediting that essential index of urban survival: movement. We have winked too long at those who are choking our city and its — and our — future. Mayor Koch. it's all yours. G. E. KIDDER SMITH New York, April 25 1979 Kimble Mood For Subway Safety, One‐Car Trains To the Editor: There must be a less expensive and more permanent solution to the crime crisis on the subways of New York City than a continual, massive police presence. During weeknight off‐peak hours and on weekends, four‐ or five‐car trains rim on a 20‐to‐15‐minute headway (scheduled time between trains). This gives those so inclined ample time to “case” the situation, execute a crime and escape. I would suggest that the trains be trimmed to one car, manned by one man, the motorman, and run on a 7‐to5‐minute headway so that the longest wait at a station would be less than 10 minutes. The motorman could have access to the door aparatus, and with the aid of a rear‐view mirror would be able to view all the car's doors for safety in closing them. Several rail transport systems currently have such an arrangement. This technique would: • Cut by about two‐thirds the labor cost per train (eliminating conductor and policeman). • Keep everyone bunched in one car for safety in numbers as well as near the motorman, who has a two‐way radio. • Keep the waiting time on the platform to a minimum, giving far less opportunity for foul play and, as suggested by a previous letter to the editor, make it feasible to screen off a one‐car area on each platform, which would be well‐lit, as close as possible to a change booth and surveyed on closed‐circuit TV. If these innovations were instituted, it would be difficult for a malefactor to be successful. One hopes that the affected unions would cooperate, in the interest of their riders’ safety, by training those conductors who wished to become one‐car motormen. DAVID C. CLARK Oyster Bay, L.I., April 24, 1979 Compassionate Service By the National Guard To the Editor: Please allow me this opportunity to express my admiration for the high professionalism displayed by members of the New York State National Guard during the current prison guard strike. Despite picket‐line impediments, the men of the Rainbow Division are compassionatly performing their life‐support and custodial duties with unflinching efficiency and thus have gained the respect and cooperation of their less fortunate brothers. Should leaders of Council 82 of the Correctional Officers Union instill in their membership the same professional and humane qualities, perhaps there would be less recidivism. JOSEPH MCCRORY Dannemora, N.Y., April 22, 1979 The writer is currently serving a I2to‐25 year prison sentence at the Clinton Correctional Facility for armed robbery. Where Federal Aid To Housing Goes To the Editor: Last May 17, you reported approval by the Board of Estimate of Booth Towers, a high‐rise project where subsidies (tax‐free to the recipient) could exceed $6,000 a year. Mayor Koch is quoted as saying that the city would no longer approve “high‐rise, high‐cost” housing requiring city funds for land acquisition and tenant relocation. On April 13, 1979, you described a Section 8 residential rehabilitation project on West 135th Street for which Federal subsidies may amount to $7,500 per unit per year, with the possibility of further increases. (This does not appear to be a city‐aided project.) The magnitude of this subsidy, which exceeds animal housing expenditures for most American families, confirms the fears of those of us concerned with efficiency and equity of Federal housing subsidies as well as their political acceptance. It is clear there are not sufficient Section 8 funds — nor are there likely to be in the forseeable future — to have a major impact on New York City's housing problem. Does this represent the best use of housing subsidy funds for New York City? Max R. BLOOM Professor of Real Estate and Urban Land Economics Syracuse University Syracuse, April 17, 1979 A Muffled Voice of the P.L.O. To the Editor: Phil Baum of the American Jewish Congress (letter April 18) is correct in saying there is no excuse for the State Department's policy with respect to the visa it granted to Shafik al‐Hout of the Palestine Liberation Organization. But he protests for the wrong reasons. What is really outrageous is not the granting of the visa but the restrictions placed upon it. Under the terms imposed, Mr. Hout cannot be invited to address public gatherings, and he is to avoid publicity. (I presume, for example, that though his presence can be attacked by Mr. Baum, he may not respond.) Americans who meet with him in small groups must promise in advance not to report what he says; if they break the promise the visa will be canceled. It need not concern us whether any rights Mr. Mout may have as a visitor to this country are being infringed. What ought to bother us is that these restrictions demote all but a few Americans from the rank of citizen to the status of subject. In their conduct of foreign policy, Mr. Vance and Mr. Carter act in the name of the people. How can they presume to protect the people from acquiring first‐hand knowledge about the P.L.O., a principal factor in a conflict deeply affecting our interests? Along with a very eminent member of the American Jewish Congress and other persons critical of the P.L.O., I was present at a meeting with Mr. Hout in New York City. All present were free to challenge his statements and to assess for themselves the credibility of his responses. I am sure all who took part came away with a better (and not necessarily a more favorable) grasp of the P.L.O as an institution and of its strategy. That makes us supercitizens, members of an elite. Unlike other Americans, we were permitted to risk infection, provided we were willing to immunize ourselves by our silence as to the substance of the meeting. Though I am a journalist, I cannot let the readers of my publication know whatever I may have learned by witnessing this exchange. Mr. Vance is acting in this matter as my superior officer, not as a civil servant. What purpose can these restrictions serve, other than to protect the department from criticism even harsher than Mr. Baum's? Israel's posture toward the P.L.O. is Israel's business. Whether the United States should adhere to a similar stance ought to be a function of knowledge widely shared among Americans, knowledge gained not by proxy through agencies such as the Administration or other interested parties, but directly from the source. ROBERT G. HOYT Executive Editor Christianity and Crisis New York, April 19, 1979 ‘Dire Consequences’ of a Ban on Medicaid Abortions To the Editor: We are writing in response to Representative Ron Paul's April 18 letter, which criticized Planned Parenthood's March 27 ad in The Times. Our ad supported the continuation of New York State's current policy of paying for abortions under the Medicaid program. Representative Paul's position indicates his lack of awareness of the facts. Despite Congress's punitive action of eliminating 99 percent of all federally funded abortions in the U.S. through the Hyde Amendment, 17 states continue to provide abortions for Medicaid‐eligible women by using state funds ‐ seven of them under the constraint of court orders These states provided 80 percent of the government‐funded abortions in the U.S. in the year immediately prior to the Federal cutback. That's why the dire consequences predicted in our ad by Senator Edward M Kennedy and by Dr. Willard Cates Jr of the U.S Center for Disease Control have not occurred in large volume They serve as a warning of what could happen in New York State if similar restrictions were imposed In the states which have adopted the restrictive Federal polity, the data show that Medicaid‐dependent women have been forced to delay their procedures an average of two weeks ‐ increasing their risks of medical complications by 20 percent each week Many have used their meager welfare allotments to pay for their abortions. (Because the average cost of an abortion is more than the average monthly Aid to Families with Dependent Children grant for a mother with two children, families have been deprived of essentials). Other women have sought the services of illegal abortionists, and for some this has resulted in permanent physical health damage. Obviously, women with no capacity to raise the money and those who are afraid to resort to self‐induced or “back alley” abortions have carried their pregnancies to term — bearing unwanted children. Representative Paul must understand that more tragedies would surely occur if the larger provider states, such as New York, California’ and Illinois, turned away the 210,000 Medicaid‐eligible women who seek to terminate their pregnancies each year. Fortunately, New York State has recently reaffirmed its enlightened public policy of paying for abortion for the 50,000 New York women who depend on Medicaid for their health care. We hope that the strength and courage of our Washington representatives will parallel that of our New York State legislators, who have demonstrated that public policy with respect to health care must be based on principles of fairness and safety.> MARY D. LINDSAY PAULINE L. HARRISON ALFRED F. MORAN New York, April 20, 1979 The writers are, respectively, chairman of the board, president and executive vice president of Planned Parenthood of New York City."
"Bush, With a Promise Of ‘Candor,’ Declares His G.O.P. Candidacy",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/02/archives/bush-with-a-promise-of-candor-declares-his-gop-candidacy-strives.html,"WASHINGTON, May 1 — George Bush, former Director of Central Intelligence, announced his candidacy for the Presidency today as a “lifelong Republican” and pledged to support military strength, limited Federal spending and “a new candor.” Mr. Bush immediately set off on a campaign swing of states that have early primaries. His support has come mainly from the party's moderates, although few of his stands dismay Republican conservatives. At a luncheon in Hartford he won cheers when he recalled the service of his father, Prescott Bush, as a Connecticut Senator, and when he said, “I'm tired of apologizing for this...country. We are the fairest, we're the Most decent, we've been the most generous, and we should hold up our heads.” Strives for Excitement Promising the country “the principled, stable leadership we must have in the decade of the eighties,” Mr. Bush sought in his announcement here and at his later campaign stops to introduce a note of excitement. That element has thus far largely failed to accompany a careful campaign effort that has raised money, assembled a varied and experienced campaign staff and won important party allies in some critical early states, such as Iowa and New Hampshire. Mr. Bush is widely regarded as in competition with Howard H. Baker Jr., the Senate minority leader, for the allegiance of their party's weaker moderate wing. But, while his earlier start has won him more prominent supporters than the late‐starting Tennessean, it has not yet, in a period when the nonpoliticians are scarcely noticing Presidential politics, gained him much in the way of public recognition and support. Although he has occasionally angered conservatives, by voting for open housing in the House of Representatives in 1968, for example, or by aiding party reformers while serving as Republican national chairman from 1973 to 1974, Mr. Bush hews a conservative line on issues from the Panama Canal to a strategic arms treaty and on to Federal funding of abortions.. Sees Reagan Leading Race He declined, at a news conference here, to criticize either,Ronald Reagan, the former California Governor, who he agreed was leading the race for the 1980 Republican nomination, or his fellow Houston resident, John B. Connally, whose own campaign, in a mirror image of Mr. Bush's, had been longer on excitement than organIzation. But he did emphasize some differences with the two others, who he conceded currently lead him in his home state of Texas, first by describing himself as a“lifelong Republican.” That cannot be matched either by Mr. Connally, a former Democratic Governor of Texas, or by Mr. Reagan, who was a Democrat before he entered partisan politics. “I understand this party. I worked in the precincts,” Mr. Bush said. Mr. Bush also promised to make a complete financial disclosure, down to the number of shares he holds in various concerns, release of his tax returns and making public a balance sheet so his worth could be established. In an interview, he said that he had begun pushing for financial disclosure in the House in 1967. He estimated his current worth at 81.3 or 81.4 million. Halls Disclosure Benefits Financial disclosure, he said, “helps lower the cynical view of attitudes towards politics.” Both Mr. Reagan and Mr. Connally have resisted this sort of detailed financial disclosure in the past as an invasion of privacy. His other major claim to a unique status in the Republican field was his breadth of experience. The field includes Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut; Harold E. Stassen, former Governor of Minnesota; Benjamin Fernandez, a Los Angeles businessman; Senator Robert Dole of Kansas, and Representatives Philip M. Crane and John B. Anderson of Illinois. Mr. Bush cited his understanding of the free enterprise system, which he said had been developed when he founded and ran his own business, in oil drilling and equipment. He entered the oil business in Texas in 1948, moving there after graduating from Yale, where he had captained the baseball team, been president of his class and been a member of Phi Beta Kappa, the., academic fraternity, and of Skull and Bones, the prestigious secret society. Before entering Yale, he had been a Navy fighter pilot, winning the Distinguished Flying Cross after being shot down near the Bonin Islands in the Western Pacific. Mr. Bush also siid “being in Congress, not too long, incidentally, is an asset.” He served from 1967 to 1971, giving up the seat for an unsuccessful race for the Senate in 1970. He also lost a Senate bid in .1964. He contended, “My practical experience in foreign affairs and national security would qualify me” for the Presidency. After his Senate defeat, he was the United States representative to the United Nations to 1973, then Republican chairman until 1979, trying to hold the .party together as the Watergate scandal ‘engulfed it. President Ford named him to head the United States liaison office in Peking in September 1974, and early in 1976 brought him back to head the C.I.A. That last experience is one the 54‐year‘old Mr. Bush cites effectively as he campaigns. In a recent, well‐received tour of Iowa, he stressed, “I've dealt with some of the world's leaders,” and argued, “We've got to get off the back of the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. and strengthen these institutions.” Asked today in Hartford about C.I.A. assassination attempts, he cited the possibility of having assassinated Adolf Hitler to show that such an act might sometimes be justified. Firmness in Foreign Policy On the campaign trail, Mr. Bush, like other Republicans, argues hard for firmness in foreign policy. In Dallas Center Iowa, he said that while “I don't believe in rattling sabers.. . .if we are undepend able, we are vacillating, we pull back, it doesn't take long for the rest of the world” to take advantage. That Iowa visit also demonstrated one of Mr. Bush's problems. Many of his Iowa backers indicated that their first choice would be to have Gov. Robert D. Ray run as a favorite son. In New Hampshire, some of his prominent supporters would really prefer Elliot L. Richardson, the former Cabinet officer, and in many parts of the country, he is the second choice of adherents of former President Ford. In his news conference today, Mr. Bush said he could not yet identify the areas where he wanted Federal spending checked, although he called for a growth in defense spending. He contended that excessive government regulation added greatly to inflation. Mr. Bush also supported compulsory registration of young men, but not necessarily a renewed draft, and said he opposed letting Federal funds be used to pay for abortions. “Leadership in the eighties,” he proclaimed, “must be based on a politics of substance, not symbols, of reason, not bombast, of frankness, not false promise.”"
Hers,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/03/archives/hers.html,"IHAVE lived almost all of my life in a drip‐dry world, but I remember well the laundress who used to appear once a week in our kitchen and who spent much of her time in it steaming the place up. All other activity in the kitchen was suspended until 5 in the afternoon, when the laundress would depart, leaving behind her tall stacks of perfectly pressed and folded articles of clothing, table and bed linens. Because there were gas‐heated drying closets in our kitchen and in the basement of the apartment building we lived in, all of the work could be accomplished in the course of one day. I seem to remember that most of the washing was done in large tubs or in machines in the basement laundry room, but that the important things, the starching and the pressing, were done upstairs where I could and did watch from time to time. Starch was cooked: a thick bluish porridge in a white enameled pot. The laundress stirred and stirred and when the consistency of the mixture was at a point that only she could determine as the correct one, she would pick up one shirt or dress or napkin at a time and dip it quickly into the porridge. The starched item was laid out to dry on toweling spread on all the surfaces in the kitchen for this purpose. Within a short time, everything was angular and stiff, as if inhabited by rigid ghosts. Some of the place mats were so heavily starched that I could stand them up like large cards to make houses with. Handkerchiefs resembled matzohs, white and brittle. Our cotton dresses had a life of their own. Before being pressed, the clothes had to be sprinkled damp again and were rolled in a tubular fashion. The ironing was tricky. Too hot and scorch marks materialized; too cool and the wrinkles wouldn't go away. For certain difficult areas you had to use a special sleeve board, a device that was small and rounded like my plump arm. Some fabrics required a damp pressing cloth. A complexity of technique was involved in doing the job right. I was always allowed to iron my own hair ribbons if happened to be hanging around, and I could never keep them flat on the board without endangering my fingers. The ribbons curled away from me and I got mad and burned myself. Some of our laundresses hummed as they ironed, stroking the clothes in dizzy syncopation with a tune whose words they clearly preferred to keep to themselves. Some of them just slammed away, ripping off buttons and tearing even bigger holes in the openwork embroidery of whatever delicate thing they had on the ironing board. I always noticed, and could never understand, that when the laundress was a hummer the cook usually stayed in her room. The laundry is not important now except that it stands for me. My laundering was a process that took place in rooms other than the kitchen and over a period of long years. My laundresses were of both genders and differing ages, parents and teachers and friends and strangers, and I doubt that many of them ever considered the abrasive qualities of such a thorough cleansing. At first it was so simple. As stains could kill, for instance, I always smelled of Clorox. In the event that I might drop dead on the street one day, I had to be immaculate enough to please whoever might rush over to pick me up, although I could never really believe that anyone would want to remove my underclothes to check them out. Then intricacies set in. White gloves had a function other than keeping hands neat and warm. They were emblematic, signifying my membership in a club whose rules were universally accepted, universally enforced. I was as starched, as disciplined, as the blouses I wore to school every day, ironed as smooth as manners could make me, as correctly folded and stored away in a drawer to be used when the right occasion presented itself. From cleanliness of clothing, polished, I soon graduated to a general wash‐up of a more enduring variety. I could not be wet, hot, rumpled or soiled. These were not ways to be seen or to be, such states suggesting as they did dirt of a deeper nature, fundamental mire. Like the invisible filth on the label of the cans of Old Dutch scouring powder that used to sit under all our sinks, I was chased, chastised, by a little enraged lady whose face was always blurry because water had dripped on it. She was driving me away from my body, it seemed, into a world of clean, of safe, of marriage. It is true that at the time the consequences of dirty were tremendous: babies or dangerously illegal abortions, disgrace or unwanted wedlock, disease, vile and perpetual depravity. It is true. So I was laundered and the remarkable, ridiculous thing is that I still am, still safe and married and more spotless than not, still scarred by having been scraped clean down to the bone. I am an anachronism, and although I no longer squeeze my fingers into those white gloves I feel I am still stiff and rightangled, unable to slacken up on myself and my sense of the fitness of things. I am still not rid of the ghosts I used to see in our laundry, and they continue to spook my take on the indulgent landscape I inhabit but can not live in. I am still sitting in the blue porridge of starch. Blue bruises and bluenosed, bluestocking, blue‐chipped and, in my way, blue‐blooded, blue‐penciler of blue laws for my children who are blind to the blue I see, blue‐ribboned, as blue as blued once and the dipping sticks, mostly in my throat these days. I am as uncomfortable as my dresses ever were, more permanently pressed and soil‐resistant than anything on sale today. I crackle, unbending, and I make the kind of noises no one wants to listen to anymore, the kind made by fresh, starched shirts as you unfold them on a morning when the sky is as blue as the blade of a razor, cutting. Still polar, I go crosseyed trying to focus on a true‐blue north. I still see virtues and villainies where so many others see sweet nothing because they have set themselves down on such a cushy point of magnetic indifference. The earth has turned over 10 thousand times in as many ways since I ironed ribbons that curl, still, away from me and I am tired of being told that I missed out on modern, tired of having rectitude held against me by the lotus‐eaters and the polymorphs. I'm tired and I wouldn't mind lying down too on sheets that are soft to the skin, a pleasure. What was true is no longer true, not really possible and certainly not useful. Clean has been disqualified and so, it seems, have I. The Hers column was created as a forum for women writers. For the next several weeks it will be written by Lucienne S.

Panel Narrowly Backs Agency on Education; House Battle Is Likely,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/03/archives/panel-narrowly-backs-agency-on-education-house-battle-is-likely.html,"WASHINGTON, May 2 — A bill to create a new department of education squeezed through a House committee today by a one‐vote margin, but faced an uncertain fate on the House floor. While the senate approved establishment of the new Cabinet‐level department earlier this week by a wide margin, 72 to 21, the House is expected to be the real battleground for the Administrationbacked proposal. Approval of the bill by the House Government Operations Committee came on a vote of 20 to 19, as tense spectators in the crowded hearing room listened breathlessly as each vote was cast. Voting for the bill were 18 Democrats and two Republicans, Representative Frank Horton of upstate New York, the ranking minority member of the committee, and Representative Lyle Williams of Ohio. Voting against the proposal were the 12 other Republicans on the committee and seven Democrats, including Representatives Benjamin S. Rosenthal of Queens and Ted Weiss of Manhattan. Erosion of support for the proposed new department was reflected in today's committee vote. A somewhat broader bill cleared the same committee last year by a vote of 27 to 15, but the measure failed to reach the House floor because of the adjournment rush. Both Mr. Rosenthal and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, have argued for many months that the secretary of the proposed department would be faced with unbearable pressures from a single‐issue interest group. Most Cabinet‐level departments, they contend, are faced with many issues and thus are not subject to the kind of pressure that would be exerted by the education lobby. The fight on the House floor is certain to be a lively one, with opponents of the bill already threatening to attach an amendment that would permit prayers in public schools and another to curb abortions. A floor fight is also likely over the committee's decision today, on a vote of 17 to 11, to transfer responsibility for Indian schools from the Department of the Interior to the proposed department of education. No such provision is in the Senate‐passed bill. The committee approval of the bill was hailed by the White House. But Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers, which opposes the propoSed department, predicted that the bill would be defeated on the House floor."
Other Ideas & Trends,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/06/archives/other-ideas-trends-abortion-statistics-hodgkins-disease-doubts.html,"Ten years ago, abortion was the most common method of birth control. Last week the Population Crisis Committee reported that the method had dropped to third place, after sterilization and the pill. But on the average, one of every four pregnancies around the world is still terminated by abortion. The rate is even higher — more than 1 in 2 — in Austria, Italy, Japan, Portugal, the Soviet Union and Uruguay, where the most effective methods of contraception are not generally available. In all, 40 million abortions are performed every year, more than half of them illegally. Hodgkin's disease sometimes strikes more than one person in the same family, school or neighborhood, leading to speculation that this form of cancer might be contagious. But last week researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health said the latest studies suggest that this is “unlikely.” The doctors compared two groups of high school graduates, one from schools where Hodgkin's disease had occurred between 1960 and 1964, the other from schools where it had not. Charting the incidence of the disease through 1969, the doctors found no significant difference between the two groups. Transportation Secretary Brock Adams was embarrassed. Last fall he moved the low‐floor Transbus to a central place in the Government's plan to make public transportation accessible to the handicapped. Last week bids to build 530 of the special vehicles were to have been opened, but there wasn't a bid open; no companies want to build the buses. Usually it's girls who sue to play on boys’ teams, but Donald Gomes, 19 years old and a high school senior in Providence, R.I., went to court because he wants to play on the all‐female volleyball team at his school, which has no boys’ team. Last week Federal Judge Raymond J. Pettine said the youth must be allowed to play. Mr. Gomes cannot be entirely happy about his victory, however, because the judge was frank, in public, about his athletic prowess. “In the light of his relatively limited ability,” Judge Pettine said, “there is little possibility that his participation would substantially disrupt league play or provide one team with a disproportionate advantage.”"
Ideas &Trends,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/06/archives/ideas-trends-in-summary-the-high-court-finds-words-for-the-mentally.html,"Except in mathematics, absolute proof is more often an ideal to be sought than a goal to be reached, a fact the courts recognize by setting varying standards of proof for different kinds of cases. Most civil suits are decided on the basis of a “preponderance of the evidence.” In criminal law, the standard is higher, requiring proof “beyond a reasonable doubt.” Last week the United States Supreme Court set what Chief Justice Warren E. Burger called an “intermediate” standard for committing mental patients. In a unanimous ruling, the Court said that no one can be sent to a mental hospital without “clear and convincing” evidence that the person is both mentally ill and dangerous. That is more proof than now required in about 15 states. Writing for the Court, Chief Justice Burger said that “the lack of certainty and the fallibility of psychiatric diagnosis” make it difficult to meet the strict criminal standard in most cases and may “erect an unreasonable barrier to needed medical treatment.” But the civil standard, he wrote, is too low to protect the right of due process guaranteed by the Constitution. The effect of the ruling in actual practice is unclear. “Particular standatd‐of‐proof catchwords do not always make a great difference in a particular case,” the Chief Justice acknowledged, because no one knows just what the words may mean to jurors who decide specific cases. Nevertheless, Justice Burger said, “Adopting a standard of proof is more than an empty semantic exercise. In cases involving individual rights, the standard of proof at a minimum reflects the value society places on individual liberty.” The decision arose from a case in which the Texas Supreme Court found a preponderance of evidence sufficient to let a mother commit her son, who had argued that the “beyond reasonable doubt” standard should prevail. The case now goes back to Texas courts for reconsideration. Over the last 30 years, the refrain that has rung in the ears of charity solicitors has been: “1 gave at the office.” With few exceptions, what people gave to was the United Way, which has built its success as a $1‐billiona‐year federated fundraiser on the right to solicit at the workplace in one‐shot campaign. All that may change, if a new national fund‐raising movement achieves some of its ends. During United Way's annual meeting in Dallas last week, representatives of some 70 dissenting charities held a counterconvention. They tentatively approved tactics for breaking what they say is United Way's monopoly: boycotts of local United Way campaigns; local drives to compete with United. Way directly; persuading employers to allow other organizations to collect funds by payroll deduction. United Way denies it is a monopoly, saying it collects only $1 billion of a national total of $30 billion a year in philanthropic giving. Dissident organizations say $1 billion is an enormous share of what is given by working individuals, and that United Way gives most of it to “safe” causes such as the Red Cross and the Boy Scouts; excluding womens', environmentalist and minority‐run groups, the arts and anything controversial. Planned Parenthood, for example, has 189 local chapters, and their cause has become sufficiently noncontroversial that 47 chapters are included in local United Way drives. But in recent years, Planned Parenthood chapters have begun to offer abortion services, and the chapter in Gary, Ind., was dropped from its local United Way the year it did so. Usually it's the Indians who claim they were euchred out of their ancestral territories by a perfidious Government. This time, it's a group of black people in Georgia who are trying to establish that in 1943 the Government took their land away from them for use as an airhase, promising to return it after the war. Instead, the land was incorporated into what is now the Harris Neck National Wildlife Refuge, and the Interior Department says they don't intend to give it up. About 40 protestors camped out in the refuge last week, and four of them were later arrested and sentenced for contempt of court. Meanwhile, lawyers for the group are searching county records of titles and land transactions in a search for evidence in support of the blacks’ claims. The landholders in 1943 were largely unsophisticated, and none of their successors has so far been able to produce documents supporting their contentions. Their complaints are based on memory and, it may yet turn out, on legend. It is also possible that documents may show the original possessors were compensated at fair value. Federal officials have urged the demonstrators to seek redress in the courts or by petitioning Congress. But national civil rights strategists on the scene believe that without a dramatic confrontatton that attracts national attention, the issue is likely to be ignored. In addition, they believe, the Harris Neck affair may awaken black support for a civil rights movement that has recently been quiescent. Founded by three upwardly mobile Chicago businessmen and one gifted editor, Esquire was for 45 years a middle‐class wishbook, an impressive literary showcase and finally a standard‐bearer of the New Journalism. Then it lost its way. Last week an unlikely combination of salvage operators announced that they had bought it. They were the Bonnier Newspaper Group of Sweden and two Knoxville bachelors, Christopher Whittle and Phillip Moffitt, who publish what are called in the trade “youth‐oriented” magazines. Clay Felker, the ex‐editor of New York magazine and the departing mastermind at Esquire, said he was leaving behind a property “on the upswing in every way.” Through its downswing, Esquire is thought to have lost $5 million between 1975 and 1977, and possibly another $5 million in 1978. The Knoxville owners, once roommates at the University of Tennessee, will restore Esquire's monthly schedule and spend $5 million to revamp it. In a full‐page newspaper advertisement elaborating on their plans, they maintained that “today's man is searching for an identity, a context.” Their goal is helping men “grapple with the changing perception of what manhood is.” And what about Mr. Felker? He will develop film properties for 20th Century Fox. But he hasn't given up on magazines; in his head, he says, he has the germ of an idea for a new one. “Courts were once the theater of the people,” Federal District Judge Jack B. Weinstein of Brooklyn told a group of law students two years ago. “Now they are remote and largely unintelligible institutions, more like a mysterious private rite than an exercise in public governance.” Judge Weinstein was arguing that the best way to dispel the mystery is to open the courts to radio and television. Since his plea, the number of states permitting electronic trial coverage on a permanent or experimental basis has grown to more than 20. Last week New Jersey joined the experimenters. With the approval of the state Supreme Court, television and still cameras recorded the murder trial of Ricky Newsome in Atlantic City. The trial was not particularly newsworthy in itself, but it may have a decisive effect on the outcome of the long controversy over cameras in courtrooms. After a year, or after six trials have been covered electronically whichever comes first — the Supreme Court will decide whether or not to approve such coverage on a regular basis. The experiment is limited to Atlantic and Bergen Counties and to cases that do not involve juveniles, rape, divorce or trade secrets. The press will ask judges for permission to cover particular trials and are generally expected to get it. Only one television station can film a given trial, and it must let other stations use its film. In the Newsome trial, Judge Manuel H. Greenberg counseled the jurors, “The photographers will not take pictures of you. Act as though they were not here. Concentrate on the trial.” The main opposition came from the defendant's lawyer, Nathan W. Davis Jr., who said he was worried about “being a guinea pig.” He felt unsure, he said; about the effect of television on the jurors. Albert J. Garofolo, assistant prosecutor for Atlantic County, said he thought the cameras might “divest people of some of the. impressions they get from watching Perry Mnson"
CONNECTICUT JOURNAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/06/archives/connecticut-weekly-connecticut-journal-getting-the-boot.html,"FIRST it came to Greenwich and now it's in Westport, a diabolical new regulatory weapon that could be even more maddening to errant car owners than having their vehicles impounded. If it's any consolation, they can blame Denver — or maybe France. The device is known locally as the Ilenver boot for the city that first used it in this country, although there is another version, the French boot, which was imported for use in Washington, a few years ago. Both versions use a heavy metal clamp designed to likk onto a car wheel, immobilizing the vehicle. As with cars towed away, the owner has to pay up before reclaiming the property. Far cheaper and with greater enforcement potential than towing, the Denver boot is aimed at scofflaws. A month ago, the Westport selectmen approved its use and last week the first boot arrived, a sort of gunfighter brought in to restore law and order to those who have been riding roughshod over traffic regulations. But so fearsome is the power of the bpot (including, perhaps, the possibility of its kicking up damage suits) that potential victims are due for a series of warnings before it is used that should remove any possibility of surprise. Dominic Rutigliano, the Westport Awn Counsel, said that car owners with 10 or more outstanding parking tickets incurred over a two‐month period would be notified by mail to pay up,. If they don't, a warning will be placed on their car. And if that is igmired, watch out for the boot. When a small company in a new inustry gets a big contract, it's important to make a good impression, which is why Solar Processes Inc. of Mystic Sept five persons, nearly everyone it employs, to install the 32‐panel water heating system on the roof of the West Wing of the White House. “Is it exciting? Of course it's excitdig,” said Ronald Chick, one of the nwners of the 18‐month‐old company, in telephone. interview. He had been Summoned to the phone by a helpful Setret Service agent. ‐Has President Carter taken an interest in the project? “I've talked to him many times. He was up on the roof last Friday, he and Rosalynn,” said Mr. Chick. Some of the steel work for the $28,000 system was done by another Connecticut group, the Southeast Regional Vocational Technical School, of Groton. When complete, the 600‐gallon system will save energy by preheating water on its way to a conventional water heater. It will serve bathrooms and a kitchen in the West Wing, where die Oval Office is situated. Until last July, Stamford had the best ecord in the state for finding jobs for Veterans. Then it was discovered that many of the job placements, for which the Federal Government provided funds, were actually the creation of an employee in the local office of the state Department of Labor who had a way with record‐keeping. By the time state and Federal investigators were through, blame for the creative record‐keeping went to Joseph J. Gorski, who the investigators said had routinely falsified reports by claithing credit for finding jobs for Veterans. Apparently the motive for the false record‐keeping, which Mr. Gorski admitted, was to boost the success rate of the local office. Mr. Gorski no longer works in the Stamford office of the Department of Labor. Last Monday he Stared work at the Bridgeport office Of ale Department of Labor. Mr. Gorski, who has worked for the department since March 1972, was dismissed on July 13 following the investigation, and Thomas Smith, the manager of the Stamford office, was demoted to supervisor because of failure to have checked up on the outstanding success of his office in job placements. While Mr. Smith did not contest his demotion, Mr. Gorski, through his union, the Connecticut Employees Union Independent, countered that his dismissal was excessive and that he was being made a “convenient victim” of administrative failings. Two weeks ago, to the chagrin of the Department of Labor, a state arbitrator ruled that a 30‐day suspension was sufficient punishment and ordered Mr. Gorski reinstated with $10,000 to $11,000 in back pay, minus the suspension. The arbitrator, Harry B. Purcell, held that since the employee “freely and promptly admitted to what he had done,” it was “a capricious act” for the state without warning, suddenly and unpredictably, to crack down with the maximum possible punishment. Mr. Gorski “did not understand that he was risking discharge by his handling of those placements in question,” said the arbitrator's report. “We find this very difficult to rationalize,” said C. Richard Ficks, spokesman for the Labor Department. “The decision in this case will have a far‐reaching impact on the Labor Department's ability to hold local office personnel accountable for administrative procedures that are defined by law and regulation,” Mr. Ficks said. Meanwhile, the state is sorting out the valid placements from the fictional ones in the Stamford office. Bridgeport, on the other hand, “runs a very tight ship,” according to Mr. Ficks. Anyone who has trouble deciding what he can afford to spend on himself should consider the $187,000 plight of the General Assembly, and take heart. The Democratic leadership apparently wants to double the expense allowance for representatives and senators from $1,000 for a two‐year term to $2,000. That change was in the legislative budget when the appropriations committee took up the question. Proponents said that the $1,000 expense limit had been in place for a decade, and that if the State of Connecticut would not pay for legislators’ gasoline, meals away from home and other expenses, eventually only the well‐to‐do could afford to hold office. Opponents called the change unconstitutional, citing a prohibition against lawmakers’ changing their compensation during their own terms of office. • The committee's debate followed its vote not to raise welfare benefits more than 5 percent, despite inflation of perhaps more than double that this year. Several committee members asked how the General Assembly could vote itself an increase to compensate for inflation while it denied the same benefit to the poor, and Representative Rufus Allyn of Mystic introduced an amendment to transfer a large part of the $187,000 to the Mystic Oral School, an institution for the deaf. Most amendments that day were crushed by large margins, but this one almost passed, with a vote of 21‐18. The political impact was not lost on the majority, however. The following week, with rumors of Republican plans to make the increase an issue on the floor of the House, the Democrats, after a caucus, voted overwhelmingly to kill it. And that was that, until the crescendo of the budget was past. Last week, the appropriations committee voted to let the increase go through, effective with the next session, which begins in 1981. • Republican leaders around the state favor building more nuclear power plants, according to a survey conducted by the G.O.P. members of the State Senate. The survey was mailed to members of the state central committee, town chairmen and vice chairmen, mayors, selectmen, and others, and reached most of them on the day that President Carter visited the stricken Three Mile Island plant near Harrisburg. Of the 250, or 38 percent, who responded, 60.2 percent favored expanding nuclear capacity, 28.6 percent wanted it kept at the same level, and 9.1 percent called for a reduction. Tax incentives for alternative energy sources, such as solar and wind power, were favored by 85.7 percent. A majority of 59.9 percent said they favored a ban on smoking “in virtually all public places, except for certain designated areas.” The Republicans also thought that the state had enough gambling facilities (66.7 percent) and that candidates for statewide offices, Congress, and the Legislature should be chosen by primaries (55.0 percent). They were split on the abortion issue. Only 6.9 percent said they would prohibit all abortions, but 34.1 percent said they would limit the reasons for abortions. Exctly half said they would permit all abortions, and the remaining 9.1 percent were undecided. One area of strong agreement was on whether the state “should have the authority to designate a regional solidwaste disposal area in any community provided it meets environmental standards.” The reply of 65 percent of the respondents was no. ■ The New York Times /Joseph Kugielsky Kristin N orling, a Westport official, and Jeff Meier of the town's police department demonstrate the ‘Denver Boot’"
Westport Looks Frankly At a Delicate Subject,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/06/archives/connecticut-weekly-westport-looks-frankly-at-a-delicate-subject.html,"THE scene is Staples High School, Westport, and the class is Human Sexuality, a new program in the human‐relations department. WESTPORT “Guys don't think virginity is such big deal as girls do….” “Society has raised us in such a way like you area virgin until you get married.” “Oh, that's changed in the last few years!” “Sure it's changed, but it's hind of implanted in your brain, if you were. raised that way….” “You really want to be with someone who understands what you're going’ through, who understands your feelings.” While most school systems in the state have been reluctant to institute sex‐education classes, Westport has exPanded its program. This semester an eighth‐grade program was added to the high‐school class that was started last year. Overall, however, public‐school sex education in the state is in limbo, according to Frank Caparulo, president of the Sex Information and Education Council of Connecticut. Mr. Caparulo said the school systems were steering away from the subject. “People are really afraid to do anything with it now, with the controversy over abortion,” he said. Existing programs are concentrated in Fairfield County, and elsewhere in the state attempts are few and fragmentary. On the other hand, there are some informal programs with “teachers testing the waters and teaching themselves,” he said. Judging by how quickly the council has grown to 200 members (mostly educators) in two years, Mr. Caparulo added, concern for sex education exists, but “the move to formal programs is extremely slow.” In the Westport High School class the students are engaged in a “fishbowl” exercise, with girls talking in the inner circle while boys listen in the outer circle. After a time the roles will be reversed. The topic for the day is virginity. From time to time, the instructors speak: “If you could give every guy in the world a set of directions, what would you want him to be aware of when he made love with a girl who was a virgin ‐the do's and don't's?” “Feelings, of course. When you think of it, a lot of guys are selfish sexually.” “You want tenderness. It doesn't matter if it's the back seat of a car or bed, but you want to be sure that you're not just a body.” “I wouldn't get that far if I didn't already know he understood my feelings.” “Why does it have to be special only the first time? What about other times?” Human Sexuality is now completing its second session. Initiated in January 1978 after a 10‐year effort to get sex education into the Westport schools, the half‐semester elective course is being held twice in succession this spring. It runs for nine weeks, four times a week, with a coeducational composition of about 25 sophomores, juniors and seniors. The program was approved last year by the Westport Board of Education with strong support from the ParentTeachers Association and little opposition. The board's chairman, Audrey Hansen, said that no objecting parents or other townspeople appeared at the board meeting, and that she had received no subsequent objections. Why has the town moved so painlessly into sex education? As Leonard Rovins, a board member, sees it, Westporters now view sex education as a necessity, given the rise of teen‐age pregnancies and the enormous increase in venereal diseases in Connecticut. “There's been so much publicity that people are finally aware of it,” he said. Ruth Kaufman and Robert Selverstone, who teach the class as a team, consider It unique for Connecticut. Al•hough a number of other Connecticut ocnool systems offer sex education, they incorporate it into biology, social studies, physical education or homeeconomics courses. Mrs. Kaufman and Dr. Selverstone said that as far as they knew, their Class was the only one acknowledged to be devoted entirely to sex education in a Connecticut public school. It is also, they said, the only complete such course, covering the entire range of sex‐related topics, including such subjects as homosexuality, masturbation, sexual development, conception and contraception. Moreover, Dr. Selverstone, said, the course is affective as well as cognitive. That is, it discusses values, feelings and human relations as well as the facts of life, and it takes a nonjudgmental position on values. The two teachers bring varied backgrounds to the course. Dr. Selverstone, with a Ph.D in educational psychology, headed the town's human‐relations program, where he brought parents and children together for discussions about drugs and other problems. He also teaches an adult course in human sexuality in Westport and at the University of Bridgeport. Mrs. Kaufman, a teacher of home economics and child development, has an undergraduate degree in child development and family relationships and a master's degree in education, and she has had further training in sex education. Both also teach value‐clarification courses in the high school — courses that have had an effect on the way they teach the sexuality course. and both say they work to make students comfortable with the topic and with each other. Early in the course, for example, the instructors focus on terminology, using lists of the dictionary words relating to sex. Students are told to add all synonyms — including street language and the words used in early childhood that occur to them. The exercise is intended to help students and teachers to communicate on several levels, using all types of vocabulary. “We explain that we all know three languages for sex — the dictionary terms, our parents’ euphemistic terms and the street language,” Mrs. Kaufman said, “and we talk about where each of those languages is appropriate.” “The first time it's important to make the whole experience good, like the first time for anything. What would you want to do it again for, if you had a really gross time? You want to be made love to, not ….” “Right.” “After you give it away the first time, you can't get it back and give it to somebody else. When it's gone, forget it.” “I think if it's the first time, it should be somebody special.” “What is this ‘giving'? It sounds so weird, so Victorian….” The purpose of the course, Dr. Selverstone said, is to develop responsible attitudes toward sex. “Another goal,” he said, “is to make students more aware of and accepting of individual differences in ideas and feelings and behavior. Sex education is a part of human‐relations education.” The teachers feel that the abortion unit has been especially effective. Students were exposed to all sides of the controversial issue — from a “Right to Life” film to a speaker from the Bridgeport abortion clinic. “We did that unit right after contraception,” Mrs. Kaufman said, “and later several girls told me that they would think very carefully, after seeing the abortion film, about what they're doing. I felt good about that, because that's part of my purpose, to make people take responsibility for their bodies.” Have goals the instructors hope for been achieved? “I learned that a lot of people have the same concerns and fears that I do, that I thought weretmique to me,” said Dan Cohan, a senior %Those father is George Cohan, the school's principal.. Christy Flood said: “It made me more open‐minded to other people's beliefs, and Bob and Ruth, the leaders, were really, really good. My sister is 15, in ninth grade, and I'd love to see her taking it right now.” Kevin Totoian said: “It woke me up to certain things about abortion, and it Made me think I had better be really Careful.” Dede Fitch, in the second class, views the course more critically, and expresses discomfort with the instant intimacy of the group process, which She sees as contrived and unnatural. She disliked the invitation, in the first session, to call instructors by first names, not the usual practice at Staples High School. “I didn't even know them, why should I call them by first names?” she asks. “I think the course encourages quick answers,” she said. “Some students think that because they've had a quarter course of human sexuality, they are able to go out and do anything. They are so sure about things and in such hurry. That's false security.” Nevertheless, she found the course valuable: “I've been able to define my own values in relation to every one else's. And I have new factual information, facts that I could get in the library but probably wouldn't.” While the classes drew on a crosssection of the school population, it was nevertheless a special group, the first to try out a new program. Students differed widely in sexual behavior. “There was a range,” said Di. Selverstone, “from those who have been having intercourse since eighth grade to others with no sexual experience whatever; and we really work on communication and the respect that each person deserves irrespective of values or attitudes or behavior.” Two‐thirds of the girls and one‐half the boys in the first class said in questionnaires that they were sexually experienced. With the second group of students, the instructors had made changes in the sequence of matetagl, using factual rather than “I feel” material as openers. “It gave them more of a chance to get to know each other in a less threatening atmosphere,” Dr. Selverstone said. are reservations, particularly on the issue of premarital sex and the nonjudgmental aspects of the course. “I little uncomfortable with get fact that there is no stand on premarital sex,” says Doris Shiller, a school board member, “but at least the kids are talking in a structured situation with adults. I think there's a tremendous need for sex education and it's long overdue.” Another school board member, Herbert Lobsenz, who cast the only vote against the program last spring, is resigned to the board's action, but continues to have his reservations. “I think sexual relations, by their very nature, must have some kind of ethical content,” he said, “and our sex‐education ourse at least purports to teach no sexual moral position. That in itself is takng a position.” Gail Kline, a P.T.A. member who worked on Dr. Selverstone's sex‐educaion committee in its early planning stages and who is the mother of six school‐age daughters, also ha’ concerns. “I don't feel much confidence in some people who are teaching the course, but that wouldn't keep me from letting my children take it,” she said. “That's true of all areas that the children are exposed to in school. I feel that, as a mother, I have to let them know my views, in opposition to other views, but I can't decide for them what they want to believe in as they grow older.” Dr. Stuart Bender, a Westport dermatologist who helped plan the program, also supports the program with reservations. “Where I part company with pro‐sex‐education people is the age at which it should be taught,” he said. “If taught at too early an age, it can provide too much stimulus and interfere with healthy maturation.” Meanwhile, most other systems in the state are not doing much about sex education, according to Joseph Townsley, a Westport school official. In his opinion, this is primarily because of lack of leadership. “There are competent, articulate teachers out there, but with no way to deliver a sex‐education program,” he said. “Administrators get in the way because it is too threatening.” Westport plans to expand its program next year. Mr. Townsley, who is Westport's K‐to‐9 curriculum coordinator, plans an eighth‐grade program for each junior high school. The Kaufman‐Selverstone program must be evaluated shortly in order to continue next year, and the outlook for continuation is good. “I feel that it is a very sound program,” said Audrey Hansen, the school board chairman. “It's not sex in itself, but the human‐relations aspect of • that's so important.” And Leonard Rovins of the board put his stamp of approval on the sex education program, concluding: “It doesn't belong on the street corners, and too often parents are negligent.

"School Press, With More Articles on Controversial Topics, Is Under Increasing Attack",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/06/archives/school-press-with-more-articles-on-controversial-topics-is-under-in.html,"WASHINGTON, May 5— “I don't think Mr. Rivadue would allow that,” said Kevin Cloherty, listening, impressed but dubious, to a speaker at the recent convention of the Columbia Scholastic Press Association. “That” was articles on drug abuse, sex, contraception and other controversial topics. John David Rivadue is adviser to Kevin and other members of the staff of The Rebound, the school newspaper at Garden City (N.Y.) Junior High. And even though the speaker, Michael D. Simpson of the Student Press Law Center in Washington, was assuring Kevin and hundreds of other students that their newspapers had the right to publish the articles, the adviser loomed large in his mind. Teachers and school administrators say the combination of interest and timidity expressed by Kevin, 19 years old, is typical among high school journalists. Student Victorious in Court Increasingly, as a result of court victories that include a major Supreme Court decision, student journalists are printing articles on controversial issues and finding themselves under attack by angry administrators and parents. Teachers and advisers who support such efforts sometimes find themselves out of jobs and administrators who attempt censorship sometimes find themselves in court. Checks in more than a dozen cities atound the country show that the issue of free speech in the high schools'is meeting with mixed results. Carolyn Rose, editor of the Viking Legend, a senior at Valley High School in Albuquerque, N.M., wrote an editorial in February 1978 summarizing birth control information available to teen‐agers. A five‐member committee of teachers and students voted to refuse permission to publish the editorial. Miss Rose, represented by her father, a lawyer, appealed the decision to school administrators, who ruled in her favor. The Guidon, the newspaper at El Modena High School in Orange, Calif., printed an article in 1977 about a Chicano student who had been indicted on a murder charge. The story described the difficulty of growing up as a member of a minority group in a “ghetto situation.” Angry Mexican‐American parents visited the principal, declaring that they did not live in a “ghetto” and demanding tetraction. The newspaper refused on the ground that the reporting was honest, but the teacher‐adviser, Hope Stewart, was removed from her post. Miss Stewart sued and, in an out‐of‐court settlement, was given another position. Wisconsin Parents Pleased At James Madison Memorial High School in Madison, Wis., student journalists on The Sword and Shield tackle such potentially controversial topics as child abuse, death, divorce, contraception and teen‐age pregnancy. Parents, for the most part, are pleased. At Stuyvesant High School in New York City, the staff of The Voice was planning a survey in November 1975 on such topics as homosexuality, abortion, and masturbation. The principal, ‘Caspar Fabricante, denied permission to circulate the questionnaire, and the staff appealed his decision. Eventually, the United States Court of Appeals upheld the principal on the ground that the questionnaire's probing of the sexual attitudes and habits might cause “significant psychological harm” to some students. Since then, the problems of school publications in the New York metropolitan area have generally arisen more from tight finances than censorship. “Most of our big problems with censorship occurred several years back,” said Sanford Gelernter, administrator for student affairs in the high school division of the Board of Education. “The big issues have been fought out already,” said Barry Lucas, adviser to the staff of The Clinton News at Bronx's DeWitt Clinton High School. But because of budget restraints, he said, the paper now has one‐tenth as much money as 10 years ago. It used to come out every week, but has published only once since last December, at a cost Mr. Lucas put at $200. ° It was the United States Supreme Court's 1969 decision in Tinker/v. Des Moines Independent School District that established public school students’ First Amendment rights. The Tinker case involved an attempt by school officials to prevent students from wearing black armbands to protest the Vietnam War. Rights Defined by Court Several Federal court cases have defined student press rights, generally permitting censorship only when it is found that publication would lead to “substantial physical disruption” at school, or in cases of obscenity or defamation. Despite the legal underpinnings of student press freedom, school officials are frequently prone either to ignore courtapproved standards or apply them in such a way as to censor papers. In California, the only state to have law bolstering student press freedom, Carol Hallenbeck, president of the Southern California Journalism Education Association, said that Proposition 13 and the tax cuts it brought had made school adMinistrators particularly sensitive to articles that might alienate voters. In urban school districts, many administrators seem to have reluctantly accepted publication of articles on sex, drug use and contraception. “Where they draw the line is when stories give bad publicity to the school, because that affects their ranking and, ultimately, their careers,” said Gerald Stone, adviser for 15 years to The Rampage at Coral Park Senior High School in Miami. Views of Administrators Some school administrators say that the courts have gone too far in extending First Amendment guarantees to students. Some argue that it is only “troublemakers” who want to publish controversial material. Others wonder who would be liable in court actions. Still others argue that courts are emphasizing rights without stressing responsibility. Censorship in the schools usually centers on such subjects as racism, student rights, social problems and criticism of school institutions or personnel. SometiMes one word will enrage a town. The staff of The Bronco Times at Union Grove High School in Union Grove, Wis., printed a letter to the editor in 1976 that complained about the restrooms being locked at lunchtime. The headline over the letter contained a pun on a slang word that the adviser, James Engman, suggested not be used because it was in bad taste. The students decided to print the headline anyway. Mr. Engman received a letter of discipline, and his teaching contract was not renewed. The school journalism class was eliminated, along with the paper. Mr. Engman is suing the school board. Hot Line in Wisconsin Similar incidents led to establishment in 1973 of the Journalism Education Hot Line in Sheboygan, Wis. Marion Anderson said she received’ about 10 calls month during the school year, with half the calls related to censorship and the rest to journalism curriculum problems. Mrs. Anderson said she referred censorship and other legal problems tothe Student Press Law Center in Washington. since 197,1, the center has acted as a national clearinghouse to collect, analyze and distribute information on the First Amendment rights of student journalists and on violations of those rights in high schools and colleges. The center also provides legal assistance to students and faculty advisers. At Garden City Junior High School, Mr. Rivadue, the newspaper adviser, said that his students had tackled many controversial issues, but that “there seems to be a return to more traditional beliefi and attitudes among the students. “We're writing an editorial on the draft now, and the students seem to be in favor of it,” he said. “The Vietnam War is so old to them it might as well be the War of 1812. They're more concerned with what they see as the United States being pushed around in the Middle East, losing face in Iran and Mexico.” The New York Times/George Tames Liza Najavits and David Danner, editors of the Student Press Law Center Report magazine, at work on the latest issue Friday in their Washington office."
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/07/archives/letters-a-grip-on-inflation-for-carter-proper-us-call-for-soviet.html,"To the Editor: The Administration's program to abate the continuing unchecked inflation has been met with but limited compliance. The longer this evil inflation continues, the more difficult will be the return to a stable economy. It is imperative that the President take action that will convince the people that our Government is dead earnest about the seriousness of our situation and will lead the nation in bold and practical action to bring about a positive and quick reduction in the spiraling prices of our inflated economy. In September of last year Dr. Arthur F. Burns, the wise and dedicated former chairman of the Federal Reserve, made the suggestion that “the President cut his own salary by 10 percent and call on all Presidential appointees and members of Congress to do likewise, and that the President reinforce this example for the nation by calling on top corporate executives to refrain from any increases in their compensation over the next two years.” Salaries and wages are a large part of the cost of producing most goods and services. If the savings resulting from a 10 percent cut were used to lower immediately the prices of products and services, a tremendous blow to the evil forces of inflation would have been struck. I am confident that the people, following the courageous leadership of their President, would support the many other steps in the battle to restore the economy of this great nation to a more stable basis, and thereby prevent the tragedy of a serious depression. Riverton, N.J., April 27, 1979 To the Editor: A letter by Ilya Levin taking issue with the decision of our Ambassador in Moscow, Malcolm Toon, to call on Soviet police when a man with a bomb entered the United States Embassy [April 10] warrants a reply. The Soviet citizen, Yu. M. Vlasenko, came to our embassy on March 28 with an explosive device strapped to his waist. He threatened to detonate the bomb unless the embassy obtained from the Soviet Government immediate permission for him to emigrate. If a Soviet citizen does not have permission from his or her Government to emigrate, the American Embassy in Moscow is powerless to act. The Department of State fully supports Ambassador Toon's actions in the Vlasenko incident. Under the circumstances, in which a Soviet citizen threatened to get off a bomb with risk to his own and American lives, there was no alternative to asking Soviet authorities to deal with the matter. In our diplomatic establishments around the world, we normally rely on the local police to deal with such situations. The Marine guards assigned to our embassies as security personnel are neither trained nor equipped to handle them. The Department of State and the embassy deeply regret Mr. Vlasenko's death, but are gratified that no one else, American or Soviet, was injured. By entering our crowded consular waiting room with a lethal deliiCe which apparently could have been triggered by simple movement of his finger, he endangered the lives of numerous innocent American and Soviet citizens. The American consular officers and Soviet officials, who sat calmly with him attempting to persuade him to disarm himself, risked their lives trying to save his. It is tragic that he refused to listen to reason, during a period of over six hours. Finally, it is misleading to draw parallel between this case, which occurred in our embassy in Moscow, and the Simas Kudirka case, which took place on a U.S. ship in U.S. territorial waters. Special Adviser to the Secretary of State on Soviet Affairs Washington, April 27, 1979 To the Editor: Your reaction to the Herbert case, our Supreme Court's latest assault upon the First Amendment, was predictable. Wicker was forthright, Baker satirical and Reston so busy balancing ramifications he did not decide anything. The Court's judgment was a disaster and portends the outcome of the prior‐restraint case being fought by The Progressive magazine. In true Orwellian doublethink, our Supreme Court will decide we must limit freedom in order to protect it — and it will all happen by 1984. Part of the problem is semantics. As Justice Stewart pointed out in dissent, the state of mind of the journalist is not the issue in libel suits. The consequence of that mind, the published product, tests the damage done the plaintiff. What we are really talking about is the soundness of journalistic behavior. Did he investigate enough? Did he jump to a conclusion he had no right to come to? The legal test is reasonableness under the circumstances, and, as Mr. Reston says, there are many who think that test is fair. Critics of the press point to the Sheppard case or other newsworthy crimes as illustrating journalism's lack of self‐restraint, but these offenses, more likely than not, are attributable to an editor's perception of his audience as gossipmongers interested in gory details. More relevant is the Supreme Court's perception of journalists as malicious cynics getting kicks from revealing the foibles of their betters, but the fact is that of the millions of articles published few result in libel suits because the journalistic shot generally comes close to the mark. The difficulty is that we, the press included, live in a time of institutional disintegration. Vietnam destroyed the Government's credibility and, If we managed to forget that lesson, the disaster at Three Mile Island proved among other things that honesty in public relations remains beyond many officials. Since there is a tendency to hold the messenger responsible for the news he brings, the press, reporting the inconsistencies, incompetence and foolishness of authorities, must bear the brunt of its bad tidings. If one were to compare the social benefit of a fearless press publishing without threat of libel suit (the late, lamented — by me — Justice Black believed the First Amendment prohibits libel suits) with a Colonel Herbert deprived of legal redress for what he believes defamatory, the free, unfettered press is clearly more important. It will be until libel becomes the journalistic rule, and if journalists believe their efforts should be held to some ambiguous, post hoc legal standard, they admit too much. The media are trustworthy, and if they have been wrong, their error was more a result of limitations on the way news is gathered than an intent to do injury. Reporters cannot subpoena nor can they search by warrant. Instead, they regularly face officials interested in withholding the truth, and all the Supreme Court does is make a difficult job less possible. But the media can expose the Supreme Court for the collection of fallible individuals it is. Television showed us the retreating back of the Chief Justice as he fled from an interviewer. The Chief Justice said he didn't do television interviews, and no one quarrels with his self‐imposed exile from the rest of us. We have forgotten Harry Truman's advice that if you can't stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen. If judges are to resolve the minutia of our lives, decide about affirmative action, school busing and abortions, perhaps they should climb down from their ivory tower and let us know what is on their minds. It may well be we will decide they should not sit for the rest of their lives but only until they get too far ahead of the rest of us. The upshot of all this is a constitutional convention, and if that convention opens the system to unfortunate change, blame must be placed on those who have gone too far. Bridgeport, Conn., April 23, 1979 To the Editor: Recent statements in the press have suggested that radioactive iodine (1311) entering the body even in very small quantities may cause thyroid cancer. Since this radioactive isotope has been widely used in medical practice for more than 30 years for well‐accepted, standard and important procedures, such allegations have caused unnecessary concern. There is no evidence to suggest that the amounts of radioactive iodine used for the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid disease have resulted in an increase in thyroid cancer. These quantities have varied from 5 to 200 microcuries for diagnostic purposes and from 2,000 to over 10,000 microcuries for therapy. The data from the Harrisburg incident suggest that a maximum of 90 picocuries (a picocurie is one‐millionth of a microcurie) of 131‐1 was found per liter of milk. Clearly, even under the worst possible circumstances, the amount of radioactive iodine that could be accumulated by the thyroid gland from this amount of environmental contamination would be one‐millionth that accumulated by the thyroid in the course of diagnostic procedures which have not been shown to cause deleterious effects. In fact, actual measurements of the thyroid glands of individuals living in the Harrisburg area have failed to show any increased accumulation of radioactive iodine since the incident. Director, Div. of Nuclear Medicine N.Y. Hospital‐Cornell Medical Center New York, Apri123, 1979 To the Editor: It would seem that if the politicians in Washington who are denouncing the oil barons so vehemently could run our country with half the skill and efficiency that oil company executives are demonstrating in the conduct of their businesses, we'd be a nation of very happy, prosperous, contented people. Montclair, N.J., April 29, 1979 To the Editor: Relatively few Americans apparently realize what is happening in the Congress in regard to financial support of the United Nations, and it has taken Secretary General Kurt Waldheim to call attention to the destructive results to the entire U.N. technical program if the restrictive measures of the Helms Amendment remain as United States policy. “The implications involved here are so far‐reaching,” said Mr. Waldheim, “that I believe it my obligation to point out that they could undermine the very foundations of the entire United Nations system.” This amendment bars the Government from paying that part of the assessment allocated for technical assistance to such agencies as the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization. The amendment, under the strict interpretation of the U.N. Charter, could cause the United States to lose its vote in such agencies if it continues to default. It has already defaulted on its February payment. On March 17, 1977, President Carter, at U.N. headquarters, declared: “I have come to express my own support and the continuing support of my country for the ideals of the United Nations.” On Oct. 5, 1977 he signed the’ two human rights covenants and asked for their ratification. Moreover, at the conclusion of the Camp David Summit, Mr. Carter said that “these negotiations will be based on all provisions and all the principles of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 242.” These and many other indications prove how essential the U.N. is to our policy in regard to human rights and world peace. Now it is the Senate's turn to vote the repeal of the Helms Amendment and thus return our Government to its riehtful financial responsibility to the United Nations. Wyckoff, N.J., April 24, 1979 To the Editor: This morning's paper tells of price increases that carry the current inflation rate to 13 percent annually. It carries also Alfred Kahn's statement that nothing can, or indeed should, be done about it — once more that tedious drug metaphor of “no quick fix.” It prints also the prediction of Barry Bosworth of the Council on Wage and Price Stability that the inflation will shortly get worse. Worse means a new weakening of the dollar abroad, more suffering for those who placed their trust in this frivolous currency for their old age or who do not share the better fortune of those who by directly enhancing their prices and income help cause the inflation or those whose increased profits result from inflation. But my concern is different. It is to inquire why in the world we need economists in these circumstances? My colleagues cannot possibly believe that they are required only to tell us that things are getting worse and that nothing can be done. Are my friends so without professional pride that they have no sense of what it is to fail? Cambridge, Mass., April 27, 1979"
"CHILEANS, IN CHANGE, OPPOSE BIRTH CURBS",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/07/archives/chileans-in-change-oppose-birth-curbs-a-steady-decline-in-the-birth.html,"SANTIAGO, Chile, May 6 — A steady decline in Chile's birth rate during the last five years of economic hardship has resulted in a campaign against birth control. “Back to maternity,” said the newspaper El Mercurio in a headline on an article reporting a change in official policy on family planning designed to promote population growth. Chile was a pioneer in officially supported family planning programs, which were introduced in 1965 under the Christian Democratic Government of President Eduardo Frei Montalva. The Ministry of Health recently published figures showing that the birth rate remained at about 28 for each thousand people between 1969 and 1973, but declined sharply after that to 21.6 a thousand last year. The decline coincides with the military regime of President Augusto Pinochet, which took power in September 1973. The austerity measures imposed since then have severely reduced the income of workers, maintained unemployment at over 15 percent and sent many Chileans abroad in search of jobs. Marriage and Children Postponed As a result, population experts say, many couples postponed marriage and many families put off having children. The effect, despite a reduction in the death rate from 8.4 per thousand in 1973 to 6.8 last year, has been to slow down the population increase from 2 percent a year in 1969 to 1.5 percent last year. This is one of the lowest rates in Latin America, comparable only to those of Argentina and Uruguay. The National Planning Office, in a policy paper called “Population and Culture,” said last month that a “significant increase in population” was desirable. The population at the end of last year was estimated at 10,857,000; some would like to see it increased to 20 million. The argument for stimulating a higher birth rate is that “national security” is endangered if Chile falls behind its larger neighbors in population, and that the economy will. be limited without faster population growth. Conservative Roman Catholic groups, which have been opposed to the family planning program, have joined the attack by the.planning board, which said the official health services should “reject all pressures for demographic intervention.” DoctorsAttack Birth Control “The indiscriminate use of contraceptives has been accompanied by sexual promiscuity, organic sicknesses, and dissolution of family ties,” said Dr. Patricio Mena, a gynecologist, as reported by El Mercurio. “The genetic alterations and malformations produced by contraception border on genocide,” Dr. Ricardo Cruz Coke, a medical statistician, was quoted as having said. But the campaign is regarded by many physicians as unlikely to have a powerful effect on population trends as long as the income and employment level of workers remain unchanged. “The adoption of a policy of providing contraceptives, primarily intrauterine devices, and information to women through the National Health Service,” said Dr. Fernando Monckeberg, a leader in child nutrition programs, “was based on the high number of abortions in Chile before family planning became widely available. We are not going to'go back to abortions.” The National Health Service, with 360 hospitals and 1,600 clinics throughout Chile, is providing family planning serv, ices to an estimated 70 percent of women of childbearing age, according to medical sources. “The right of parents to decide on the number of children they want,” said Dr. Guillermo Adriazola, president of the National Family Protective Association, an affiliate of the International Planned Parenthood Federation, “is not possible for persons of low economic and cultural level without subsidized programs of contraceptive materials and information.” Dr. Adriazola said he had no quarrel with expanding the population to 20 million, but he said the choice of family size should be decided freely, without depriving the poor of the means to limit the number of children they want."
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/09/archives/letters-reducing-jury-selection-to-a-lottery-calvin-coolidge-as-mr.html,"Reducing Jury Selection to a ‘Lottery’ To the Editor: On April 23, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit offered tacit approval, authorization and legitimacy to a suspension of Sixth Amendment rights to a fair trial by jury of one's peers in a decision affirming the convictions and sentencing of Leroy “Nicky” Barnes and ten other defendants. The core of the decision written by Judge Leonard P. Moore with Judge Peter VanGraafeiland concurring justified the use of an “anonymous jury” in a trial such as this involving all black and Hispanic defendants charged in a drug conspiracy indictment. A separate dissenting opinion was written by Judge Thomas Meskill in which he stated, “I am troubled by the implications of today's decision and the uses to which it may be put.” I, too, am troubled by the implications of that decision. Judge Meskill displayed keen judicial insight and courage in balking at the majority opinion. He recognized prejudice inherent in a trial procedure which denies defendants the names, addresses, ethnic and religious backgrounds of the jurors sitting in judgment of them. In fact, the trial judge additionally denied the defendants any inquiry into the neighborhood of the jurors. The obvious racial connotations emerge from this acute ruling. No mention was made by any of the circuit judges of the special attention given to the case by President Carter or the significance of such attention on a trial judge's discretion. However, the stumbling stampede by the state and Federal law enforcement officials to snare and imprison the notorious “Mr. Untouchable” has been no well kept secret. The implications of an unfair trial abound. The jury selection process is geared toward affording defendants some say in who is considered a peer. The process allows the defendant to make relevent inquiry of each prospective juror in order to garner some facts for making a decision, subjective or objective, concerning the jurors he will select to render his verdict. The jury selection process is difficult, as most attorneys will agree, and the difficulty is only slightly diminished when even the most searching questions are put to the jurors. To arbitrarily deny relevent information is to disarm the defendant in his quest for an impartial jury. It is then reduced to lottery. Abuses are certain to follow time‐honored traditions are relaxed in “special cases” and left to the discretion of trial judges who may be affected by any of the choices among race, creed, color or political affiliation. Questions follow: Will anonymous jurors be allowed to cover their faces? Will they be permitted to sit behind mirrors or partitions? Will the press be excluded where the right of juror privacy is weighed against freedom of the press? If a juror has a right to privacy, does it outweigh the defendant's right to a fair trial by a juror of his peers? Suggestions for the future are anonymous complainants, anonymous iudees. and finally anonymous defend ants. HAROLD BRISCO New York, May 3,1979 Calvin Coolidge as Mr. Carter's Mentor To the Editor: Although William Safire said, in his column of April 26, that he did not mean to “put down” Calvin Coolidge, it was unjust of him to say that Coolidge and Jimmy Carter “have much in common.” In fact, they have little in common. President Coolidge was a man of deep insight, brilliant speech and effective leadership. A few examples will remind those who have forgotten, or who are too young to have known. Coolidge's fundamental understanding of the American political system was shown by the reply he gave to the statement that there are lots of sons of bitches in the Congress. He pointed out, trenchantly, “Well, there's a lot of them in the country, and they have to be represented.” Similarly, his grasp of the American economic system was revealed by his famous epigram, “The business of America is business.” He also went to the heart of one of our most baffling economic problems when he said that when people were out of work there is unemployment. Probably the most difficult international economic problem of his time was whether the United States should press its World War I allies to repay their war debts to us. He cut through all the complexities by saying, “They hired the money, didn't they.” These and similar utterances of Coolidge will live forever, but the only remark of Mr. Carter that has survived for more than a few days is something about Montezuma's revenge. Coolidge took office after a period of great political corruption, but there was no Lancegate, no Peanutgate, not even a maple syrupgate, during his Administration. He found the price level stable when he came into office, and it was stable when he left. Coolidge kept the Federal budget in balance while he was in office, whereas Mr. Carter only promises to balance mailana. Mr. Carter could learn a great deal from studying Mr. Coolidge. He might even try out Coolidge's famous declaration, “I do not choose to run.” HERBERT STEIN Washington, April 30, 1979 The writer was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, 1971‐74. Legislative Prerogatives on Medicaid Abortions To the Editor: In response to your recent editorial concerning the “Anti‐Abortion Ploy” in Albany, I suggest that a ploy becomes a ploy only when your opponent uses it. Assuming that democracy still exists in the State Legislature, no senator or assemblyman is bound to support the report of the fiscal committees, which constitutes the budget for the houses. Each year in Albany, both houses of the Legislature receive and debate a variety of proposed amendments to the state budget that have been introduced by legislators exercising their right. The amendments are all intro‐. duced close to the April 1 budget deadline. Rarely do these amendments pass. Indeed, when the amendment to delete Medicaid abortion funding passed the Senate in 1978, no one could remember the last time a budget amendment had succeeded. The 1978 budget debate on Medicaid abortions was the first that could have been held on the subject, the U.S. Supreme Court having made Medicaid abortion funding optional in 1977. In 1978 and in 1979, the Assembly and the Senate each passed different budgets. The Assembly elected to fund the killing of the unborn; the Senate did not. Neither side would budge. But it was the Senate engaging in the “ploy,” or an “unusual tactic.” Before the 1977 decision, the high court ruled that all women have legal rights to abortion. You may continue to characterize this as a “hard‐won legal right of poor women” if you wish. However, those of us who disdain your lachrymal approach to budgets will continue to believe that it is better to delete tax dollars for abortion than to delete the numbers of the noon JAMES H. DONOVAN State Senator, 46th District Albany, April 18, 1979 Fuel‐Saving Air To the Editor: While we recognize that the proper inflation of automobile tires is far more important in determining fuel economy than the 55‐miles‐per‐hour speed limit, it is increasingly frustrating to find a growing number of service stations which no longer provide “air” for the convenience of their customers. One would think that the oil companies would choose to use a small portion of their enormous profits to provide air at each station as a gesture of goodwill, or that otherwise the Government would require such services in the interest of fuel conservation. HARRY P. SCHMIDT Manhasset, L.I., April 24,1979 What P.A.'s Do To the Editor: In a recent article dealing with an “imposter” doctor, an assistant district attorney in Philadelphia described “physician's assistant” as position “for which there are no qualifications.” The title “physician's assistant” is recognized in almost every state, with stringent regulations from boards of medical examiners as to who may be registered with that title. In the article the title was evidently used to describe someone who does routine tasks for doctor; such an individual, whose training and qualifications are minimal, is called a medical assistant. A physician's assistant is a graduate of an American Medical Associationapproved training program, usually two intensive years of preparation. P.A.'s take medical histories, perform physical examinations, order and interpret laboratory tests and often manage cases alone, prescribing medication and conferring with supervising physicians when necessary. STEVEN TIGER Clinical Instructor, P.A. Program Long Island University / BrooklynCumberland Medical Center Brooklyn, April 23, 1979 Our Country's Vast and Unthreatened Wilderness To the Editor: Your April 25 editorial “Opening Too Much Wilderness” implies in its first pragraph that U.S. Forest Service lands which were historically dedicated to wilderness are now to be diverted to multiple use and to development. Of course, the exact opposite is the case. It would have been more accurate to report that the U.S. Forest Service, in its response to a requirement in a 1964 Congressional act, has reviewed the characteristics of the remaining 62 million acres of roadless nonwilderness it manages and has recommended that 15 million acres of this land be set aside for roadless wilderness. Fifteen million acres, an area approximately the size of West Virginia, is not a “minor portion,” to use the language of the editorial, of the remaining nonwilderness of the Forest Service system. It would double the Forest Service‐managed wilderness. The editorial also implies that only 62 million acres of potential wilderness remain in this country. A fairer statement of the actual case would have pointed out that the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the Department of Defense and other agencies also manage huge tracts of Federal land, and that wilderness areas may be designated in those lands as well. The Bureau of Land Management's own wilderness assessment program, the proposed Alaskan legislation and recent executive action of the President in creating wilderness under the Antiquities Act could result in total new withdrawals of Federal lands from multiple use of as much as 520 million acres. The context also requires an explanation that current withdrawals of Federal lands from mineral entry include an area equal to that part of the United States east of line drawn from St. Louis to the Canadian border and north of a line drawn from St. Louis to the Atlantic. All this land is being set aside for nonuse at a time when public interest in the maintenance of single‐use wilderness, which appears to have been a fad of some three or four years’ duration, is evaporating. Entry into wilderness areas last year totaled only seven million man‐days, a fraction of the entry by Americans into national parks and onto other types of Federal land. Sporting‐equipment manufacturers report that sales of tents, sleeping bags and other equipment used by hikers for treks into the wilderness are decreasing. It is not true that all use of land results in permanent loss of wilderness characteristics. Most exploration for mineral deposits, for an example, fails. All signs of preliminary exploration are usually obliterated by new growth in a very short time. Even clearcut log areas reforestrate, and wilderness groups now suggest that many reforested areas are in fact wilderness and should be so designated. Finally, the editorial seems to suggest that if, as a result of over-allocation of land to wilderness, shortages of natural resource materials become critical, areas can be returned to multiple use, and natural resources will immediately be obtainable from them. Of course, this is not the case. Lead time from actual exploration and discovery of a natural resource to actual production from the discovered mine or oil field is rarely less than five years and often as much as 20 years. It is simply not true that metal or petroleum will immediately be forthcoming from redesignated Federal lands, if in fact they are ever reopened for explo- ration. R. L. BROWN Chatham Twp., N.J., April 27, 1979"
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/10/archives/letters-newfound-brutality-in-iran.html,"To the Editor: For 25 years the Shah of Iran tortured and murdered many thousands of dissident workers, students, peasants and intellectuals. For the most part, the U.S. press ignored these dreadful happenings and portrayed the Shah as a citadel of stability and an enlightened modernizer. Thousands more were killed by the Shah's police and military during the popular uprisings of this past year. Yet these casualties received only passing mention, even though Iran was front‐page news for several months. And from 1953 to 1978 millions of other Iranians suffered the silent oppression of poverty and malnutrition while the Shah, his family and his generals grew ever richer. Now the furies of revolution have lashed back, thus far executing about 200 of the Shah's henchmen — less than what the Savak would arrest and torture on a slow weekend. And now the U.S. press has suddenly become acutely concerned, keeping a careful count of the “victims,” printing photos of firing squards and making repeated references to the “revulsion” and “outrage” felt by anonymous “middle‐class” Iranians who apparently are endowed with finer sensibilities than the mass of ordinary people who bore the brunt of the Shah's repression. At the same time, American commentators are quick to observe that the new regime is merely replacing the one repression with another. So it has always been with the recording of revolutions: the mass of nameless innocents victimized by the ancien regime go uncounted and unnoticed, but when the not‐so‐innocent murderers are brought to revolutionary justice, the business‐owned press is suddenly filled with references to “brutality” and “cruelty.” That anyone could equate the horrors of the Shah's regime with the ferment, change and struggle that is going on in Iran today is a tribute to the biases of the U.S. press, a press that has learned to treat the atrocities of U.S.-supported right‐wing regimes with benign neglect while casting a stern, selfrighteous eye on the popular revolutions that challenge such regimes. MICHAEL PARENTI Visiting Fellow, Institute for Policy Studies Washington, May 8, 1979 When a Tree House Is Not a Tree House To the Editor: In the editorial “Out on a Limb” (April 26), The Times proves once again that its eye, too, is on the sparrow. But in this case the eye is glass. Alexa Grace The “tree house” you cite is not even tree house at all, if you define a tree house as a house built in a tree, generally on a platform nestling among the branches. The structure in question is, in fact, a cabin on eight‐foot stilts set within the ground. It rises another eight feet above the platform, which measures 8 x 12 feet. The building itself is approximately 750 cubic feet. It consists of a porch, four windows, a skylight, a pitched and shingled roof and a hinged door. It was built by carpenters according to plans, not by small boys doing a Tom Sawyer bit. Moreover, contains full‐sized furniture, including several chairs, a table and bedding for four people. But this structure was not — as you state — condemned because it is presumably dangerous to children but because it is an illegal structure in terms of what it is, where it is, how big it is and what it does to the neighborhood. It is visible from within the house as well as from the grounds of numerous neighbors — all of whom have children of their own and all of whom object to the structure as an eyesore. It bears about the same relationship to a real tree house as Levit-town to Thoreau's cahin. DON FRIFIELD Ridgefield, N.J., May 1, 1979 To the Editor: Your editorial on April 26, Out on a Limb,” was very good. I'm with your stand all the way. I'm also very glad that you put in something worthwhile for a child to read. A tree house is a child's toy and shouldn't be taken away. You were right about everything in your editorial. I don't think that you really need a nermit to build a tree house. NIKKI FLORA Maplewood, N.J., April 26, 1979 Hospital Quandary To the Editor: Messrs. Lynaugh and Goldner are right on target in their April 26 letter, noting that the Federal Government reaps the lion's share of any cost savings the city or state governments are able to achieve through hospital cost reimbursement strategies. In a report for the Temporary Commission on City Finances, I estimated that the closure of 5,000 hospital beds, half in municipal and half in voluntary hospitals, would save $234 million a year. However, the city would realize only $30 million. The balance would accrue, under present Medicaid reimbursement formulas, to the Federal and state governments. Unless these governments offer the city a more favorable arrangement, the political and social price of bed closings may be too great for the city to RICHARD W. NATHAN Los Angeles, May 3, 1979 Fairness in Education To the Editor: Timothy Mitchell's April 25 letter misinterprets the Levittown court decision. The court, in effect, ruled that lack of local tax wealth should not deprive children in poor school districts of the same educational opportunities as children in wealthier districts. The same principle of fairness applies to the constitutional right to an abortion. Had the courts ruled as Mr. Mitchell suggests, people without children would be exempt from that part of the real estate tax that goes to schools, and people who don't use libraries, parks, public transportation and other municipal facilities would be exempt frnm taxes that subsidize them. ROSALYN UDOW Great Neck, LI., April 25, 1979 The writer is former president of the Board of Education of Union Free School District 7. A Raise for ‘Nonessential’ City Council Aides? To the Editor: According to a news report, a spokesman for the aides to the City councilmen stated that they are going to lobby their employers for an increase in the allocation for the group from the present $20,000 annually for each councilman to $35,000. This has to win the “Chutzpah of the Year” award. If enacted, it would cost the taxpayers an additional $645,000 year. At a time in our city's history when next year's proposed budget calls for so many cuts in essential services, how can anyone seriously ask for an increase for what is probably the most nonessential group on the city's payroll, the City Council Just‐three or four years ago their total budget was $7,500 per council member. Unnoticed by the public, the figure was first doubled and last year, again without fanfare, increased to $20,000. What is a council aide? What do they do, and how are they appointed? As a former Democratic district leader in the 84th Assembly District can tell you first‐hand. Although I am sure that some councilmen do use their aides exclusively for council business, most are “noshow” or “seldom show” appointments to party workers as a reward for their services. These are part‐time jobs, but most aides are paid at least the necessary minimum required to make them eligible to receive all of the The Times welcomes letters from readers. Letters for publication most include the writer's name, address and telephone number. Because of the large volume of mail received, we regret that we arc unable to at knowledge.or to return unpublished letters. many fringe benefits, another costly item. They are expected to work for the political clubs and their candidates prior to primary and general elections, and many are recruited for duty at the Board of Elections when there are petition challenges. There are many instances where they have been known to do private legal work for their councilman, if he happens to be lawyer. Last year, after unsuccessfully attempting to raise their own salaries, the City councilmen voted to increase their expense allowance by a whopping $11,500 per member. However, was stipulated that none of this money could be used for their aides. Each year the cost of running the City Council seems to increase one way or another. This latest attempt to fleece the public once again is an abomination. ELEANOR CHAIFETZ Bronx, April 30,1979 ‘Unhelpful’ Support For Israeli Policies To the Editor: Bernice Tannenbaum's outrage against the P.L.O. (letter April 29) is understandable. Who among us was not moved when reading an account of a father and his little girl being murdered in cold blood? But surely Bernice Tannenbaum must know that Israel, in its repeated retaliations, has killed many a father and daughter. If she doesn't know this, it is the fault of the media, as well as her imagination. The results of P.L.O. terrorism are individuated for us by dramatic firsthand accounts on the front pages of our newspapers, whereas the casualties due to Israeli bombs and shells are merely statistics. Then why, one might ask, does the P.L.O. continue its attacks? The answer to this question is ignored by too many Jews. It is because the war between the Palestinians and the Israelis has never ended. Even after the signing of a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, the fate of the Palestinians is as dark and uncertain as it has been for the past three decades. In all fairness — and I do not ask this question easily — why should they lay down their arms? When the British shoe was the other Israeli foot, did Israel? I suggest that at this point in its history, Israel is incapable of responding to peace with the same magnificent daring and imagination with which it responds to war and other crisis. I suggest that it is precisely here that the almost Pavlovian allegiance on the part of American Jewish organizations (of which Hadassah is one) — the kind of unquestioning endorsement these organizations have accorded Israel in its policies — has been most unhelpful. All they have succeeded in accomplishing so far has been the reinforcement of the hawks and the self-righteous at the expense of the doves and the peacemakers. Perhaps if Bernice Tannenbaum brought this to the attention of her organization, she would do more to alleviate the suffering of innoIsraeli victims than propaganda pleas. DAVID GOLDMAN New York, April 30, 1979 Beef and Confidence To the Editor: Your April 19 editorial “Keep the Beef Boycott Within Bounds” made an impressive and important point. Your clear, perceptive explanation of such an extremely complex agricultural issue as beef prices and the cattle cycle was a valuable service to both. cattle producers and consumers. U.S. cattlemen now appear to be holding a large number of female cattle on their farms and ranches. If cattlemen remain confident that prices will remain profitable, many of these animals will probably go into breeding herds, and the process of rebuilding beef supplies will accelerate. If confidence falters, however, many of these heifers could go directly to market or into feedlots, delaying herd rebuilding and prolonging the period of tight beef supplies and high consumer prices. BOB BERGLAND Secretary of Agriculture Washington, April 26, 1979 Soviet SALT Hurdle To the Editor: The key word in the SALT negotiations is “equality.” Since there are many different weapons systems, they are complicated to equate. But the fact remains that after decades of superiority we are settling for equality. Equality, except for one absolutely vital matter, namely verification. If there is to be equality in all other matters, why not in verification? In one fell swoop, the Soviets could assure Senate passage of the treaty, have all the détente they want and swing world opinion. All they have to do is to permit inspection — inspection equal to what we permit them. I do not call for inspection of anything but matters covered by treaty commitments. They can inspect and verify us; we should be able to inspect and verify them. Why else would the men in the Kremlin deny us the same verification rights that we give them, why else than that they plan to cheat? WILLIAM T. RHAME San Antonio, April 26, 1979 View From the Subway To the Editor: “Subway Grime Yielding to Paint” says the headline — bravo! But what good is a glowing station name if you cannot see it? The windows of the cars are still grimy and virtually opaque. Or worse — painted over by vandals. When is the city finally going to clamp down on this disgrace? H. PACHTER New York, May 3, 1979"
Uncharitable Rivalry Among Charities,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/12/archives/uncharitable-rivalry-among-charities.html,"As inflation shrinks the charity dollar, the competition is heating up — and the giant United Way has been playing too rough. Bad enough that it has been unresponsive to newer, non‐traditional causes like neighborhood associations; it has also tried to blackball their efforts to raise money from corporations. The United Way is a valuable instrument of philanthropy and deserves continued support. But it should direct some of its energies toward new needs, rather than thwart those already working to meet them. • The 2,300 chapters of the United Way around the country dispense $1 billion annually to 39,800 social welfare agencies, like the Salvation Army, Red Cross and YWCA. Consolidated fund‐raising has many benefits. Donors prefer the convenience of one‐stop giving and payroll deductions. The time‐consuming and unpleasant chore of choosing among hopeful solicitors is left to boards representing the community of both givers and receivers. A combined appeal also yields more: it is easier to shame fellow workers into giving once to a proven cause than repeatedly to innumerable ones. None of that, however, is much consolation to worthy groups for which the United Way has no room. These causes range from legal services for the poor to halfway houses for troubled youngsters. Donations to the United Way have scarcely kept pace with inflation. It can barely meet the growing financial needs of its long‐standing grantees, much less extend help to new ones. That is regrettable but understandable. What is unseemly, however, is how a number of United Way chapters have tried to prevent outside groups from getting companies to establish payroll deduction plans for their benefit. A number of local chapter officials have even lobbied employers to ignore the newer causes. These newer charities have a hard enough time in the first place. Contributors are not likely to be as generous to environmentalists, say, or abortion clinics, as they are to established, noncontroversial recipients like the Boy Scouts. Threatened now by legal action, some United Way chapters have backed off and let their competitors appeal for corporate and union support. All chapters would be well-advised to follow suit. There remains an important task for those concerned that the United Way has lost sight of contemporary problems: make it more responsive. Its boards and committees can more clearly reflect the diversity of needs in their communities and can call on traditional agencies to address them, to prove afresh that the United Way is still the better way."
"COURT, 6‐3, TIGHTENS BAN ON SEX BARRIER IN EDUCATION LAW",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/15/archives/court-63-tightens-ban-on-sex-barrier-in-education-law-women-and.html,"WASHINGTON, May 14 — The Supreme Court significantly strengthened the Federal law that bars sex discrimination in education today by ruling that the law gives individuals the right to bring sex discrimination suits against schools and colleges. The 6‐to‐3 decision was hailed by women's rights leaders as an important victory. It also pleased the Carter Administration, which had urged the Justices to reverse a Federal appeals court ruling that only the Federal Government, not individual victims of sex discrimination, could seek to enforce the provisions of the law, known as Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. The Department of Justice brief warned that the lower court interpretation will pose a serious obstacle to the effective enforcement” of the law because, the department said, the Government lacks the resources to respond to every sex discrimination complaint. Nurse Seeking to Be Doctor Today's decision, Cannon v. University of Chicago (No. 77‐926), will allow Geraldine Cannon, a nurse who was denied admission to the medical schools of the University of Chicago and Northwestern University, to proceed with her Title IX suit against those institutions. She is asking the courts to order her admission to medical school and to award compensatory damages. Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex by educational intitutions that receive Federal funds. The only enforcement mechanism . specifically set out in the law is a cumbersome administrative procedure, which has never been used successfully. Its culmination is a cutoff of Federal funds to the institution by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Title IX is also the basis for suits such as those charging that women's athletic programs have not been financed on an equal basis with men's facilities and programs. These suits, however, have not raised the jurisdictional problem presented by Mrs. Cannon's case, because the schools involved have been public institutions, and other Federal laws give in‐ dividuals an undisputed right to bring private lawsuits where state action is involved. The United States District Court in Chicago threw Mrs. Cannon's suit out on the ground that the administrative remedy was the only one the law allowed. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed, refusing to infer from the law's silence on the matter a private right to sue on the part of individual victims of dicriminaion. In reversing those decisions, the majority opinion today by Associate Justice John Paul Stevens concluded that “not only the words and history of Title IX, but also its subject matter and undérlying purposes” all led to the conclusion that Congress intended to allow individual lawsuits. Justice Stevens said that the law's one explicit remedy, the cutoff of Federal funds to an entire institution, is so severe as not to be useful to a woman with an individual complaint. Unfair Burden Found “It makes little sense to impose on an individual, whose only interest is in obtaining a benefit. for herself, or on H.E.W., the burden of demonstrating that an institution's practices are so pervasively discriminatory that a complete cutoff of Federal funding is appropriate,” Justice Stevens wrote. He continued: “The award of individual relief to a private litigant who has prosecuted her own suit is not only sensible but is fully, consistent with — and in some cases even necessary to — the orderly enforcement of the statute.” Mrs. Cannon is an experienced surgical nurse who was 39 years old when she applied to the two medical schools four years ago. Both schools had policies against admitting applicants over the age of 30. A central part of her argument is that these policies themselves discriminate against women because women interrupt their education and experience delays in their careers more often than men do. The opinion is significant beyond the sex discrimination area. Many of the other important Federal antidiscrimination laws are also silent on the right of individual victims to bring lawsuits. The right of an individual to sue under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits educational institutions from discriminating on the basis of race, was at issue in last year's Bakke case, for example. The Court found in favor of Alan P. Bakke, ordering him admitted to a University of California Medical School. The Court, in a complex decision, acted under the assumption that Mr. Bakke had the right to sue but did not rule on that issue as a matter of law. However, the private right to sue under Title VI forms such a central assumption in today's analysis of Title IX that in future race discrimination suits it is not even likely to be regarded as an open question. It is a fresh development insofar as in the interpretation of Federal laws not involving discrimination — securities laws, for example — the Supreme Court recently has been extremely reluctant to infer private rights of action. Just last month, the Court ruled that companies could not bring private lawsuits under the Freedom of Information Act to compel Federal agencies to withhold confidential business data from public disclosure. The universities involved in today's suit had argued that a finding by the Supreme Court of a private right to sue would “subject the admissions dec`:ions of unversities to judicial scrutiny at the behest of a disappointed applicant on a case‐by‐case basis.” Justice Stevens rejected that argument, holding that Congress had already considered and rejected it when drafting the legislation. The majority opinion was joined by Associate Justices William J. Brennan Jr., Potter Stewart, Thurgood Marshall and William H. Rehnquist. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger concurred in the judgment without subscribing to the reasoning of the majority. Associate Justices Byron R. White, Harry A. Blackmun and Lewis F. Powell Jr. dissented. Justice Powell argued that by inferring a private cause of action “absent the most compelling evidence” of Congressional intent the Court was usurping the legislative function of Congress. Other Supreme Court action today included the following: Federal Jurisdiction The Court ruled 6 to 3 that the law giving Federal courts jurisdiction over allegations of violations of constitutional or civil rights does not cover a suit whose basis is simply that a state law conflicts with a Federal law. Although highly technical, this decision (Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organization, No. 77‐719), is important in erecting a barrier to Federal court suits by welfare recipients. In this case, a group of welfare recipients went into Federal court in Texas charging that local welfare regulations violated a Federal law, the Social Security Act. The majority opinion by Associate Justice Stevens held that even though such a conflict would violate the supremacy clause of the Constitution such a violation is not the kind of constitutional allegation that confers Federal court jurisdiction. Medicaid Abortion The Court refused to hear a challenge to a Massachusetts law that removed state financing from all abortions except those necessary to prevent the death of, the mother or in instances of rape or incest. A Federal appeals court in Boston had upheld the restriction on the ground that the Hyde Amendment, the Federal law prohibiting the use of Federal funds for most abortions, had in effect amended the Medicaid law as it applies to the states and relieved the states of any obligation to provide their own money for the procedure. This case, Baird V. Sharp (No. 78‐1298), is only one of several similar cases now moving through the Federal courts and the Supreme Court may eventually rule on the validity of the Hyde Amendment itself. Legislative Immunity The Justices agreed to decide whether Federal courts are required to recognize a claim of legislative immunity, similar to that enjoyed by members of Congress, in prosecutions of state legislators. Federal courts are divided on the issue. The case the Court accpted today, U.S. V. Gillock (78‐1455), is an appeal by the Federal Government from a ruling tha the Tennessee legislator it was prosecuting on a bribery charge was entitled to a privilege that barred the Government from introducing as evidence any of his “legislative acts,” such as the introduction of a bill. Price Fixing In a case that could be one of the more closely watched issues of the Court's next term, the Justices agreed to decide whether real estate brokers violate the Federal antitrust laws by agreeing on a fixed commission for their services. This case, McLain v. Real Estate Board (No. 78‐1501), is a class‐action suit charging that New Orleans real estate brokers illegally conspired to fix prices by setting a uniform commission of 6 percent of the price of the house. Two lower Federal courts threw the suit out on the ground that the plaintiffs had not shown that the real estate business had enough relationship with interstate commerce to come under the antitrust laws. Case Deferred The Justices announced that they would rehear arguments next term —and so will not decide this year — two cases involving the right of citizens to choose where to file suits against Federal officials. One of the cases, Colby v. Driver (No. 78‐303), is a $1‐billion class‐action suit brought by persons whose mail was opened by the Central Intelligence Agency during its 20‐year program of intercepting mail to and from the Soviet Union. The other, Stafford v. Briggs (No. 771546), was a civil rights case brought by members of an antiwar veterans group against Federal prosecutors. The merits of the allegations are not before the Court, but the decisions are expcted to have an important bearing on the ease with which these kinds of suits can be brought."
TAX UNION PLAYING CHIEF ROLE IN DRIVE,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/15/archives/tax-union-playing-chief-role-in-drive-aides-refer-to-our.html,"WASHINGTON, May 14 — At the headquarters of the National Taxpayers Union, in a row house on Capitol Hill, they call it “our” constitutional convention. They deny that the opponents or proponents of abortion or busing or free speech or firearms could take control and extensively rewrite the United States Constitution. While the possibility of a takeover is debatable, there is little reason to quibble about the proprietary claims of the National Taxpayers Union to a possible constitutional convention on balanced Federal budgets. It has played an important role in helping to guide the resolutions calling for a constitutional convention through almost two‐thirds of the state legislatures. “They were remarkably successful until it became known what they were doing,” said Richard Moe, Vice President Mondale's chief of staff and the head of a White House panel set up to block such an amendment. “Nobody was paying any attention to what they were doing.” Membership Up Fivefold Resolutions by 34 state legislatures are needed to get Congress to call a constitutional convention. Thirty resolutions have been obtained. The union, which grew from 20,000 members in 1976 to 100,000 today, has spent much of its 10‐year existence opposing and ridiculing government spending. The staff and officers of the organization believe that Congress is so compulsively addicted to deficit financing that it will “never” balance a budget without “constitutional discipline.” A Maryland State Senator, James Clark, felt the same way and in 1975 nursed a resolution through his state's Legislature asking Congress to propose for ratification by the states a balanced budget amendment or to call a constitutional convention on the issue. Similar resolutions were passed that year in Mississippi, North)Sakota and Rhode Island. Since the convention that wrote the Constitution in 1787, there has never been another convention, although Article V says that Congress “on the application of the legislatures of two‐thirds of the several states shall call a convention for proposing amendments.” Common Cause Rejected Plea With 34 state resolutions required, Senator Clark believed that an organized national effort was needed and tried to interest Common Cause, the public affairs lobby. “They weren't interested,” said James Dale Davidson, the young founder of the National Taxpayers Union, “and Senator Clark came to us.” An organizational meeting in Kansas City, Mo., in December 1975 attracted a small group of state legislators and others and, in Senator Clark's words, “the N.T.U. began coordinating the effort.” A model resolution was written and sponsors were sought in the legislatures. After the first four states in 1975, eight states passed resolutions in 1976, five in 1977, five in 1978 and eight so far this year, making a total of 30, or four short of two‐thirds. A speech in January by California's Governor, Edmund G. Brown Jr., endorsing a balanced budget amendment was a major factor in mobilizing opponents of the idea into action. ‘Just What We Feared’ “We knew that would happen, and Brown's speech • was just what we feared,” Mr. Davidson said in an interview. However, people at the taxpayers union are not angry with Godernor Brown and see him as a valuable ally in what is now a fight in the spotlight of publicity. Spokesmen for the taxpayers union accuse their opponents of using “scare tactics” to block resolutions in such states as Montana and California, particularly of conjuring up the possibility of a “runaway” constitutional convention that would propose many amendments and fundamentally alter the Constitution. In the resolutions it has helped to shepherd through legislatures, the taxpayers union has been careful to limit the convention request to the single issue of a mandatory balanced budget except in times of national emergency. “There is no reason the convention would run amok or that it could not be limited to a single issue,” said Grover Norquist, the 24‐year‐old executive director of the taxpayers union. Debate About Loopholes An argument invoked by President Carter this year is that an amendment would necessarily have so many loopholes that it would be meaningless. The tarpapers’ union has a somewhat chilling answer to that. It says that it would fight for an amendment in which there would be no legal definition of an escape‐hatch emergency and in which only a vote of a large majority of Congress could allow a budget deficit. As passionate as the organization is about a constitutionally mandated balanced budget, it sees the amendment as only a first step in what Mr. Davidson Calls “a long series of reforms.” One, Mr. Bonner said, is a future constitutional amendment that would set the maximum income tax rate at perhaps 25 percent."
Adoptive Families: Reunion Picnic in the Suburbs,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/15/archives/adoptive-families-reunion-picnic-in-the-suburbs-scarcity-of.html,"LARCHMONT, N.Y., May 12— What with the rain and a toy‐tractor traffic jam on the lawn, the picnic had all the trappings of any children's party. The children scampered around, and their parents talked about what they would tell the youngsters when they were old enough to ask where they came from. But for these families the answer would not involve the customary conversation about storks or genetics or hospitals, because these children were born in a home for unwed mothers in Texas. The occasion was the annual picnic for families in the metropolitan area who have adopted children from the Edna Gladney Home in Fort Worth, which places about 400 youngsters each year with adoptive parents around the country. The home arranges adoptions and provides care and counseling before and after delivery, in much the same way that it has for the last 82 years, except that the mothers now give birth in the home's private hospital. The families who adopt Gladney children never meet the mothers, but the adoptive parents keep in touch with one another. The continued contact with the Gladney organization, they say, gives the youngsters a sense of identity that makes growing up easier. Most parents at the picnic said they would not think of hiding the fact that their children were adopted. Richard and Barbara Moore of Bronxville, N.Y., said that in a few years they will take their two Gladney children back to the home, “so they can see where they came from.” And most parents said they had no fear of their children's eventual and perhaps inevitable identity crisis — the day when the child would wish to know who his or her biological mother was. “Right now she thinks everybody is adopted,” said Gretchen Zollendeck, whose 4-year-old daughter, Heidi, was running around with a box of cookies in her hand. “At nursery school somebody said his mom had a baby in her tummy and Heidi thought it was the biggest joke in the world.” “If she wants to be one of those searchers,” Mrs. Zollendeck added, “I hope I'll be able to answer her questions.” In anticipation of the questions, the Gladney home gives each adoptive parent a folder that tells the background and medical history of the mother and the child— everything but the mother's name. As Heidi ran from a porch into the backyard, the executive director of the Gladney home, Ruby Lee Piester, who regularly travels to Gladney functions such as this one, sat on a sofa in the living room and talked about the moral values of the women who check into the home these days. Surprisingly, she said, those values had not been redefined by the popularity of the pill, the availability of abortions or the possibility of high‐paying, high‐pressure careers. “Every girl I know wants the same basic things I wanted when I was a teen‐ager,” the 63-year-old Mrs. Piester said in her gentle Southern accent. “A home, a family and a good strong relationship with her husband.” Scarcity of Children Mrs. Piester, who has been at the home for 18½ years and has no children of her own, said that the number of pregnant women being accepted at the home has not declined recently. But the number of children available for adoption still falls far short of the demand. Each year, she said, more than 5,000 adoption applications arrive. The applicants are screened for financial and educational background and marital stability, and a committee then picks the couples who will take Gladney children home. As for the real mothers, each receives a fictitious name when she checks in, and she is advised to tell none of the other mothers-to-be her real name, job or hometown. Women who enter the Gladney home are charged according to their ability to pay. The home has a $9‐million budget, much of which comes from private foundations, according to Mrs. Piester. One innovation, Mrs: Piester said, is the toll‐free telephone number — (800) 433‐7004, which pregnant young women around the country may call to talk about their problems with others who have had to decide whether to have an abortion, have the baby but put it up for adoption, or marry the father. “Our girls are caught in this change of society without knowing where they're going, and their pregnancies are often a‐form of reaching out,” Mrs. Piester said. “If they'd been swingers, they wouldn't have gotten pregnant. “There are so’ many teen‐age pregnancy prevention programs that set up so much emphasis on birth control,” she continued. “I agree that they need to know these things, but they.need:4o understand more than that.”"
Medical College To Oppose Pact To Do Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/15/archives/medical-college-to-oppose-pact-to-do-abortions-archdiocese-stand.html,"The director of health and hospitals for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York said yesterday that he would seek to nullify a proposed agreement under which New York Médical College would be expected by the city to provide abortion services at Lincoln and Metropolitan municipal hospitals. The archdiocesan stand was expressed after the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation announced at City Hall that it would sign a new affiliation contract with the medical college, to take effect July 1, to provide regionalized medical services at the two municipal institutions. Joseph C. Hoffman, the corporation's president, 'said that medical services would include abortions. New York Medical College, which says it is nonsectarian, is the only affiliate with the hospitals. The archdiocese took control of the medical college a year ago in exchange for a commitment to pay its debts. The archdiocese did so because it wanted a medical school of its own. The health and hospitals director of the archdiocese, Msgr. James P. Cassidy, said yesterday that “we can't have Catholics performing abortions.” However, the existing affiliation contract between the college and Metropolitan Hospital Center in Manhattan requires the college to deliver abortion services despite archdiocesan opposition. Abortions Banned at Lincoln “We inherited the contract at Metropolitan and there was nothing that could be done legally to get out of providing abortions until it expired,” said Msgr. Eugene Clark, the director of communications for the archdiocese. In contrast, abortions have been banned at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx since Misericordia Hospital Medical Center, a Catholic institution in the Bronx that is affiliated with the college, began providing Lincoln's medical services two years ago. Misericordia's’ contract allowed it to refuse to provide abortion services in deference to the Catholic Cburch's opposition to abortion. The question of whether • abortions will be’ performed at Lincoln Hospital arises now because the'tiew.. Contract is coming up. • Under affiliation contracts in general, a medical school or a teaching hospital provides medical care in a municipal hospital.while the city provides administrative and supporj services.‘ Under the proposed regionalized affili. ätlon contrae[‘announced :yesterday by Mr. Hoffman, the college would continue providing medical services at Metropolitan and take over from Misericordia at Lincoln, under a joint $24‐million‐a‐year contract. In a statement, Mr. Hoffman said Lincoln “would be performing abortions.” However, Monsignors Cassidy and Clark said that the college, even though it is technically nonsectarian, would not provide any abortion services and that it would be up to the city's Hospitals Corporation, which operates the city's 17 municipal hospitals, to provide them itself. The opposing positions on the emotionally charged issue of abortion seemed to reflect the positions of Terence Cardinal Cooke, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York, who is a national leader of antiabortion groups, and Mayor Koch."
2 City Hospitals to Do Abortions Despite Archdiocese,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/16/archives/2-city-hospitals-to-do-abortions-despite-archdiocese-a-crying-need.html,"The president of the New York Health and Hospitals Corporation said yesterday that abortions would be performed at Lincoln and Metropolitan municipal hospitals despite the opposition of New York Medical College, the Roman Catholic‐affiliated medical school that will begin providing regionalized medical services at both institutions on July 1. Joseph C. Hoffman, who heads the city's municipal hospital system, said that the corporation would perform separate abortion services at Lincoln Hospital in the South Bronx and at Metropolitan Hospital Center on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He said that the cost of such services had not yet been determined. Msgr. Eugene V. Clark, the director of communications for the Archdiocese of New York, which took control of the medical school last year, said in a statement, “The Archdiocese of New York will never, through a contract or other means, cooperate with abortion, nor will any of the agencies it controls ever do so.” Monsignor Clark also cast doubt on whether any abortion service operated independently of the medical school in either hospital would ever succeed. “Neither the archdiocese,” he said, “nor Catholic doctors will willingly associate with those who encourage or practice abortion.” Even if the college cannot “avoid physical contiguity with agencies and doctors who perform abortions,” Monsignor Clark said it “should not cast the least shadow on the pro‐life principles of Catholic agencies and doctors who have never practiced, permitted or approved of abortion in any way.” Consequently, city hospital officials were uneasy yesterday over the prospect of Catholic‐controlled obstetric and gynecological services at Lincoln and Metropolitan that co‐exist with abortion services. A ‘Crying Need’ Hospital officials could not envision physicians with a college affiliation openly referring patients for birth‐control measures or sterilization, much less abortions. Alfred F. Moran, the executive vice president of Planned Parenthood of New York City, said that if the medical college impeded the delivery or referral of aborLion services or any other form of birth control it would seek legal action. Planned Parenthood contends there is a “crying need” for abortion and other birth‐control services among the poor, predominately ‘ HisPanic', •communities that are served by both hosPitals. “On this issue, there can be DO compromise,” Mr. Moran said. “We will not stand by and allow patient's basic rights to be violated.” Lincoln Abortions Banned For more than a year, the medical college has authorized abortions at Metropolitan Hospital. However, Monsignor Clark explained that when the archdiocese took control of the nonsectarian college last year it also inherited the existing affiliation contract the college had at Metropolitan, including the requirement that it provide abortions. “We did not have any choice, we were legally required to do it,” Monsignor Clark said. But he also said that abortions would be stopped the moment the existing affiliation contract expires on July 1 and the new dual one that includes Lincoln Hospital takes its place. In contrast, abortions have been banned at Lincoln Hospital ever since Misericordia Hospital Medical Center, a Catholic‐affiliated institution in the pro’ iiii, began pthvidinganeclical services at Lincoln two years ago. Misericordia's contract allowed it to refuse to provide abortion services. Last July, the hospitals corporation said he would order abortions to be provided at Lincoln, even if it meant bringing in outside, physicians to perform them. But no physicians were ever sent in and no abortion has ever been performed at the hospital despite the fact that it is Mayor Koch's announced policy to provide abortions and Medicaid funds to pay for them to poor women in communities where they live. While Congress has barred Medicaid funds for abortions unless a mother's life is directly threatened or if the pregnancy involves incest or rape, New York State has adopted a far more permissive law which allows Medicaid funds for any abortion which a physician regards as “medically necessary.”"

The Region,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/18/archives/the-region-deadlock-remains-on-olympic-funds.html,"WASHINGTON — An abrupt reversal of position by the Carter Administration has failed to break a deadlock over how to. rescue the deficit‐ridden 1980 Winter Olympics at Lake Placid, N.Y. The Administration's reversal came in the form of an announcement that it was lifting certain conditions it had imposed on the $11 million it had agreed to contribute to close an $18 million deficit for the Olympic Games. As part of a deal to win the increased Federal aid, the Lake Placid Olympics Organizing Committee earlier agreed to pare its deficit from $18 million to $13.6 million. With the $11 million in Federal funds, the $2.6 million deficit thus remains the subject of the deadlock. Aides to Mr. Carter insisted that they would not put up any more money, and that the $2.6 million would have to come from state or local sources. Governor Carey's office reiterated the state's position thatit would not put up the money, however. Petr Spumey, head of the Olympics committee, said his board of directors would meet soon to decide what to do. Jersey to Collect $60,475 for Dumping NEWARK — A Superior Court judge authorized the state to collect $60,475 from the Chemical Control Corporation, which had been fined after its officials pleaded guilty to violating environmental laws by illegally dumping toxic and hazardous chemicals in vacant lots here and in Union County. The amount ordered collected by the judge, Nicholas Scalera, is the balance of a 575,000 fine imposed on the Elizabeth company last year. Chemical Control's chemical waste disposal facility in Elizabeth was closed down by the state in February after company officials failed to live up to an agreement to remove more than 95,000 drums of hazardous chemicals from the site. State and federal authorities have begun a criminal investigation into the operation of the site. Meanwhile, Mayor Thomas G. Dunn of Elizabeth extended for two weeks the state of emergency declared after discovery of potentially explosive chemicals at the site. Hartford Rejects Bill on Abortion HARTFORD — The House defeated a bill under which a physician would not have been allowed to perform an abortion on a woman under 16 years of age without first informing her parents. The measure, which had been adopted by the Senate, was rejected by a vote of 80 to 58 after a lengthy debate about whether parental permission should be required, and, if so, what appeals process should exist in cases where permission was denied. During the debate, the question arose as to whether certain amendments passed by the House were inconsistent with each other, and if so which one took precedence, prompting many Representatives to complain that they were confused about what they were voting on. Others said they were opposing the measure because it imposed burdens on young women but not on their partners. Police Dispute Ends In Mount Vernon WHITE PLAINS — Mount Vernon's 40‐member auxiliary police force, which was dismissed earlier this month by the city's civil defense director for staging a sickout last month, was reinstated after a series of negotiation.t with city officials.

Mr. Deal said that although the girls had admitted bringing the brownies and acid to school, they apparently changed their minds and did not attempt to give them to the teachers. The pupils have been suspended pending action by the school board."
Trenton Ponders Morality Issues,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/20/archives/new-jersey-weekly-trenton-ponders-morality-issues-legislature-is.html,"TRENTON IF EVERYTHING goes according to schedule, the Legislature will vote Thursday on a proposal to revise the abortion laws, thus plunging itself once more into “moral” issue. While the state's courts have clearly been shying away from involvement in such issues, the Legislature has been moving, sometimes awkwardly, in the opposite direction, taking on such issues as sex and drinking. Assemblyman Thomas J. Deverin, Democrat of Carteret, introduced the abortion‐law revision last year, and, like other moral issues, it has created storm of controversy. The proposed measure says that life begins at the moment of conception, and that it is the state's position that there should be abortions only for medical reasons. Mr. Deverin's bill would not outlaw abortions—the United States Supreme Court has ruled they are legal — but would require a woman, before being permitted to have an abortion, to sign statements that she has been told that it is the state's position that her unborn baby is a human being. The measure also would require woman to wait 48 hours between signing the statement and having the abortion. Mr. Deverin said he thought that opposition to his bill had cooled down, even among those women's rights groups who assert that the Legislature has no right to decide if a woman may have an abortion. In the last three years, the courts have reversed, as an invasion of privacy, the convictions of people for “deviant” sexual conduct; have ruled that, with proper safeguards, terminally ill people have the right to die and have held that the state government should not use its police powers to invade the bedroom. At the same time, the state's lawmakers have made several attempts to legislate life styles, especially in sexual matters. In this, the Legislature has received some support from the New Jersey Catholic Conference, an association of prelates from both the Roman Catholic and the Greek Orthodox Churches. One major religious group, the New Jersey Council of Churches, has cautioned that, in its view, government does society a disservice when behavior frowned on by most people is considered a crime. The Legislature currently is in a dispute over whether to raise the legal drinking age from 18 years to 19. The Senate already has voted to do so, but the plan is running into opposition in the Assembly, where questions have been raised about the basic premise behind the move: That lowering the drinking age from 21 years to 18 in 1973 created problems. Governor Byrne, police and school officials and a host of parents have endorsed the idea of raising the age. School officials say that an increase in rowdiness at many schools has been caused by drinking students. Opponents contend that the rise in automobile accidents caused by drinking and drunk teen‐agers is no more than the increase that has been recorded in states where the minimum age is still 21. Several legislators have said that since 18-year-olds in New Jersey are considered adults for every other purpose, they should not be discriminated against by being legally stopped from drinking. “I'm going to vote for the bill even though I'm against it,” one legislator said. “The public wants it.” Several members of the Assembly Judiciary Committee would not allow the Senate‐passed drinking bill to be released from committee until it was amended to provide that it would not become effective unless four companion measures also become law. These would: ¶Require public schools to teach the effects of alcohol as part of the regular curriculum. ¶Provide that color photographs of drivers under 21 be affixed to their licenses. ¶Allow the 30‐day suspension of the driver's license of anyone under 19 who enters a bar or liquor store. ¶Provide that persons under 19 caught buying alcohol could be required by a judge to attend an alcoholeducation or treatment program. The most publicized examples of the Legislature's becoming involved in moral questions have dealt with sexual matters, principally the age of sexual consent, homosexuality, pornography and abortion. But there have been other issues. For example, the Legislature has attempted to require all New Jerseyans to show respect for the flag, and to join in the Pledge of Allegiance when it is publicly recited. From time to time, some lawmakers have warned their colleagues that it is folly to try to legislate attitudes. In debate on a bill to make it a crime for persons 16 years and older to engage in sex with persons under 16, Senator Martin L. Greenberg, Democrat of East Orange and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said that the Legislature should not try to set moral standards for people. That, he contended, is within the purview of the home, the church and schools. Senator Matthew L. Feldman, Democrat of Teaneck and a former President of the upper house, said he would prefer it if, the Legislature did not become involved in trying to regulate morals by law., But he noted there was a public demand for such laws, which he attributed to a breakdown of sorts in the family structure. “They want us to put into effect rules they can't,” Senator Feldman said. “The other night, I was at a meeting in Englewood and some of the parents there wanted me to introduce a bill to prohibit kids from loitering on the streets.” Assemblyman Richard J. Codey, Democrat of Orange, said, “Some- times it becomes necessary to legislate morals.” According to Mr. Codey, areas in which the Legislature is justified in prescribing conduct include sex, the use of drugs and alcohol and abortions. Asked whether he felt that religion was a valid subject for legislation, Mr. Codey replied: “I don't know about that.” Assemblyman Richard Van Wagner, Democrat of Belford, who is a teacher and school administrator, said he considered sex, drugs and alcohol to be subjects that the Legislature should regulate by laws. Edward J. Leadem, executive director of the New Jersey Catholic Conference, gave the conference's views on these matters during the recent debate on the bill to establish the age of sexual consent. “The Legislature has the duty and power, in the interests of the common good, to enact all manner of laws designed for the protection of public health, welfare, safety and morals,” Mr. Leadem said, adding: “This is referred to as the ‘police power’ and has been designated as an essential element of social compact, an attribute of sovereignty possessed by states before the adoption of the Federal Constitution. “The ‘police power’ is a public right of reasonable regulation for common good and welfare.” The Rev. Paul L. Stagg, general sec- retary of the New Jersey Council of Churches, said he was “disturbed by the fact that we live in a time of increasing breakdown of traditional moral codes.” “Our concern in this issue is not with our continuing struggle to support commitment to ethics and morality that will maximize the full humanity of every child of God,” he declared. “Our concern is the effect of the Criminal Code legislation on those human lives that need help, not punishment.” Punitive laws passed by the Legislature may make people feel virtuous, Mr. Stagg said, but the effect can be to destroy the lives of people who transgress them. In a landmark case in December 1977, the State Supreme Court held that legislation dealing with morals had created a need for a new judicial concept: the sanctity of personal privacy. In that proceeding, the court ruled that the New Jersey law prohibiting fornication was unconstitutional. It held that, unless there was a compelling reason, the state “may not regulate a person's private decisions which have merely incidental effect on others.” “The crux of the matter is that governmental regulation of private personal behavior under the police power is sharply limited,” the court concluded in a unanimous decision. Among the freedoms that the Legislature has no right to impinge upon, the court said, are those of personal development, to do intimate things and the “integrity” of one's personality. In March 1976, the State Supreme Court ruled that homosexual acts between consenting adults, when performed in private, were not violations of the law, even though state law prohibited such acts. In line with that decision, the state's new Code of Criminal Justice, which is scheduled to go into effect on Sept. 1, would legalize all sexua’ acts between consenting adults. There was a spirited fight last fall when several legislators, led by Senator Joseph A. Maressa, Democrat of Blackwood tr':..11 to push through a new law to make homesexual conduct a crime. Senator Maressa said he wasn't so much interested in seeing homosexuals in prison as he was in driving them “back into the closet.” ■"
Brennan Opens Way For Suit in Bay State On Welfare Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/20/archives/brennan-opens-way-for-suit-in-bay-state-on-welfare-abortions.html,"BOSTON, May 19 (AP) — A United States Supreme Court Justice has cleared the way for a “econd challenge in the Court to a Massachusetts law curbing abortions paid for with welfare funds. Justice William J. Brennan Jr., ruling on a procedural question, yesterday gave the Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts 25 days to file a request for a new hearing by the Supreme Court on the statute, called the Doyle‐Flynn law. The antiabortion restriction has been on state lawbooks for nearly a year but has not been implemented while its constitutionality is, being challenged in the courts. The law would allow the state to continue financing abortions only in cases in which a woman's life was at stake or in which pregnancy resulted from rape or incest. The current policy permits state funds for any “medically necessary” welfare abortion, and hundreds of abortions are judged to fall into that category each month. Challenge on Technical Grounds On Monday, the Supreme Court refused to hear the case, an action that set the stage for the state to put the tighter restrictions into effect. However, the civil rights organization challenged• that decision on technical grounds, contending that a recent ruling by a Federal judge in Illinois should have been considered before the Court rejected the suit. The Illinois ruling calls into question the constitutionality of a Federal antiabortion provision, known as the Hyde amendment, that is similar to the Doyle‐Flynn restriction. Justice Brennan's move gives the rights group time to prepare documentation elaborating upon that argument. In practical terms, it delays for at least month any change in procedure by the Massachusetts Welfare Department."
Huntington Tabloid Arouses Controversy,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/20/archives/long-island-weekly-huntington-tabloid-arouses-controversy.html,"HUNTINGTON if OTTA gripe?” asks the Sunday Digest, a weekly tabloid delivered free throughout the Towns of Huntington and Smithtown. “Then write and tell us about it.” Many of the “gripe sheets” it gets back, however, are about the newspaper itself, which — unlike most of the “shopper” tabloids that circulate in the towns and villages of the North Shore — has angered numerous readers and civic and educational groups that charge that the tabloid's executive editor, Stan Sousa, practices irresponsible journalism and is creating fear, confusion and division in their community The reaction of Mr. Sousa's supporters is equally strong. For instance, convalescent reader recently arranged to have the paper delivered to Huntington Hospital along with 50 additional copies for the other patients. “When I took over this paper a‘; editor two years ago, we knew we couldn't just continue to be another run-of-the- mill weekly to survive,” said Mr. Sousa, 50 years old and a reporter for 12 years with the former Long Island Press. “So we tried to pick up on some of the issues that people were frustrated about, and we've been very popular and successful,” he said. These topics include homosexual teachers, abortion, the Equal Rights Amendment and, most recently, sex education in public schools. Among those who find Mr. Sousa's editorial policies offensive are Lester Baltimore and Armstrong Starkey, both associate professors of history at Adelphi University and residents of Huntington. They charged that the editorials in the Sunday Digest have been “written in MI emotional and vitriolic manner, presenting a serious challenge to the community and to the concept of a free press.” As an example, they cite a front‐page editorial appearing on March 11 entitled “It's Time,” citing a “rumor” that a small group of homosexual teachers were about to openly proclaim their homosexuality. The two professors charged that Mr. Sousa used “the worst features of demagogy to attack this group as an example of a vague enemy within,” and to make “a thinly veiled call for violence against homosexuals.” The Sunday Digest editorial said: “And, if it comes to a confrontation, we and our community will show the pressure‐makers what pressure really is; if the ‘gays’ want to shout in the streets, we'll take to the rooftops: and, if they try demonstrations, we'll give them a day-and-night display of cornmunity strength that'll be miles long. And, if they want peace, our terms will be severe+ no homosexual teachers in our primary and secondary grades.” Mr. Sousa said he was satisfied with the outcome of the editorial in that “it had achieved its objective.” “We didn't want the homosexuals to come forward and organize, as they apparently have in New York City,” he said. “We wanted to prevent the organization of any homosexual group that would affect our public school teaching system.” He insisted that the editorial was not based on rumor, but on “reports” that he had received “a year ago.” He declined to comment on the “reports” further. In another recent incident involving the Sunday Digest, a group of demonstrators who described themselves as concerned parents disrupted a health fair sponsored by the Huntington Youth Board at Stimson Junior High School. The group of nearly a dozen protestors, described by Mr. Sousa as an ad hoc committee, protested the fair as “sick” in that it included panel discus. sions on teen‐age sexuality, understanding homosexuality, alcohol and drugs. William C. Farrell, chairman of the Huntington Youth Board, said what bothered him most was that the Sunday Digest “ignored the fair, which drew a crowd of 200 parents and their teen‐age children, and covered only the disruption by the protestors,” one of whom was removed by the police and later released. Mr. Farrell added, however, that the protest appeared to have worked in the youth board's favor. “Dozens of people have come up to me since the incident, and a Sunday Digest editorial critical of the board, and told me they support the youth program and what it's doing.” “that had there been no editorial, anyone would have said anything either way.” However, Mr. Farrell said that another health fair that was to be held at Commack school was subsequently canceled because of the controversy. Mr. Sousa, who has three grown children and lives with his wife in Huntington, said that “when it comes to editorials, we're inclined to do what we want, but on the letters-to-the-editors page, we print both pro and con.”, “We're in the middle of an issue right now,” he said. “One of our readers sent a letter which we published that said that elderly citizens were getting too much help at the expense of the taxpayer.” “In return, we received many letters, mostly from the elderly, saying they deserved the help since they worked for it,” said Mr. Sousa, adding that he had not taken an editorial stand on this particular issue. The Sunday Digest, however, has taken editorial stands for the death penalty and against abortion, the Equal Rights Amendment, local taxes, teachers’ unions and flea markets. “We've been called everything from right to left,” said Mr. Sousa. “The Republicans accuse us of being Democrats, the Democrats accuse us of being Republicans, and the leftists called us John Birch and vice versa.” “What we're really basically for,” he said, “is God, country and community.” The Sunday Digest, which has a circulation of 94,459, is owned by Huntington Pennysaver Inc., a weekly giveaway shoppers’ guide with an audited circulation of 118,555, and has offices at 95 East Main Street, Huntington, and at 415 Lake Avenue, St. James. Both the Sunday Digest and the Pennysaver are delivered in plastic bags to the homeowners’ doorsteps by the Reliable Delivery Service, which is also owned by Huntington Pennysaver. Some homeowners welcome their arrival on Sunday morning. Others threaten to sue the Pennysaver for littering and insist that the deliveries be halted. Some individuals and groups editorially attacked by the Sunday Digest have also urged that businessess that advertise in the newspaper be boycotted until they withdraw their financial support of the paper. ■"
Phil Donahue: ‘TV Underestimates Women’,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/20/archives/phil-donahue-tv-underestimates-women.html,"Without song or shtik, the syndicated program “Donahue” - carried locally weekdays at 9 A.M. on -WNBC-TV - has become the most popular daytime talkshow in America. It has grown steadily since its birth 12 years ago on a local station in Dayton, Ohio, and this month reached two milestones. Beginning last Monday, a mini‐version of the show beCame a three-times-a-week segment on NBC's “Today.” And earlier this month, the one‐hour “Donahue,” which normally originates from Chicago, traveled to Madison Square Garden's Felt Forum for a week of remote broadcasts - the first time the show, with its great Midwestern and rural appeal, ventured to New York City. No small part of the success formula of the “Donahue” show is Phil Donahue himself - a slightly square, divorced Irish Catholic, who at age 43 is raising four of his five children ‘alone. He relates as well to housewives (“I know the softener goes in during the rinse cycle”) as he does to female activists (he's a member.of the National Organization for Women). To the roughly six million women who watch him each day, Mr. Donahue is the husband who listens for a change, the lover who dresses smartly in three‐piece suits, and the country minister who comforts, advises and seems to always come down on the right side of an issue. “A lot of the attention we enjoy,” said Mr. Donahue after taping one of his New York shows, “comes not because we have any special genius but because of the way the programmers have designed the rest of the daytime schedule. I think audiences have always wanted this type of show. All we did was plug into it.” What “Donahue” offers is a full hour of discussion on a single subject. Topics range from marriage to divorce, childbirth to abortion, as well as to consumer, legal and religious matters, with an occasional sprinkling of celebrity chatter. Thehost leads the questionini of guests but depends to a large extent on participation of the studio audience, process enhanced by restructuring the standard studio floor plan. Instead of placing the cameras between the guests and the audience as is the norm z- television, the cameras for the )onahue” show are located unobtruvely beyond the audience where they record the interaction of guests and questioners much as they would be used to cover a football game. Thanks to this subtle device, guests don't play to the cameras; they deal directly with the audience. The result is often a refreshingly candid exchange of ideas. • Home base for “Donahue” is WGNTV, an independent station in Chicago, where the program is telecast live each morning before being distributed on tape to 164 other outlets around the country. “There are no cue cards,” the host explained, “no applause sign, no sweetening [the adding of canned laughter or applause] and no editing. If we goof, we goof.” In Chicago, where the studio holds only 200 people, women wait more than a year for “Donahue” tickets. At the Felt Forum, some 22,000 were accommodated during the week - but WNBC says ticket requests exceeded 100,000. “TV studios are like churches,” Mr. Donahue said while warming up one of his New York audiences, “they're almost always empty and dark.” Yet, here were some 4,300 people - all but few of them women - gathered in huge, brightly lighted arena to participate in a national talkshow. “We really think we were this good eight years ago,” he told them, “but hot• is what New York says is hot.” With the taping underway, Mr. Donahue scampered up and down the aisles soliciting questions with a wireless microphone. On this particular day, the guests were attorneys Marvin Mitchelson and David Kagan, who had recently argued the Marvin v. Marvin “palimony” case in California. Despite their years of courtroom experience, the lawyers seemed taken aback by the show's format, which had the bast and his audience firing questions at them at machine‐gun speed from distant corners of the arena. During the first commercial break, Mr. Donahue shouted Petit” Funt is a freelance writerovho frequently reports on the television wane. instructions to the audience: “Please make sure your questions get right to the point! Make me look good, ladies. need your help!” It worked. The women asked compelling questions. Each clutched Mr. Donahue's hand for support and was not offended when he turned his back and dashed to the next row for another quick question. “This is the best audience we've ever had!” he said during the next break. “I promise I'll never forget you.” The show ended with a standing ovation for the host. “Go straight home,” he advised,. “and don't talk to any strange men!” An observer got the feeling that if a wagon were rolled out now with bottles of snake oil, there would be 4,300 buyers. •• For most of “Donahue's” audience, the highlight of the day comes after the taping. The producer had announced that “Phil will stand out in front and say goodbye until every last person has left this building.” So with jacket off and sleeves rolled up, he stood in the Garden lobby like a minister awaiting comments from his parishoners. “You're a genius.” . . . “Super show, Phil.” . . . “God bless the Irish.” . . “Thanks for the last 12 years.” .. . “We love you in Connecticut.” . . . “It's nice to meet you after having breakfast with you every day.” He shook each hand and received several thousand pecks on the cheek. Then, he turned his attention to another group that had waited patiently for autographs and pictures. They had forined a line five‐across that circled the entire lobby. An hour and 15 minutes later Mr. Donahue was still smiling as he posed for a picture with the last three women before retreating to his “I say goodbye to the audience every day in Chicago,” Mr. Donahue explained, nibbling on a hamburger and finishing a beer. “Of course, with 200 people it only takes 10 or 15 minutes.” But why do it at all? “Because I'm grateful. I had only been doing the s,how a few days in Dayton when I realized women were asking questions during the breaks that were better than mine. So we put them on. Without the audience we wouldn't have a show.” How much of “Donahue” is just an act? “Smile of it,” he replied. “I respect these women, but, O.K., some of what I do is show biz. Don't forget there's a guy on the other channel giving away $25,000, and he's got a woman jumping up and down dressed like a chicken‐salad sandwich and, by God, better have something going on my show because this is a very competitive business.” Phil Donahue is privately bitter about the “competitive business” of television. He sees a correlation between his own 12‐year struggle for success and the plight of women who want something meaningful from daytime television. In both cases, he depicted the obstacle as a “male‐dominated, power‐broker media whose energies are focused in New York.” “I don't want to sound like an egomaniac,” he said, “but we had 50 shares [ratings percentages of viewing audiences] in major northern industrial cities for a long time. Yet, we couldn't get much publicity or national media attention until WNBC began carrying the show [in Sept., 1977] .’ This led Mr. Donahue to comment on daytime television and the general caliber of programming: “I think there is sexism and paternalism among the programmers who decide what goes on. There's a suggestion that women have to be more protected than men. Broadcast executives are often surprised when women in my audience ask smart question's, the implication being tbthat women can't ask smart questions, That tells you a lot about the attitude of the people who run this business.” • By continuing to operate out of Chicago - where his “Today” segments will also be taped - Mr. Donahue is like the politician who somehow got elected without the machine's support and now owes no favors. “We have more freedom than anyone in the business,” he boasted. “People stand up on our show and say, ‘I got my ring at Sears and the stone fell out,’ and nobody jumps in and edits it or calls meeting.” Occasionally, though, stations refuse to air controversial shows. WGN balked at one “Donahue” program featuring footage of the birth of baby and another showing a reverse vasectomy. His frustrations about the medium notwithstanding, Mr. Donahue is reaping television's rewards. He has two national Emmys and, as this article is going to press, is in line for a third. He claims to have turned down several network offers for prime‐time projects and is flattered that his name is included among the candidates for Johnny Carson's job. “It's really fun now,” he conceded with a grin. “For so many years people misspelled our name and wouldn't return our calls. Now, I enjoy the power and influence.” Considering his success, Mr. Don/hue is somewhat bewildered by the fact that others have not tried to copy his format. “There should be more of what we do,” he said. “The men who run television still grossly underestimate the American woman.” As his New York visit ended, Mr. Donahue was pleased to learn that special guest named Silverman had been in the audience for the fourth show - listening attentively to the warm‐up, applauding enthusiastically during the taping, even joining the crowd at the door to say goodbye. “I enjoy your show very much,” said Cathy Silverman. The host sailed, and patted the wife of the NBC president on the cheek. After 12 years on daytime television, Phil Donahue knows who his fans are. ■ The host of daytime's most popular talk show"
POLITICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/20/archives/long-island-weekly-politics-conservatives-try-squeeze-play.html,"THE next month will be crucial in the rocky relationship between the Republican and Conservative Parties in Suffolk County. in a classic political squeeze play, the Conservatives are threatening to deny endorsement to County Executive John V. N. Klein, a move that could cost him as much as 30,000 votes in the fall election. At this point, it appears that Mr. Klein, a Republican confronted with sewer and other G.O.P. scandals, will need every vote he can get. The Conservatives are also raising he possibility of an alliance with the rs‐w Right to I.ife Party to siphon more votes from Mr Klein. The threats are retaliation for what the Conservatives contend was an invasion of their party by 266 Islip Republicans who transferred their enrollment last fall in the midst of an internal upheaval that still continues within the Islip Conservative Party. The plain implication of the mass transfer of enrollment was that Islip Republicans were trying to take over the Conservative Party in the town. That could threaten the very existence of the party since its stock in trade, along with the Liberals,’ is to have a tightly disciplined party in which its leadershiop can deliver nominations or deny them to the major parties. The Conservatives want the new converts in Islip to go back where they came from in the G.O.P. However, there has been no move because Islip G.O.P. leaders deny any plot and con- tend that the mass conversion was spontaneous. The acrimony between the parties comes less than a year after they reached a peak of togetherness, with the Republicans playing a major role in electing the first Conservative member of the House of Representatives — Wilham Carney of the First District — last fall. The current disagreement, if it is to be settled at all, should be resolved by mid‐June, when designating petitions for candidates will be circulated. Gilbert C. Hanse, the Suffolk Republican leader, is optimistic that he can resolve the differences. “I don't think it's at the point where it's chiseled in stone,” he said. His Conservative counterpart, John A. Kay. wasn't as optimistic, even after a brief unplanned meeting with Mr. Hanse in Albany 10 days ago. “I think it would take a miracle to change it,” he said. The Conservative leader threatened legal action against the 266 Islip converts, arguing that a party can challenge its enrollees on whether “they adhere to the principles of the party.” As part of the pressure on the Republicans, Mr. Kay has also met with Dominic J. Baranello. the Democratic county chairman, to discuss possible cross‐endorsements. He also discussed the posssible alliance with the new Right to Life Party, which polled a respectable 12,445 votes in Suffolk in last year's gubernatorial election, nearly triple the Liberal Party tally in the county for Governor Carey. The Conservatives tallied 26,991 votes for Perry B. Duryea. Mr. Kay, presumably strengthening his bargaining hand with the Republicans, noted that he has personal as well as political ties with the Right to Life leadership. “We've been on picket lines and buses to Washington together,” he said A friend, Donald A. Doyle of Com- mack, is part of the Long Island triumvirate running the Right to Life Party in its organizing stages. The other two leaders are Mary Jane Tobin and Ellen McCormack, both of Merrick. Obviously putting the squeeze on Mr. Klein, Mr. Kay said that even if the current difficulties with the Islip G.O.P. are settled, he has problems with Mr. Klein's position on abortion, particularly the County Executive's veto of a measure approved by the County Legislature that would have denied Medicaid funds for abortion unless a woman's life was in jeopardy. Mr. Klein said that he had to veto the measure because the state had already authorized the Medicaid funds. “As long as the state permits it, I'll abide by the law,” Mr. Klein said. Mr. Ilanse, the Republican county chairman, said that Mr. Klein had already explained his position to Mr. Kay but the Conservatives are still raising it, possibly for bargaining purposes. Asked for his personal position on abortion because it could become an issue, Mr. Klein sounded in tune with both the Conservatives and Right to Life stance when he said that he opposed abortion except “in case of danger to the mother.” Thus, it would appear that he would qualify for endorsement by the two minor parties at least on that issue. Mr. Klein said he was willing to talk issues with the Conservatives. But he said he would leave it to Mr. Hanse to resolve the political differences, even though he is the prime victim or beneficiary of these discussions. The Conservatives currently have about 15 members in various county posts, but Mr. Kay denied that the party was bargaining for more. That remains to be seen in the next month."
Long Island Weekly Paper Stirs Charges of ‘Vitriol’,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/20/archives/brooklyn-pages-long-island-weekly-paper-stirs-charges-of-vitriol.html,"HUNTINGTON, L.I. — “Gotta gripe?” asks the Sunday Digest, a weekly tabloid delivered free throughout the Towns of Huntington and Smithtown. “Then write and tell us about it.” Many of the “gripe sheets” it gets back, however, are about the newspaper itself, which - unlike most of the “shopper” tabloids that circulate in the towns and villages of the North Shore - has angered numerous readers and civic and educational groups that charge that the tabloid's executive editor, Stan Sousa, practices irresponsible journalism and is creating fear, confusion and division in their community. The reaction of Mr. Sousa's supporters is equally strong. For instance, a convalescent reader recently arranged to have the paper delivered to Huntington Hospital along with 50 additional copies for the other patients. Chose Issues of Concern “When I took over this paper as editor two years ago, we knew we couldn't just continue to be another run-of-the-mill weekly to survive,” said Mr. Sousa, 50 years old and a reporter for 12 years with the former Long Island Press. “So we fried to pick up on some of the issues that people were frustrated about, and we've been very popular and successful,” he said. These topics include homosexual teachers, abortion, the Equal Rights Amendment and, most recently, sex education in public schools. Among those who find Mr. Sousa's editorial policies offensive are Lester Baltimore and Armstrong Starkey, both associate professors of history at Ade1phi University and residents of ‘Huntington. They charged that the editorials in the Sunday Digest have been “written in an emotional and vitriolic manner, presenting a serious challenge to the community and to the concept of a free press.” As an example, they cite a front‐page editorial appearing on March 11 entitled “It's Time, citing a “rumor” that small group of homosexual teachers were about to openly proclaim their homosexuality. The two professors charged that Mr. Sousa used “the worst features of demagogy to attack this group as an example of a vague enemy within,” and to make “a thinly veiled call for violence against homosexuals.” The Sunday Digest editorial said: “And, if it comes to a confiontation, we and our community will show the pressure‐makers what pressure really is; if the ‘gays’ want to shout in the streets, we'll take to the rooftops; and, if they try demonstrations, we'll give them a dayand‐night display of community strength that'll be miles long. And, if they want peace, our terms will be severe; no homosexual teachers in our primary and secondary grades.” Mr. Sousa said he was satisfied with the outcome of the editorial in that “it had achieved its objective.” “We didn't want the homosexuals to come forward and organize, as they apparently have in New York City,” he said. “We wanted to prevent the organization of any homosexual group that would affect our public school teaching system.” He insisted that the editorial was not based on rumor, but on “reports” that he had received “a year ago.” He declined to comment on the “reports” further. In another recent incident involving the Sunday Digest, a group of demonstrators who described themselves as concerned parents disrupted a health fair sponsored by the Huntington Youth Board at Stimson Junior High School. The group of nearly a dozen protestors, described by Mr. Sousa as an ad hoc committee, protested the fair as “sick” in that it included panel discuSsions on teenage sexuality, understanding homosexuality, alcohol and drugs. William C. Farrell, chairman of the Huntington Youth Board, said what bothered him most was that the Sunday Digest “ignored the fair, which drew crowd of 200 parents and their teen‐age children, and covered only the disruption by the protestors,” one of whom was removed by the police and later released. Mr. Farrell added, however, that, the protest appeared to have worked in the youth• board's favor. “Dozens of people have come up to me since the incident, and a Sunday Digest editorial critical of the board. and told me they support the youth program and what it's doing.” “I don't imagine,” he continued, “that had there been no editorial, anyone would have said anything either way.” Other Editorial Stands Mr. Sousa, who has ‘three grown children and lives with his wife in Huntington, said that “when it comes to editorials, we're inclined to do what we want, but on the letters-to-the-editors page, we print both pro and con.” The Sunday Digest has taken editorial stands for the death penalty and against abortion, the Equal Rights Amendment, local taxes, teachers'. unions and flea markets. “We've been called everything from right to left,” said Mr. Sousa. “The Republicans accuse us of being Democrats, the Democrats accuse us of being Republicans, and the leftists called us John Birch and vice versa.” “What we're really basically for,” he said, “is God; country and community.” The Sunday Digest, which has a circulation of 94,459, is owned by Huntington Pennysaver Inc."
Helping Troubled Women in an Era of Change,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/21/archives/helping-troubled-women-in-an-era-of-change-results-of-dizzying.html,"The big black and white banner proclaimed “Women in Crisis Conference.” It prompted a few quips from the men across the hall at a legal semi, nar, but it was anything but a joke to the 1,500 women (and a few men) from 47 states who gathered in New York City for three days last week to tackle women's problems. Alcoholism. Drug abuse. Prostitution, The battered woman. The problems of minority women. The problems of lesbians. The single.mother. The displaced homemaker. Older women. Rape: Incest. Abortion. Depression. Stress. These and othet problems of women, which have been focused upon sporadically since the birth of the women's liberation movement in 1966, were all discussed, debated and dissected at the conference at the Sheraton Centre. It ended Saturday afternoon, ‘after the group passed a resolution condemning “the recent Federal budget cuts, which will affect human services programs.” Jane Velez, the conference administrator, said its purpose was to establish “a national referral network, so that professional people across the country will know what services are available to help women, and where they are.” “Women in Crisis,” billed as the first national gathering of its kind, was sponsored by the Project Return Foundation Inc. and the School of Social Welfare at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, L.I. It drew principally social workers, psychologists and experts in the fields of drug abuse, alcoholism, mental health and the justice system, who work directly with troubled women. Results of ‘Dizzying Change’ Many of them said the problems of American women were being intensified by the changes wrought by the women's liberation movement. “Woman is in a period of crisis today because of the unusual changes she is undergoing,” Eleanor Holmes Norton, commissioner of the United States Equal Opportunity Commission, said in a rousing keynote address. “In a single generation, there has been dizzying change,” she added. “Woman has been converted from housewife to worker. The housewife role has virtually disappeared.” She added that such rapid changes contributed directly to the escalating use of drugs and medication among women; the increase in smoking among teen‐age females when other population groups are cutting down; the increasing crime rates for women and the mounting divorce rate. “We are in a period of role re-definition where stress is inevitable,” Mrs. Norton said, adding that there had been three other “key periods” when women's history changed almost overnight. They involved the early settler woman, the frontier woman and the 1920's postsuffrage woman. The conference featured 116 different workshops, including the popular “Learned Helplessness: How Society Creates the Dependent Woman.” It dealt with women who protect them• selves and get what they want through a facade of learned helplessness, like Blanche Dubois of Tennessee Williams's “A Streetcar Named Desire,” with her famous line, “I've always depended on the kindness of strangers.” Dr. Penelope Russianoff, a Manhattan clinical psychologist who played Jill Clayburgh's therapist in the film “An Unmarried Woman,” said learned helplessness led to such things as depression, overeating, battering, alcoholism, drugs and sexual problems. “Learned helplessness causes a woman to get a fixed idea about herself,” Dr. Russianoff added: “For example, when I was young I thought I was very dumb in math, so I couldn't do it. To unlearn that helpless feeling, one has to set up success in situations where hopelessness is assumed.” This was done for her, she said, when a tutor helped her get 100 percent in a math test. Some Startling Statistics At almost every panel, statistics were mentioned that caused some women in the audience to gasp. Among these: Two‐thirds of patients who seek psychological help are women, yet 90 percent of all psychiatrists’ and 67 percent of all psychologists who treat them are men. One out of every three women sees a professional about mental health problems,, while only one out of seven men does. One out of four women lives on an income of less than $4,000 a year, but one out of 18 men. Four out of every 10 teen‐age girls will become pregnant, and one out of four will keep the child. Female doctors have the highest suicide rate among women, one in every 15 deaths. Women now make up half of this country's estimated 10 or 12 million alcoholics. Women take 50 percent more tranquilizers than men. At a panel on “Women and Stress,” Lois Sigman, a social worker at the Wheeler Clinic in Plainville, Conn., told the audience that stress was “a political problem rather than a medical• problem.” “The caring and nurturing roles of women are exploited, and not given support services,” she said. “Institutions, not women, should have to care for retarded children, disabled husbands and elderly parents.” She added that industries do not take into account the dual roles that women play, which often cause them stress. “We need more flextime jobs, where women can go to work after their children go to school,” she said. “As it is now, the fear of stress‐related diseases often deters women from achievement and upward mobility. They are fearful, so they withdraw.” Helping Alcoholic Mothers There was much discussion at the conference on how to motivate the alcoholic woman to seek help. Nancy G., a recovered alcoholic from Manhattan, said at one workshop that she thought children could be a significant factor in persuading their mothers to stop drinking. She added that her own daughter had brought her into a treatment program. “Children could bring literature home from schools,” Nancy G.. suggested. “They can really get to you, maybe faster than the agencies. They already bring home antismoking literature and say, ‘Don't smoke!’ Why can't they also say, ‘Please don't drink so much?’ “ One of the workshops dealt with a once taboo topic, incest. Social workers from around the country recounted an increasing number of case histories of girls who report being sexually abused by male members of their families. “If we don't move fast, this kind of illness is going to get out of hand,” said Florence Koniski, a nurse and therapist for an incest group at Odyssey House in New York. “In California, they have a pedophilic society, with 2,000 members who want to lower the age of sexual consent to 12.” In a panel on “Strategies to Project Women Into Leadership Roles,” one woman rose in the audience and said in an emotionally distraught voice that it was not good strategy for a woman to tell a male job interviewer that she was not going to marry and have children. “I started doing this because I thought it would help me get a job,” she said. “But then they think you're a lesbian, and the discrimination aginst you is just as powerful as if you were going to leave the corporation to have a child.” At the same panel, Maj Fant, of Sweden's Ministry of Social Affairs, told the audience, “You must stress the father's responsibilty if you want to get ahead in your career. In Sweden, .a woman gets six months off from her job after she has a baby: When she gets pregnant, she says to the man, ‘Are you willing to take half the time off?’ If he says no, she has an abortion, because she doesn't want to stay away from her job that long.” As a result, she said, Sweden's birthrate is dropping, “and men are complaining how victimized they are in their careers.” The conference drew such speakers as Governor Carey, who promised increased protection for New York State's battered wives; Mayor Koch, City Council President Carol Bellamy, former RepresentatiBella S. Abzug, and Representative ester Wolff, who last week established a task force to study women and drug abuse. Opposed Tradition The final speaker, Judge Lisa A. Richette of the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia, drew a standing ovation after she told the audience how she had opposed her family's macho Italian tradition to go to law school and have a career. She said that as a result, she had suffered a midlife depression and had to be hospitalized. “It was caused by guilt — the guilt women in this society are made to feel because of their achievements,” she said. “This is something we have to face.” The New York Times/ Neal Boenzi Dr. Penelope Russianoff, above, clinical psychologist, addresses a conference on “Women in Crisis” at the Sheraton Centre."
Senate Committee Gets Information on Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/22/archives/senate-committee-gets-information-on-abortion.html,"ALBANY, May 21 — The state's Department of Social Services tonight delivered the first round of information that state Senator John J. Marchi, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, had requested for an investigation he is conducting into the way the state administers the money it spends for abortions under Medicaid. Barbara B. Blum, the Social Services Commissioner, said the information included coded lists of providers of Medicaid abortions, but not their names. The Senate voted to eliminate Medicaid funding for aborions in all cases except those involving rape,. incest or the threat of death or severe physical harm to the mother. But the bill faces nearly certain defeat in the Assembly. Mr. Marchi, a Staten Island Republican and an opponent of abortion funding, said he had not had a chance to examine the information provided. “It may be sufficient,” he said. “We may have to go further.” He said his committee had the power to “command” more information if it wanted it."
Letter: On Presidential Tenure,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/23/archives/letter-on-presidential-tenure-no-historic-sanctity-to-the-fouryear.html,"To the Editor: In your editorial (May 12) you call Thomas Jefferson to the stand to testify in favor of “endorsement from the voters” as a significant contribution to the notion that a six‐year Presidential term (without re‐election eligibility) is not prudent. Mr. Jefferson, for all his genius, is not a reliable witness on this issue. In 1805 Mr. Jefferson wrote to his friend John Taylor suggesting that an eightyear term without re‐election eligibility was, to his mind, more suitable. It is true that he, like many of his successors, advocated this revision while he was still President. It is aimless really to recall voices from the past, however great their impress on our history. No single issue (except for the Great Compromise between small states and large states to gain approval for our present House and Senate) so confused and tormented the delegates. On June 13, 1787, the committee of the whole recommended a single seven‐year term and this was approved a second time on July 26. When the document was finally drawn, however, the President had a four‐year term, with eligibility for re‐election. Probably Ben Franklin's insistence on re‐election played a large part in this decision as did the luminous stature of General Washington, who seemed the sure choice to be the first Chief Executive. The delegates were quite prepared to have the General as President for the rest of his life. But the truth is, as one historian put it, “the questions of term, re‐eligibility. and method of election were so thoroughly mixed up that the debates on this resolution read like a running account of a game of three‐dimensional chess.” There is no historic sanctity to the four‐year term. It was a last‐minute choice. Given the radical reshaping of both the Presidency and the society since the birth of the Republic, given the blurring swiftness of instantaneous communication, given the complexities of modern issues (who the hell really understands SALT, snakes, floats, S.D.R.'s monetary fluctuations, energy alternatives?) the single six‐year term in which a President can concentrate his energies and his priorities on trying to solve possibly unsolvable problems without starting to run for re‐election a week after he has been inaugurated, makes formidable sense. More important, perhaps, than Mr. Jefferson's endorsement of a single term is the fact that almost every modern President has held the same views. JACK VALENTI Washington, May 15, 1979 The writer, president of the Motion Picture Association of America. served as special assistant to President Johnson, 1963‐66. Letters Villains and Victims in America's Energy Drama To the Editor: Well, here we go again. The chief villain of the oil‐crisis drama, according to James Reston [May 13], is — the American people. In a very broad sense, the charge may be valid — in the sense that a whole people is shaped in its patterns of work, life and consciousness by the economic system and the few who control it. Most of us pretty much take life as it is given to us by others. For example, destroy local mass‐transit systems, promote suburban sprawl through every governmental and private incentive, permit central cities to deteriorate into jungles and stimulate the automotive industry by every advertising trick known to man, and what do you get? A spread‐out network of settlement, Work, distribution and consumption which has become absolutely dependent on the automobile for Whom do we have to thank for all this? We can ba a little more specific than “the American people,” can't we? Is our memory so short that we forget the lavish television commer cials produced by the oil companies as late as 1973 urging all of us to consume, consume, consume? Do we forget that as late as the very end of 1973 the President of the United States was saying, “We use 30 percent of all the energy .... That isn't bad; that is good. That means that we are the richest, strongest people in the world and that we have the highest standard of living in the world. That is why we need so much energy, and may it always be that way”? (Nixon to the Seafarers International Union, Washington, Nov. 26, 1973.) The hegemonic corporate interests and the political leadership which so often speaks and acts for them have led the whole country into a frightful dead end since World War II. No doubt they did this with the full consent and acquiescence of the American people. Ultimately they did so because capitalism — whatever else it may be —places every incentive on taking the short view rather than the long, optimizing profits rather than planning. and insuring the supremacy of individual self‐interest over the “national in terest.” The law of least effort has dominated. It has led us to the verge of a gigantic national tragedy. How easy it is to blame “the American people” for all this when the piper at last has to be paid! For then it becomes unnecessary to think about the implications of the fact that the American dream is about over. The costs of the transition to something else will be agonizingly high. If the political system is not to blow up under the strain, these costs will have to be apportioned with some pretense to equity. Our leaders, not just in politics but in the opinion media and elsewhere, appear almost wholly unaware of the implications or requirements of this equity. This despite the fact that “equality of sacrifice” is always an essential ingredient of the modern wars with which our bien‐pensants so often compare the energy crisis. The people at large are quite intelligent enough to realize this, and to realize that “their” leaders are now expecting them to pick up the costs while otherwise business as usual is the order of the day. Socialize costs, privately appropriate the profits — that is the whole story. Some of us also realize that equitable apportionment of costs cannot even begin until an informed debate on the transformation begins. Framing this debate is an essential responsibility of leadership, in the media no less than among elected politicians. Five years after the 1973 oil embargo, it can only be said that this leadership has failed its responsibility. Nor can the responsibility be met by pundits who blame the American people for doing what their leaders and their corporate giants had told them to do, decade after decade. (Prof.) WALTER DEAN BURNHAM Dept. of Political Science, M.I.T. Cambridge, Mass., May 13,1979 Stop the Panic and Supply Atomic Power To the Editor: The events at Three Mile Island gave rise to a six‐month halt in permits for energy plant construction. A potentially far greater danger is indicated in your report of May 13 of phosphate‐radiation peril to 2,000 people in Florida homes and to people in 200,000 houses elsewhere. Shouldn't we ban for six months all building permits everywhere pending evaluation of this new radiation hazard? Problems like this, the Love Canal's, Reserve Mining's and numerous others lead to the inescapable logic that all home construction should be banned on any site that either never had a house on it or, if it had, was at any time inhabited by anyone who contracted cancer or any other disease not specifically traced to nonenvironmental sources. We are not being panicked by these hazards, and we should stop our panic over atomic energy hazards. We need atomic energy, and we should resume construction immediately. MILTON ROTHSTEIN East Williston, L.I., May 19, 1979 Safe From Radiation — and From Abortion To the Editor: California Governor Brown's May 6 speech before the anti‐nuclear rally in Washington sounded similar to a rightto‐life oration. In calling for “a new politics — a politics of the future that represents the unborn, the undreamed of, the unimagined generation,” Governor Brown issued a clarion call that applies equally to unborn Americans who are and would be killed by abortion as well as those who would be injured by nuclear radioactivity. In our national effort to assure that unborn Americans will live in safety from the danger of the nukes, we must first guarantee that they are born safe from abortion. But make no mistake, we Americans will do this. By closing abortion mills, defeating pro‐abortion candidates and enacting the human life amendment to the Constitution, we will provide for unborn Americans the “legal” right to life, which must exist before there can be any meaningful “legal” right to life free from nuclear fallout. JEROME W. COX Westboro, Mass., May 9, 1979 Arms or Affluence To the Editor: Irving Kahn, in his May 15 letter, gives Professor Galbraith a “C minus” in economics. Mr. Kahn, I regret to say, gets an “F.” He forgot to mention that Germany, Japan and Switzerland (which he cites as countries with “little inflation and strong currencies” where the state “lets the market system compete”) also happen to be the principal industrialized nations that do not spend gross amounts of their national wealth on ar maments. CHARLOTTE F. SAFIR New York, May 15, 1979 Youths vs. ‘Nukes’ To the Editor: Contrary to what the media would have unsuspicious folks think, not all youths in the May 6 rally against nuclear power were seeking to experience a 1960's‐type demonstration. I think it unfair and unnecessary of the media to compare the anti‐nuke movement to the antiwar movement. The issue of nuclear power has not become the substitute cause of the 1970's. For many serious reasons youths oppose nuclear power; reliving the 60's, how ever, is not one. NATALIE CHAPIN Marblehead, Mass., May 10, 1979 What English Lessons Offer Mrs. Mendoza To the Editor: Your view of Mrs. Mendoza's plight [editorial May 8] is essentially shortsighted. Mrs. Mendoza needs more than Spanish‐speaking welfare workers. have worked with many of “Mrs. Mendoza's children,” both as an assistant professor of remedial composition in a local community college and as a vocational rehabilitation counselor. These young people are disabled by a lack of the basic skills that make life useful and satisfying in our society. Among them are the use of the English language — the recognition of English words and their primary meanings, their synonyms and antonyms, and the ability to organize them into logical sentences and paragraphs — and the ability to relate to their parents as mentors and guides. Mrs. Mendoza is unable to communicate with welfare workers. That is serious enough. What is tragic is that she cannot communicate with her own children and offer them — in a way they will respect — emotional, intellectual and social nurture. Your editorial would have been more useful had its tone been less belligerent and more constructive. Yes, we need translators and interpreters in welfare offices. But Mrs. Mendoza, to understand and to be understood, direly needs a course in English as a second language — offered eagerly and free of cost in many places throughout the city. With this she might well be able not only to deal with her own immediate needs but also to become an “insider,” a functioning member of the society in which she has chosen to live. MYRA S. WALDINGER Flushing, N.Y., May 10, 1979 Another Perspective on the Bus Shelter Controversy To the Editor: In the lead editorial “A Helter‐Skelter Shelter Mess” (May 14), The Times made comment on a matter presently before the courts and in a manner which may influence the outcome of pending litigation. The editorial failed totally to place the facts of the bus shelter controversy — which have become warped beyond belief by the persistent and vicious public relations campaign of the former franchisee, BusTop Shelters, Inc. — in their true context. The only offense of which Convenience & Safety Corp. is guilty is that of having publicly offered to the City of New York, through open competitive bidding, the greatest amount of revenues and the highest number of shelters of any of the eight original applicants for the bus shelter franchise or any of the four final bidders. Not an inkling of this appeared in your editorial. There was no suggestion that the Board of Estimate had unanimously chosen to award the franchise to C&S only when we submitted a proposal 500 percent better in terms of revenues and 300 percent better in terms of numbers of shelters than that of BusTop and because we alone, of all bidders, offered to build shelters in the populous boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens. None of these facts emerges from the editorial. BusTop, whose authorization to remain on city streets terminated Sept. 26, 1978, has remained on city property illegally, in open defiance of the unanimous mandate of the Board of Estimate that it comply with the terms of its long‐expired contract and either sell the shelters to the city for depreciated book value or remove them. The prospect of removal of the existing shelters, about which so much has been written with so little accura cy, has arisen only because of BusTop's failure to honor its contract, not because of any vindictive desire to demolish what all agree is a desirable amenity. Why, the editorial asks, is the city hurrying to force BusTop to yield management of the shelters it built since. the editorial alleges, the city derives the same income from BusTop that it would from its “rival”? BusTop is paying the city at the rate of $41,667 per month while C&S has offered to pay the city $126,000 per month to operate the same shelters. Is this the same income? Finally, there is the “issue” of the investigations. Despite the unwarranted innnuendo of the editorial, I have no knowledge of the circumstances behind the recent vandalism. To this I am fully prepared to testify, just as C&S has long been willing to provide information as to other matters which are said to require investigation. We welcome the opportunity to answer questions asked of us, but for reasons entirely unclear, no inquiry has been put. HENRY R. SILVERMAN President, Convenience & Safety Corp. New York, May 18, 1979 Unsettled Foreign Claims To the Editor: It is gratifying to read that American citizens will get compensation for nationalized properties in China. Isn't it time that claims for nationalized properties in Czechoslovakia were also finally settled? There are only about 20 percent of the claimants still alive (the youngest over 70 years of age). Are the authorities waiting for the demise of the rest of them? FRANK JUSTIC Kew Gardens. N.Y., May 11, 1979"
"Advice to Girls, Then and Now",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/23/archives/advice-to-girls-then-and-now-advice-to-girls-then-and-now.html,"THE faded little book caught her eye one day in the biology classroom, where it was wedged among others on a shelf. Curious, she started leafing through it. Soon she and her fellow 14‐year‐olds were hooting with laughter. First published in 1959, it was called “On Becoming a Woman,” and to them it read like a relic of another civilization. “They had certain costumes you had to wear,” marveled the teen‐ager, a ninth‐grader who lives in Manhattan and wears blue jeans to most parties. “It goes on and on about a navy blue sheath as a fundamental part of how you're supposed to dress! And the whole structure of the date, all the rituals of it — it's so different for us now! And there was all this stuff about never calling a boy on the telephone. I feel totally free to call a boy; it doesn't make me feel awkward to be more aggressive. The whole thing about how girls were supposed to wait by the phone is just not the way it is.” In addition to the specific mores of another era, however, she was struck by the larger implications of what she read. “At first I thought it was all very funny,” she mused. “But when I stopped to think about it, and the whole idea of pleasing the boy that runs all the way through it, I started getting kind of angry. There were all these lists of things on how you should please a boy, and nothing about how a boy did anything for you — as if was your duty just to please, and boys didn't have those duties, only girls.” The little book, written by Mary McGee Williams and Irene Kane and published by the Dell Publishing Company, concluded with a chapter called “It's Not Too Soon Dream of Marriage” (“After going steady,” the authors wrote, “comes marriage, if life is to proceed in an orderly fashion, and it generally does.”). The book went through 17 printings and sold hundreds of thousands of copies over the years. An entire generation of young women were influenced by it and others like it: Books that presented the basic facts of life and discussions of dating and sex, but mixed the information with heavy doses of cultural conditioning about how to be a successful female in American society. In dealing with boys, this feat was generally accomplished through passivity, albeit a passivity strategically bolstered by manipulative wiles. “No one would dare print something like that now,” the 14‐year‐old remarked. “Things have really changed.” And although standards of behavior may vary widely — and some would contend that, despite appearances, Social values haven't changed that much in the last two decades — books and articles offering advice to teen‐agers are very different from those of the 1950's. “It's fascinating to look at how attitudes have changed over the years in books on sex for teen‐agers,” commented Joyce Yaeger, director of information and education for Planned Parenthood in New York. “Anybody who's writing in this field has had to be responsive to the things the women's movement has made us aware of. It's sensitized the rest of society to how we talk about what boys and girls are supposed to be, and how they're supposed to behave.” Twenty years ago, issues of the magazine Seventeen were full of advice columns that interspersed their wisdom (“In dating, like dancing, a boy likes to take the lead; a girl's role, traditionally, is to follow.”) with such fashion features as “How to Look Delightfully Demure.” Young women were told that marriage was the most important thing in a woman's life, preparing oneself to be a good wife the crucial goal; to that end, they were provided with helpful hints from the first date on. “If possible, don't talk about yourself,” admonished one column emphasizing the standard how‐to's on charming adolescent boys into witty conversation about car engines and other passions. Chastity was a constant theme: “Boys will only respect and admire you if you say no,” warned articles on teenage sex. Taking the initiative in any way, from ordering for oneself in a restaurant to such cardinal sins as telephoning a boy, was taboo. Today, however, such publications present a dramatically different world of possibilities. In a recent issue of Seventeen, a girl describing herself as “super‐shy” wrote to ask, “How can get Joey to take the initiative?” The reply would have appalled earlier advisers. “This is an opportunity for you to be the assertive one for a change,” the columnist wrote enthusiasically. “We think it's not at all out of place for a girl to be assertive . . . It's a lot more womanly and honest to show the affection you feel than to scheme to make him take the initiative.” Another article presented the results of a reader survey showing that less than half the girls (41 percent) say they'd like to remain virgins until they marry. According to Seventeen's executive editor, Ray Robinson, the magazine — whose circulation is around 1.5 million, primarily among the 13‐to‐17year‐old age group — receives a constant barrage of letters on such subjects as teen‐age pregnancy and abortion. And a booklet the magazine sends out on request, called “Dating, Relating and Sex,” offers straightforward information on birth control and venereal disease, along with answers to such pressing questions as, “How do you kiss?” Twenty years ago, as far as sex was concerned, said Miss Yaeger, the approach was “heavily moralistic — basi cally, the books said, don't do it, it's bad for you.” For girls, the message was particularly strong: “The overall tone for books up through the 1950's was the your‐body‐is‐a‐temple kind of thing,” said Marcia Lawrence, a Planned Parenthood consultant currently writing a book for teen‐agers. In the 1960's, Miss Lawrence continued: “They introduced the idea that there was such a thing as sex which people actually enjoyed apart from creating babies. But there was still this talking‐through‐clenched‐teeth sense that we must not let you have any impression that this is really nice, because you are not to be trusted not to run off and do it in the streets. And then in the early 70's there was a third genre, really a wave of the counterculture: O.K. kids, this is how you should do it, this is what it should feel like, these are some experiments you can try. “And that,” Miss Lawrence concluded with a rueful laugh, “was not quite ‘it’ either.” These days, according to Miss Lawrence, authors like herself “try to keep to physical information which is relatively culture‐free.” “We are not trying to attach a value to doing it or not doing it,” she said. “We're trying to present sex as a natural part of life, which is ideally supposed to enhance people's lives, and whether or not it does that depends on the conditions under which you choose to have it.” The orientation toward sex as something a girl gives and a boy takes, thereby diminishing or degrading her, is usually seen today as a bias to be avoided. “The approach now is more egalitarian: boys and girls should have equal rights and equal opportunities,” explained Sol Gordon, a prominent author of sex books for teen‐agers and director of the Institute for Family Research and Education at Syracuse University. Miss Lawrence added: “There is less of a sense that the girl is the one who says how far things will go — the custodian‐standing‐at‐the‐gate‐defendingthe‐Holy‐Grail thing. By presenting the same values and decision‐making materials to both boys and girls, you're saying, ‘you both have to think about some things; we're in this together.’” Nevertheless, not everyone agrees that the kind of sex‐role stereotyping that used to be almost universal was wholly negative phenomenon. “I think if you started society all over again, the stereotypes would build up again exactly the way they are,” said Louise Bates Ames, associate director of the Gesell Institute. Dr. Ames, a child psychologist, wrote a glowing introduction to “On Becoming a Woman” more than 20 years ago, and she for one is not so sure that times have changed as drastically as others might claim. “I still personally feel that the smartest girls don't call up boys and ask for dates,” Dr. Ames said. “Things are not absolutely even between the sexes. I think men still like to be the ones to do the major part of the pursuing, and if girls are going to do it they have to be pretty subtle about it. The old notions still predominate.” Many sex educators acknowledge that despite their own belief in the importance of nonsexist information, they must also take into account society's remaining biases. In dealing with teenage sex and pregnancy, reported Dr. Gordon, “I place a stronger emphasis on the girl's responsibility, because we still have a double standard.”"
Hers,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/24/archives/hers.html,"WHEN I hear a small hand picking out “Fiir Elise” on the piano in that muzzy hour before dinner is laid cm the table, as once my own hand did, I begin to believe that I may have stumbled into a continuum. When I see a stance, a toss of hair and thrust of chin as once I tossed and thrust, I feel that I may have made a perpetual motion. And when I hear adolescent accusa. tions of my “foreignness,” as once my own mouth spoke them,! think that I may have gotten a jump on science and cloned myself. That I did not, or would rot, recognize my parents in myself, and therefore did DM anticipate what I see in my children, is probably not relevant. Better now than not at all. Science and art apart, I guess there are two kinds of continuity. One makes generational music and the other doesn't, being the length, say, of just one life's shadow falling on grass that no one may remember to cut. Yesterday I went to visit the old lady who introduced me to the man who fathered the beings whose actions seem to imitate my own. Madame R. admits to 95, is not senile, and has outlived all her contemporaries. That's one sort of continuity. As we drank tea from cups no less cracked than her skin, Madame told me her stories. Four husbands in all those years makes a substantial history, one that parallels Poland's. Two husbands Madame discarded and two died. A woman of independent means and spirit, Madame just kept on marrying to suit herself. Being born in 1884 precluded any frame of sexual reference for ladies but a matrimonial one, so in that sense Madame was fulfilling her cultural obligations. But in another way she was singularly at odds with her era, more in step with ours. Madame never wanted children although, she tells me, there was no ovarian impediment to such production. The reasons for not having children have escaped her now, she says, but there were reasons at the time. Madame has few visitors, at her age, and few connections any more. I am always struck, when I see her, by the shabby finality that hovers like the dust in her rooms, waiting to be wiped once and for all. August Ferdinand Miibius, lecturing to the French Academy about geometrical transformations in space, demonstrated the properties of something we knew today as a Möbius strip. He took one end of a rectangular piece of paper, turned it 180 degrees on its longitudinal axis, and fastened it, twisted so, to its other end, thereby creating a continuous and onesided surface. He called his new science topology. I call it astute and I can do what old Miibius did. I had children, thereby creating a continuum, although I didn't see its curve for quite a while. I had children instinctively, rather like an animal. There was scarcely a decision involved. As to time, yes, but not as to fact. Those were my cultural imperatives and I cannot say I minded them. Having children was like breathing; you did it if you could. It was essential and, secretly, so delicious. That sweet suckling dependence, the measure of importance that even a tiny body imparted to your life, O the bath and the powder of it, O destiny! I loved it. Now, love is not all I feel for my children or about having them. I feel history. You don't hear too many people saying they feel history these days, and I suppose there are reasons for that. It is not hard to see that we live man age of “diminishing expectations,” as Christopher Leach has recently called it. What should we expect, after all, from a world so transmogrified and politicized, so polluted, sntrivially personal? The ethic of “mei ” has been given a green light by the media and its dubious mouthpieces, celebrities all. As for the selfawareness movement, looking inward is said to be slightly less boring than looking outward at everybody else looking inward. We have lapsed, tediously, into a lifeway that is insatiable and indulgent, as shallow and ephemeral as the puddle on a windowsill in May. In a lifeway like airs, children are little more than fallout, the byproduct of two energetic selves exploding like two Roman candles, bright but not warm, not particularly lasting, not particularly connected beyond that minute's flare. The sexual revolution, divorce, legal abortion and urbanization have taken care of our connections, severed and nullified so many of them. Skinship is hardly kinship and proximity breeds nothing very much. It is trim that children are knotty and intrusive, a high‐risk, high‐decibel‐level business mice the powder and baths are over. Children between the ages of 11 and 18 extrude unpleasantness from every orifice for most of the time they spend in your house, eyes especially. But because I have stumbled into a continuum, I wouldn't have it any other way. I am extended; I see beyond temporary intrusions. I see that children are‐along with being many other thingsvehicles for an important trip into time. As such, they must carry certain baggage that I must give to them. Baggage that is more than gesture, heavier than my hand reaching, spanning, across who knows how many years to tuck a slack strand of hair behind an ear. The baggage I have in mind is grander; it has a natural permanence; it is worth taking along. What I must give to my children is a value structure that will last and last. Just for starters, it will have to last longer than the society we live in, which seems to be rapidly self‐destructing, sending out nothing but mixed messages about itself that don't always sound like an S.O.S. to me. It is the natural order of things to spawn, to span. Animal, vegetable, mineral: all spawn, all span. Even a glacier calves as I did, mothering bergy bits, ambient chunks that float, strike, and float again on a deep and possible sea. It is the natural order of man to multiply. That's the easy part. The difficult part may accamt for Madame R s barren decisions, for many of the deliberately empty nests we see today. As we expect less, so do we try less, owe less. Because our lifeway has institutionalized contradiction, we live in a swamp of confusion: pleasurable, maybe, but self‐defeating. What we must do for our children, for ourselves, is to sidestep out of that confusion. Sidestepping is not an evasion but a discovery, an ongoing and historical affirmation of verities that are, still, eternal and must continue to be 90. The alternative to history is extinction. It is difficult but not impossible for me ,to twist like IL Möbius strip, turning my bead and my body away from the shifty currents of that dismal swamp, turning my children in a forward direction, away from self‐defeat, away from mere self.

"Abortion, the City and the Church",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/25/archives/abortion-the-city-and-the-church.html,"New York City now faces what looks like a particularly acute dilemma over abortion. The city plans to sign a $24‐million contract between New York Medical College and two city hospitals that would be served by the college. The problem, in brief, is that the college is affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, which opposes abortion, but city hospitals must, as a matter of public policy, provide abortion services. However, the dilemma may not be as difficult as it looks. Some people conclude from recent anti‐abortion statements by the Archdiocese of New York that the Medical College will be bound by the church's position to interfere with the provision of abortion services at the two city hospitals, Lincoln in the Bronx and Metropolitan in Manhattan. Indeed, the Medical College owes its existence to the Archdiocese, which has been helping the school extricate itself from severe managerial and financial problems. In return, the church was allowed to appoint 20 of the college's 30 board members and all five members of the group that will appoint future boards. Nonetheless, the Archdiocese says the college remains independent and is free to choose its own abortion policy. The Health and Hospitals Corporation accepts this position and expects the college to provide abortions under the new contract with the city. If the college does not, the corporation has a contingency plan to hire outside physicians to perform abortions. Such outside staffing is common in other city hospital services. Critics of the city's plan, like Planned Parenthood, believe such a dual abortion system would inevitably fail. They fear that physicians associated with the Medical College would not direct patients to the abortion service provided by the city. So they think the Health and Hospitals Corporation should find another affiliate. That course seems premature. There is no way now to judge whether the city's contingency plan would work — or even if it would ever be needed. It would be preferable to sign the contract with New York Medical College as planned and monitor it carefully. The city will know soon enough whether the Medical College serves the Archdiocese, the city or both."
Disabled Women: A Conference on Discrimination,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/25/archives/disabled-women-a-conference-on-discrimination-to-effect-change.html,"Marilyn Saviola, a quadraplegic polio victim, told a conference here yesterday that disabled women who are striving to be independent are caught in a “double bind” of discrimination. “First is society's traditional sex role for woman, which carries with the assumption that she is dependent economically and socially,” she said. “The other is the fact that her disability makes it necessary for her to be physically dependent on someone else to assist her in managing one or more major life functions.” Miss Saviola, who works as a rehabilitation counselor at Goldwater Memorial Hospital and who is president of a 200‐member group called Disabled in Action, was one of several handicapped women who spoke at the day‐long conference, believed to be the first of its kind in the city to focus on the problems of the disabled woman. It was sponsored by the New York City Commission on the Status of Women and the Mayor's Office for the Handicapped. ‘To Effect Change’ “Our goal is to effect change,” said Sandra Schnur, the conference coordinator, who is director of New York City's Half‐Fare Program for the Handicapped. Miss Schnur, who is confined to wheelchair because of polio, said she had no idea how‐many disabled women lived in New York City beause such statistics were unavailable. “The guesstimate is that one out of nine men and women of all ages in the city are disabled,” she said, adding that the nationwide figure was 36 million. Miss Saviola, who had to pause occasionally as she delivered her testimony from her wheelchair to breathe air from a respirator tube, told the audience that among the “many barriers” a disabled woman faces is the anger, fear and guilt of her family members if she decides to move out of the family home and live in her own apartment. “It is hard for many families to conceive that their disabled loved one, especially a woman, wants to be independent and self‐directing like other people.” she said. “They rationalize, ‘I must take care of them, they need me.’ As a result, parents often believe they have the right to keep the child at home and childlike through adulthood.” Other Barriers Mentioned She mentioned other barriers, many of them shared by disabled men. They include the high cost of private transportation to jobs for disabled women, “upwards of $100 a week;” the lack of accessible public transportation; the lack of barrier‐free and affordable apartments; and the frequent need for personal care attendants to do the disabled woman's shopping, cooking and cleaning and tend to her personal hygiene. Several women at the conference noted that because personal care attendants cost as much as $10,000 year, many disabled women in New York City quit their jobs and live on Supplemental Security Income payments of $280 month. so they will become eligible for personal care attendants paid for by Medicaid. The 125 persons in the audience included administrators and managers of Federal, state and local governmental agencies that deal with the disabled, as well as legislative aides, personnel managers, educators, and college counselors of handicapped students. They were told that only 29 percent of all disabled women hold paying jobs. with only a “minuscule” number of them earning over $10,000; that a recent job study showed that handicapped men have more status than handicapped women; that most handicapped women survive on the $280 a month they get from S.S.I.; and that many employable handicapped women have stopped looking for work altogether because they are “discouraged” by the lack of opportunities and the financial penalties. Maria Nardone, a 32‐year‐old blind student who will graduate in June from the New York University of Social’ Work, told the audience about “insensitive” college professors who refused to let her tape record their lectures, and others who would write notes on the blackboard and refer to them constantly during their lectures without letting her know what they were talking about. “In four years of college, only one professor came up to me and said, ‘Do you get what I'm writing on the board? If you need help, come to me after class,’ ” she said, in an emotional tone, Miss Nardone, whose guide dog, Vista, dozed at her feet as she spoke, recommended that educators should begin teaching children about disabled people at a young age, and that courses on the disabled should be included in more college curriculums. Dr. Freida Zames, an assistant professor of mathematics at the New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark, told how difficult it was for her to find job in her field, even though she had graduated magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from Brooklyn College in 1959. Dr. Zames wears leg braces and walks with crutches because of polio. “Disabled women are considered helpless children unable to do the job,” she said. “We are thought of as asexual when it comes to jobs like secretary, receptionist or model, but we are thought of as sexual when intelligence and drive are required.” Several of the speakers said the women's movement had been slow in recognizing the problems of disabled women. The first time the movement seemed to pay any attention to them was at the National Women's Conference in Houston in November 1977, they said. Miss Schnur, coordinator of yesterday's conference, explained the tardiness this way: “Women who are not disabled are socialized in the same manner as all people in society. They feel threatened by us, and see us as asexual, the same biases that the rest of the population has. As a result, they didn't include us or look for our support on things like equal rights, abortion and credit — issues that are very important to us.” Veterans Get Priority Miss Schnur added that she thought most rehabilitation programs were biased toward wounded war veterans. “The people in rehabilitation have the idea that the easy way to rehabilitate disabled woman is as a homemaker,” she said. “They say, ‘Why spend the money when it's an accepted role for her to be a homemaker?” The conference, which was divided into three discussion areas — employment, education and eligibility requirements — drew a number of speakers from the agencies that work with disabled women. One of them, John Devine, regional administrator of the Office of Human Development Services of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, brought 10 H.E.W. managers along with him. Mr. Devine said he felt “an awareness” in H.E.W. of the points being made at the conference, and of the “double discrimination toward handicapped women.” “This is an issue that makes us realize the vulnerability of us all,” he said. “There is a very thin line between the handicapped and the nonhandicapped. Just the other day, I got a phone call that my counterpart in Philadelphia had just suffered a massive coronary, and will be dependent on the rehabilitation services of the very system we are trying to reform.”"

HOMECOMING FORTHE POPE,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/27/archives/homecoming-for-the-pope-the-pope.html,"The powerful, slightly stooped figure in gold stitched white robes, his skullcap ever so rakishly askew, advances unhurriedly through the adoring throng, radiating energy and vitality, a magnetic, irresistible current of warmth and contagious good humor. He is enveloped by a friendly pandemonium: delighted cries of “Viva ii Papa!” bursts of applause, happy laughter, spontaneous song; arms and hands are outstretched to touch the man, his vestments, to feel blessed by the closeness, the contact. They are shoulder to shoulder, nearly 20,000 pilgrims from all over the globe — many of them young people — and they pack the Vatican's huge Aula Paolo VI hall, a modernistic edifice to the left of St. Peter's Basilica. Poland's Karol Jozef Wojtyla, who has been Pope John Paul II since last October, is working the crowd with the ease of a natural politician. He displays an unerring sense of drama as he stops to chat with a woman here, a child there, to crack a joke, to shake hands with a pilgrim on the edge of the crowd. Everyone is all smiles, and this clearly is not a solemn religious ceremony but a joyous occasion for the Pope and the faithful as well. Tad Szulc is a Washington writer who has often visited Poland, most recently while working on this article. The spectacle I watched was John Paul ll's third consecutive public audience on a pre‐Easter Wednesday. He had been at it since 9 o'clock that morning, first in a Vatican garden, then at St. Peter's; it was the afternoon when he finally reached the raised stage at Aula Paolo VI to sit in a great armchair — not a throne — to deliver a short homily in Italian, a homily that he then summarized in six other lanIn his strong, clear voice — the trained voice of the actor he once was — the Pope deplored the fact that we still live in the kind of a world where alms must be given the poor, and insisted that it be done from the heart. The words were the expression of the humanistic concerns this quasi‐populist Pontiff who is already an impressive, refreshing and controversial presence on the world scene. He is at once man of profound personal mysticism as well as an extroverted social philosopher, a teacher of Christian ethics, a lyrical poet, and one of this generation's most prolific theological and philosophical writers. Only at the age of 26 did he enter the priesthood, after spending four years as a poverty‐stricken laborer during the Nazi occupation of Poland, but the vocation and the mysticism were always in him, along with the buoyant humor and the love of theater and sports. He is a man of many dimensions and complexities, this 264th successor of St. Peter at the head of the deeply divided and problem‐ridden Roman Catholic Apostolic Church.

If there is a common denominator among all these elements of his personality, it is John Paul II's utter obsession with the terrestrial destiny and dignity of the human being. He speaks infrequently of the hereafter, or of the immortal soul: it is man on earth, always man, who concerns him — man's human rights, his mental processes, and his sexuality and sensuality in the context of holy matrimony. It is this concern, more than the rigidity he has thus far displayed on questions of dogma, that in the end defines the new Pope as a philosophical and intellectual populist [see box, on Page 48, where the Pope describes why he became Despite a reign measured in months, his popularity is rising, a phenomenon that is certain to be accentuated when, next Saturday, he undertakes an eightday visit to his native Poland. “Going ome,” as he puts it, was one of John Paul II's first commitments after the papal election.

Therefore a diplomatic formula was ironed out, under which John Paul II was invited by the Polish episcopate, while the Warsaw Government simply stated its “satisfaction” over the Pope's acceptance of that invita- After observing John Paul II in action in Rome, I spent two weeks in Poland, and came away with the impression that the June pilgrimage is certain to be one of the most significant and emotion‐laden events in the postwar history of that country, where more than 90 percent of the population is of the Roman Catholic faith. Fifteen million Poles, almost half the nation's population, are expected to turn out to hail him; if nothing else, the visit will be crowd‐handling and logistical nightmare. The regime, which senselessly censored the Pope's Christmas message to his former Cracow archdiocese, has been discouraging organized school and group excursions to greet the Pope, but such efforts are unlikely to make Thousands of Poles, I learned, were arranging to take their annual vacation during the Pope's stay to see him. In the villages, peasants were cleaning up and painting their horse‐drawn carts for the occasion. And in the cities, enterprising people who were lucky enough to live along John Paul II's presumed route were selling window space to catch a glimpse of him for the equivalent of 81,000 per person. 0 Looking at this exuberant Pope at the audience in Rome gave me a measure of the impact of his personality. It was P.M., and the Pontiff recited the Pater Nester, winding up the formal proceedings by joking that “finally, we can all go and have dinner.” There was appreciative laughter — earlier he had commented that “the Pope is making progress; he's learning to arrive on time” — and the crowd began to shuffle out of the ball. He bad charmed them thoroughly, as I had seen him do in Poland when we first met nearly two years ago. But the Pope still tarried behind, conversing expansively with invited guests in the front row, who bowed to kiss his ring; in Polish, be playfully exhorted this American reporter to “write well” about him in the article he was preparing. The blue eyes twinkled and the open, pink-cheeked face crinkled in a mischievous grin. The Pope was relaxed and visibly unfatigued, although he had been up since 5 A.M., as he is every morning, praying, writing and receiving private visitors at his apartment before embarking on the six hours of public audiences. Ahead of him was busy afternoon and evening, but John Paul II craves human rapport. In his immediate presence one is aware of Karol Wojtyla's sense of absolute enjoyment in serving‐his word as the spiritual leader of the world's 700 million Roman Catholics, an estimated 18 percent of humanity. For him, the Papacy is not the burden it seemed to be for Albino Cardinal Luciani, the gentle Venetian who reigned as John Paul for 33 days last year before dying of a massive heart attack. As I was told recently by a Western European cardinal who participated in both 1978 elections, Luciani appeared “crushed” when he was asked the ritual question, “Do you accept?” Cardinal Wojtyla could hardly wait to give his answer. As votecounters in the Sistine Chapel on the late afternoon of Oct. 16 were announcing to the Sacred College of Cardinals the outcome of the balloting, the new Pope was busy scribbling in his perfect Latin his resonant response: “With obedience in faith to Christ, my Lord, and with trust in the Mother of Christ and the Church, in spite of great difficulties, I accept!” Those who know Pope John Paul II well, especially his Polish friends with whom I talked at length in Rome, Warsaw and Cracow, are convinced that the Pope deeply believes that his God‐given mission is to lead the badly troubled Catholic Church into the third millenium of Christendom as a revivified institution, fully in tune with the modern world. This, of course, is a formidable enterprise. Keenly aware of the split be- tween liberals and conservatives in the church the Pope used his January visit to Mexico to play a mediator's role over the “theology of liberation” at the conference of ‐Latin American Bishops. He knows that many Catholics have been turning away from the church; he also knows that fewer and fewer Catholics are turning to the priesthood, Poland being one of the few exceptions. In Latin America, for example, priests must be imported from the United States and Europe; between 1972 and 1975, the number of priests in the world dropped by 9.5 percent. Still, his friends say, John Paul II has his own vision of the future, and of himself as a modern pope. He intends, they say, to attempt a broad reconciliation of the diverging views in the church, and to revitalize the institution through his active pastoral involvement. The Pope has not spelled out his strategy it obviously has to be a very long‐term plan — for revitalizing the Catholic Church. Still, experienced Vatican observers and the Pope's own friends believe it will be a gradual process, in which his ability to act as a persuader and a conciliator among those with contending views will be tested. John Paul II realizes that he cannot arrest evolution in the modern church. His accent is on pastoral work, and he evidently hopes this will be one of the most important elements in the delicate balancing act he must perform. And, of course, self‐assured as he is, the Pope must count on the sheer force of his personal- He understands the disappointment of numerous Catholics over his conservative stand on such matters as abortion, the celibacy of priests, and divorce and remarriage. But he is said to feel that the church requires internal discipline to survive; he sees no conflict between his liberal humanist instincts and his stern attitude on the practice of religion. For similar reasons — unlike Paul VI — he has so far refused all petitions to release priests from their vows. “This is a matter of conscience with him,” a friend who deplores the Pope's apparent inflexibility told me one evening in Cracow. Others do not exclude the possibility that there will be an evolution in the Pope's thinking. At 59, as the youngest Pope in 132 years and a man in splendid physical shape, he is expected to be at the helm of the church for a long time. Despite his outward activism. John Paul II. a superb politician, tends to proceed cautiously on crucial matters. However, when he does act, his friends say, he is not subject to outside influ- An example of this was the Pontiff's refusal to make any major appointments in the Roman Curia — the governing bureaucracy of the Vatican during his first six and a half months on St. Peter's throne. This insistence ran counter to the practice of most of his predecessors, and I heard bishops in Rome complaining about it in private. It took John Paul 11 six weeks to decide on a new Vatican Secretary of State after the post, the most powerful position in the Curia, was vacated in March with the death of Jean Cardinal Villot. But when the Pope named the Italian Archbishop Agostino Casaroli to be Pro‐Secretary (the acting secretary, pending his anticipated elevation to Cardinal), it came as quite a surprise to many Vatican‐watchers. Cesar°li had long been identified with the church's own brand of Ostpolitik, the policy of a hard‐bargaining dialogue with Communist regimes in Eastern Europe, and the conventional Vatican wisdom was that John Paul II, as a Pole, might not have wished to appear to be using his Polishness to emphasize this policy. But coming as it did on the eve of his Polish trip, the Pope appeared to be using the designation of Casaroli, the architect of Osipolttik, to signal his intention of pursuing the policy so long as the Communists remain prepared to be responsive. A week later, he appointed Paolo Cardinal Bertoli, another Italian, to be Chamberlain, filling a key post that Villot also held. By thus dividing what were Villot's responsibilities, the Pope was deemed to be prudently diffusing the Curia's power. There is, however, consensus on one point: This tough‐minded and stubborn Pole, graced with intellect and charisma, seems certain to leave an indelible mark on the church as well as on the world at large. In only short time he has established himself as a dominant personality, and not only among Catholics. At a time of yearning everywhere for a sense of faith and morality, some hope that the Pope may fill the need for a source of moral influence in international affairs. Emerging from a Polish Communist setting, John Paul II seems certain to play a significant role in the evolution of East‐West relationships as he is increasingly active in foreign affairs. His visit to Poland promises to be the first act in this development. Although neither the Pope nor those in the Warsaw regime wish the voyage to be confrontational, the truth is that the Pope's visit has placed the Polish Communists in a difficult position. Extremely serious economic problems have already caused increasing tension within the Communist leadership in Poland, and the Pope's visit cannot help but figure into the worsening political situation. For the regime to have opposed the visit could have had incalculable repercussions among Poles, a great many of whom equate their Catholicism politically with anti‐Soviet nationalism and anti‐Communism. To be sure, there are large numbers of non‐Communist Poles, especially those in the younger intelligentsia, who, though nominally Catholic, are impatient with the religious rigidity of the Polish church and the traditional right‐wing views of much of the hierarchy. Still, the Pope, socially conscious as a former worker and belonging to the church's postwar generation, has an unusually wide acceptance. And, above all things, Poland's politically militant church (the Communist Party complains that it increasingly seeks a voice in political, social and economic domains) and its new Pope from Cracow represent the most important Polish values. In this sense, the Pope's presence will loom as a unifying force for most non-Communists, and the ambivalence toward the church will recede, at least momentarily. And in a country already beset by awesome economic and social problems (this year all the “contradictions of Socialism,” as senior member of the Communist apparatus put it to me in a private conversation, seem to be converging to create a fundamental crisis), a refusal by the leadership to welcome the Polish Pope could have triggered an But beyond the borders of Poland, the effect of the visit on Catholics and Orthodox Christian believers elsewhere in Eastern Europe and even in the Soviet Union is certain to be exceedingly large. Recalling Stalin's contemptuous wartime question about “how many divisions does the Pope have?,” an Eastern European diplomat in Rome commented to me that “Brezhnev may find out that this Pope has an awful lot of divisions — politically and spiritually.” In Warsaw, Communist officials were expressing concern about the aftermath of the papal tour. The general view was that there was no way of avoiding a new surge of nationalism and anti-Communism in the region. This may be one reason for Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko's private visit to the Pope last January; Gromyko must have wanted some hint of Papal policies toward Eastern Europe. John Paul II seeks an even greater involvement in world affairs. He has the experience of having lived under both Nazi and Communist totalitarian rule. He has denounced the neutron bomb, a potential American contribution to nuclear arsenals, and he has condemned the armaments race in general. He has repeatedly denounced Marxism as an ideology, but in March the Vatican issued a Pope-approved document declaring that the outlook for success in the struggle against racism is “uncertain and ambiguous,” obviously a criticism of the West. Earlier, the Pope engaged the Vatican in direct mediation between Argentina and Chile in their war-threatening dispute over the Beagle Channel at South America's southernmost tip; no one at the Vatican can remember anything quite like this initia- Apart from his potential role as a foreign‐policy activist, and a human‐rights advocate, the Pope — judging from reactions to him in Rome, Poland and in anticlerical Mexico has emotionally touched millions of people, in a manner reminiscent of Pope John XXIII, who first moved to modernize the church with the Second Vatican Council 17 years ago. The first seven months of his pontificate have demonstrated what one of his associates described as “his determination to be totally free” in what he thinks, does and says. John Paul II seems to be a totally self‐assured man; at the same time, the new Pontiff seems to elude labels. He does not want the church or individual priests to be directly involved with political parties, a policy that earned him an early identification with conservative forces, particularly in Latin America. However, his political views are much more liberal than had been originally suspected. He has already mounted the most forceful campaign in favor of human political, economic and social in the of the modern church since Leo XIII issued his milestone Rerum Novarum encyclical in 1891. Last March, in his own encyclical, Redemptor Hominis (Redeemer of Man), setting the social and political tone for his pontificate, John Paul II came out against all forms of “totalitarianism,” “imperialism” and “neocolonialism.” He attacked economic and social exploitation of man under all political systems as well as the scourge of an over‐technological and over‐polluted world. Others think that the Pope, enormously influenced by his experiences under the Communist regime in Poland, but nevertheless disenchanted with the workings of capitalism as he has observed it during his many world trips, is searching — perhaps groping - for a new body of philosophy that would interpose itself between Marxism and capitalism. “Christian an- thropology” is the still‐vague phrase frequently employed by the Pope to convey his philosophical respect for man above all things. John Paul II, not surprisingly, wishes to strengthen the church's ecumenical dialogue with other Christians, and, early in his reign, he went out of his way to seek cooperation with Jews. The Pope's populism took root three decades ago. In 1999, as a young priest, Wojtyla (Poles pronounce the name voy-TIY-wa) expressed his admiration for the priest‐workers’ movement in France in a lengthy article — his first published piece — in Tygodnik Powszechny, the Catholic weekly in Cracow, the ancient royal capital that is his spiritual home. found this generally unknown essay in the yellowed collection of Tygodnik's back issues at the publications's walkup offices. He still stays in intimate touch with the editor of Tygodnik, Jerzy Turowicz, telephoning him and complaining that copies of the weekly are reaching him late at the Vatican. He restated his views on workerpriests 30 years later in an April 25 address to clergymen from industrial areas. He spoke passionately against unemployment and harsh working conditions, and urged that “the gap between the church and the factory be narrowed, and that the fumes of incense mix with those of industry.” In his social philosophy, John Paul II is an exponent of St. Thomas Aquinas, representing a liberal strain of church thinking, and of the teachings of Max Scheler, a Catholic philosopher of Protestant‐Jewish origin, who died in 1928. Scheler's contribution was a refinement of phenomenology, a school of ethical thought that says that Christians should relate their conduct to what they learn from their human experiences. (But the Pope accepts Scheler's methods only as a tool of ethical analysis.) Another element of his philosophical thinking is a form of existentialism that stresses the crucial importance of man and his experience. All in all, there hasn't been anyone quite like Pope John Paul II in the contemporary history of the Holy See. The sedate Vatican bureaucracy and the hidebound Roman Curia are attempting to adjust to the innovations of John Paul 11's reign, which range from his unrelenting emphasis on the terrestrial destiny of man (the Curia would have preferred a quieter and more traditional approach) to his contempt for protocol. John Paul II even refuses to display the customary papal public humility; he is the first modern Pope to say, “I,” instead of, “We.” He thinks it is “artificial” to use the plural form. Then there is the matter of his telephone habits. Until he was finally (and gently) talked out of it, the Pope used to pick up the phone himself to dial his friends around the world. One evening, telephoning his intimate friend Bishop Andre‐Marie Deskur, a fellow Pole, at a Zurich clinic, the Pope casually identified himself. He was told by the Swiss operator that “if you're the Pope, I'm the Empress of China.” Recently, a Washington, D.C., priest of Polish descent, who had met the Pope during a visit to the United States in 1976, called the papal private secretary, the Rev. Stanislaus Dziwisz, to inquire about the “bass.” John Paul II suddenly came on the line to say, “I'm fine; and how are you?” Among those the Pope still telephones on impulse are Turowicz, the Cracow editor, and engineer Jerzy Polish Jew who now lives in Rome. He was Karol Wojtyla's intimate friend when they were classmates in elementary and high school in Wadowice, the small town near Cracow where both were born. The Pope's informality is endless. During his Mexican visit, he happily donned huge sombreros, further endearing himself to the Mexicans. In Rome, the Pope broke precedent by personally marrying two commoners: a young electrician and the daughter of a street cleaner. But this, in part, stemmed from John Paul II's insistence on performing his duties as the Bishop of Rome, one of his offices, something his predecessors have generally ignored. The condition of the church at the grass‐roots level, a deteriorating one in Italy as well as in the United States, Western Europe and the third world, preoccupies the Pope greatly. He is convinced that this erosion will not be arrested if the Pontiff remains a distant and majestic figure. This is also why he devotes so much time to public audiences. In some respects, John Paul II regards his mission as being pastoral; Albino Luciani was also regarded as a “pastoral” Pope, but John Paul II, with his boundless energy, has escalated the practice of the pastorate to extraordinary heights. Thus, after Poland, other pastoral world visits are in prospect: to the United States and Canada, probably to countries in Western Europe, to Africa and Asia and, Given Poland's past of antiSemitism (as recently as March 1968, the previous Communist leadership launched a purge of Jews in official institutions although the total Jewish population now is only around 7,000), there was concern among world Jewry when Cardinal Wojtyla was elevated to the pontificate. But it was wholly unjustified; the new Pope has a long history of friendship for Jews. His childhood friend Kluger, for example, remembers that when anti‐Semitic thugs in Wadowice tried to attack Jewish students, Wojtyla came to their defense. In wartime Cracow, the future Pope made a point of taking out a Jewish girl on dates to protect her from harassment; his close friends are convinced that Wojtyla thought of himself as her escort, and that there was no romantic involvement. Her identity is a well‐kept secret to this day. As soon as his visit to Paul II resolved to celebrate mass at Auschwitz, not far from Cracow, where millions of Jews were murdered. Those who know him say the Pope's need to travel is the need to be in touch, to be informed, to see for himself; it is, they say, part of his concept of the pastoral pontificate. This extends to life at the Vatican; the Pope almost never takes a meal alone: he has guests for breakfast, lunch and dinner to talk and listen. In private audiences he sees an endless assortment of people, from kings and queens to commoners; on May 10, he granted a private audience to Rosalynn Carter (who came with her daughter, Amy), the bearer of a personal letter from the President. He has already visited most of the Vatican offices and Holy Congregations, even dropping in on the headquarters of his Swiss Guard, the impassive soldiers in medieval garb armed with halberds who stand watch at entrances to Holy See edifices. Moving around the Vatican, the Pope travels in a long black Mercedes‐Benz convertible limousine with the license plate SCV‐1 (it stands for the His literary output is still prodigious, though perforce more limited than in Cracow. The Pope usually composes his texts in his mind while walking in Vatican gardens behind the high walls. Then be returns to his study to pen his latest document (there are homilies, sermons, messages, greetings, and scores of personal letters every day). He is said never to have misquoted a citation written from memory. Impatient with detail, the Pope does not bother himself with references or footnotes: this is left to his assistants, who have to identify biblical or other pasfrom his writings. Few people in this century have written more on more diverse philosophical, theological and ethical problems than Karol Wojtyla. A partial bibliography of his works, including articles and essays, prepared recently by Dominican Fathers at Rome's Collegium ‐mgelicum (where he once studied), lists 196 items; 10 of these are books. Marriage and sensuality are recurring themes in the Pope's writings. His viewpoint concerns their relationship to Christian morality — it is again his thirst for understanding man and woman in their human entirety—and the Pope has even turned to the dramatic form to express himself. His interest in matrimony as a theme notwithstanding, there is nothing to substantiate insistent rumors that the Pope had been secretly married before taking priestly vows. Interviews with persons in Rome and Cracow who have known him since adolescence rule it out completely. Every month and year of his life was an “open book” to a multitude of friends, as one of them put it, and “there was no room for any secret marriages.” John Paul H remains, of course, a romantic and somewhat mysterious figure. His poetry, in the Polish lyrical tradition, has added to that quality. His short‐lived wartime career as an amateur actor in Cracow (he helped to organize the underground “Rhapsodic Theater” during the German occupation) has been magnified in public print since his election, but many of his childhood friends say they always thought the stage was Wojtyla's first love and they were surprised to see him turn to the priesthood. Despite John Paul I l's extroverted nature and his public style, he is described by his friends as a lonely and private person. Although he has innumerable friends, one of them said that “nobody really knows him .. . there is an Picture Credits 34‐COURTESY MARTIN-MAR IETTA CORPORATION NS‐LASKI/BLACK STAR‐SIPA PRESS 4S2‐EVELYN HOFER 66‐SYLVIA PLACHY 7S‐NASA; DU HAMEL/ SYGMA Stefan Cardinal Wyszynski, standing, discusses the Pope's visit at a Cracow clergy conference. inner barrier in him that cannot be overcome.” This could be a relic of his personal history. His mother, Emilia, died when Karol was 9. His only brother, Edmund, who was a physician, died three years later while doing experimental work involving scarlet fever at a hospital not far from their native Wadowice. It fell to his father, Karol, a retired paymaster in the Austrian and then the Polish Army, to bring up the boy. They lived in Wadowice, a drab provincial town in southern Poland. Young Karol was the brightest student in the gimnazjum, and played goalkeeper on the school soccer In the autumn of 1938 the Wojtylas moved to Cracow so that Karol could enroll at the ancient Jagiellonian University to study Polish philology. The outbreak of the war in the following year interrupted his studies, and young Wojtyla took a job at a quarry in the suburb of Zakrzowek to help his ailing father make ends meet. The father usually stayed home, cooking and, on occasion, making wooden shoes for his son. Later, Wojtyla found work at the Belgianowned Solvay Chemical Works. Wojtyla's father died in 1941, and this marked a turning point in his life. Another major influence was his friendship with a tailor named Jan Tyranowski, himself a mystic, who introduced Wojtyla to the mysteries of the Spanish Carmelite mystical The 21-year-old Wojtyla was acutely affected by the loss of his father. Except for distant cousins, he had no family. He developed a sense of loneliness despite his friendships in the theater, at the university and at work. Later he would say that the church was his “mother” (one of his first religious poems was titled “Mother') and he may have regarded the tailor‐mystic Tyranowski as surrogate father. The future Pope's wartime fellow workers at the quarry and the chemical plant remember him as ever-help- ful, a man who was always willing to take on the toughest and dirtiest jobs, a man who volunteered for night‐shift work. During rest periods, he was often found praying or reading. A friend recalls entering his room one evening at the apartment of Cracow acquaintances and stumbling over him as he lay prostrate on the floor in ecstatic prayer. Perhaps the most important moment in his life came in 1942 when he enrolled in Christian theology courses conducted by the clandestine Theology Department of Jagiellonian University (the Germans had closed down the university). He also began attending courses at the Arcebispal Spiritual Seminary directed by Cracow's Archbishop Adam Stefan Sapieha, a prince of Polish royal blood. Sapieha realized Wojtyla's promise and, in effect, became his pro- After four years of studies. the young man was personally ordained as a priest by Archbishop Sapieha on Nov. 1, 1946. The war was over, but the Communist regime was completing its takeover of Poland. and Sapieha thought the young priest should continue his studies abroad. He sent him to the Collegium Angelicum in Rome, a center of theological learning, where, within two years, the future Pope earned his doctorate in philosophy. Before returning to Poland, Wojtyla spent some time in Belgium and France, discovering the worker‐priest move- Back home, Wojtyla was assigned by Archbishop Sapieha for a year as assistant vicar to the little parish in the village of Niegowic in southern Poland. In 1949, he was brought back to Cracow as assistant vicar of St. Florian's Church, in a university parish; it was a post that left him ample time to pursue his studies. In 1951, he received his doctorate in moral theology. There was no question now that he would take the scholarly road. Wojtyla returned to the Jagiellonian University to obtain still another doctorate, this time based on a dissertation on phenomenology. In 1953, at the age of 33, Wojtyla's career as a teacher was launched. First, he lectured on social ethics at Cracow's Spiritual Seminary, In 1954, he went to Lublin, in eastern Poland, to teach philosophy at the Catholic University there. The Polish church was facing a mounting challenge from the Communist regime; Wojtyla's reputation as a church intellectual was growing so rapidly that the Polish hierarchy decided to make even better use of him. Thus, on Sept. 28, 1958, Wojtyla was consecrated as Auxiliary Bishop of Cracow. On Dec. 30, 1963, Pope Paul VI named him Archbishop of Cracow. As Archbishop, Wojtyla was invited to participate in the work of the Second Vatican Council in the mid‐1960's, playing an important role in the drafting of the crucial “Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World,” one of the milestones in the history of the contemporary church lie began to be noted by cardinals as an outstanding Catholic philosopher, and attracted the attention of Pope Paul VI. On May 29, 1967, the Pope named him Cardinal. Wojtyla was only 47, and his reputation was spreading within the church. In Poland, Cardinal Wojtyla was much more uncompromising toward the Communist regime than the aging Primate, Stefan Cardinal Wyszynski of Warsaw. Although Wyszynski was — and is — as viscerally anti‐Marxist as Wojtyla, Wyszynski believed in negotiating concessions for the Polish Church with the Communist authorities. Wojtyla, on the other hand, took the view that the Government in overwhelmingly Catholic Poland was under the obligation of vesting special rights in the church. Today, on balance, the Communists prefer to see Karol Wojtyla in Rome rather than Warsaw, since he can no longer involve himself directly in Polish politics on a day-to- One of the great misconceptions about the Pope's election to the Pontificate is that it was a stunning surprise. Hut long before Paul VI's death, the Polish Cardinal was considered a papalnle, a potential Pope, if — and it was a very big “if” — the Sacred College resolved to select a non-Italian. During the 1970's, Wojtyla was often in Rome as a member of the Permanent Commission of the Synod on Evangelization. This placed him in intimate contact with cardinals from all the world. Nevertheless, on Oct. 16, when Cardinal Villot stood in front of the Sacred College to say that Karol Jozef Cardinal Wojtyla of Cracow had been elected Pope, it was, to say the least, unexpected. Loud applause broke out inside the chapel. Soon, Pericle Cardinal Felici, the Prefect of the Supreme Tribunal of the Holy See, stepped out on the balcony and announced,” liabem us l'apam! “ to an astonished world. In 1848, Julius Slowacki, Poland's Brea! st poet, wrote these prophetic words in a poem without a title: We need strength to it ft this world of God: Thus here comes a Slavic Pope. a brother of the people - And he already pours the balms of the world on our bosoms And the angels’ chorus sweeps his throne with flowers. The prophecy came true 130 years later as Poland's Karol Wojtyla stood above St. Peter's Square to begin his Pontificate with the words, “Praised be Jesus Christ !” ■ During his visit the Pope will celebrate mass here at Auschwitz."

Robert B. Meyner. Republicans in the Assembly wanted to push through a resolution calling for an ‘ investigation of the Governor, but were unable to get a quorum to act on the measure. The reason? Democrats evaded legislative sergeants-at-arms by having themselves locked in the Governor's office. Fisticuffs among legislators have not become prevalent in Trenton, as they reportedly are in Austin, the capital of Texas. However, a couple of years ago, former State Senator Anthony Imperiale of Newark, then an Independent, offered to fight State Senator President Joseph P. Merlin, Democrat of Trenton, in the Senate men's room. Mr. Merlino was, and still is, President of the upper house. Many of the recent stories about legislative idiosyncracies have involved Mr. Imperiale, who weighs some 300 pounds. Among other things; he ‘ has been bitten by a lion and once crashed a moped into the marbled halls of the State House. He also something of a self‐taught orator and, although his frequent legislative speeches were not always relevant, they were entertaining. In addition, Mr. Imperiale is a man who rushes defend the flag and cries whenever anyone sings “Mother” in his presence. As an Assemblyman, he put his chair in the middle aisle of the chamber to dissociate himself from the 40 Republicans and 39 Democrats. As a Senator, Mr. Imperiale demanded a caucus room where he could hold a meeting of the Independents in the Legislature. The Senate leadership gave him basement closet so small that reporters had to stand in the hall whenever he held a news conference in his “caucus room.” The State House may not have seen the last of Mr. Imperiale. He has entered the primary for Assemblyman, this time on the Republican ticket. Meanwhile, the void left by Mr. Imperiale's departure after the 1977 elections has been filled somewhat by Assemblyman Kenneth A. Gewertz, Democrat of Woodbury. He sometimes wears furry boots, always drives fancy cars and seems to be perpetually in a dispute. Stripped of leadership functions this session by his fellow Democrats, Mr. Gewertz has been busy lately searching for conflicts of interests by other legislators. This move was prompted by a ruling of the Joint Ethics Committee of the Legislature that Mr. Gewertz had to divest himself of his part ownership of a company selling slot machines to Resorts International Inc. • Amid fanfare last year, Governor Byrne unveiled a Civil Service “reform” act. The measure now appears to be in deep trouble and almost assuredly will not pass this session of the Legislature, even though Mr. Byrne has given it a “priority” label. The “reform” is in trouble mainly because the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars and other organizations of ex‐servicemen oppose the section that would abolish the absolute preference given to veterans for Civil Service jobs in New Jersey. To avoid hiring veterans who barely passed Civil Service examinations, many state government departments have resorted to employing “provisionals,” people who had not taken the test. After six months on the job, a “provisional” takes the examination and, if he or she passes, gets permanent status. New Jersey Common Cause has said it finds “shocking” the fact that veterans are on top of the certification lists for 92 percent of the state jobs that pay more than $15,000 a year. The biggest protests about the absolute preference given to veterans have come from women's groups. They claim that the New Jersey law, which was passed after World War II, discriminates against women because so few Armed Forces veterans are female. The Governor may be able to rescue part of his proposal. A suggestion by experts that New Jersey create a special class of “career executives” to implement policy is included in a separate bill. Thus far, the major opposition has come from state em- Some antics and semantics in Trenton ployee unions, which have been too busy deinonstrafing for a pay raise to give the proposal their full attention. • On another front involving civil savants, Assemblymen Richard F. Visotcky of Garfield and Robert P. Hollenbeck of Carlstadt, both Democrats, have pushed through a resolution asking Governor Byrne to set up a four‐day work week for state and local governments and, wherever possible, for private enterprise. The legislators said it would save gasoline, but an aide to Mr. Byrne asserted that the Governor's staff was not enamored of the idea. “Some people already have the impression that state employees don't do as much work as they might,” the aide said. • Occasionally, circumstances combine to make public officials look foolish. This happened to Governor Byrne the other day when, shortly after urg- ing New Jerseyans to drive less and save gasoline, he took a state heliocopter to Washington and sent his Lincoln limousine — rented at a cut rate from the Ford Motor Company — to the capital to pick him up at the airport and drive him downtown. All this prompted a spate of editorial comment the state, with the most popular theme being that Mr. Byrne's message was: “Do as I say and not as do.” To top off a not‐altogether satisfactory week, least from a public relations standpoint, the Governor hied off to Florida for five days to give a speech to a convention of savings and loan executives. • .

Until last Friday, those insurance companies that guarantee real‐estate titles to be clear of encumberances had been allowed to charge what the traffic would bear. The basic charge that the 19 title companies operating in New Jersey may assess is $3.65 for each $1,000 of the first $50,000 of the sales price, then $2.50 per $1,000 from $50,000 to $100,000, $2 per $1,000 from $100,000 to $500,000, $1.50 per $1,000 from $500,000 to $2 million and $1.25 per $1,000 over $2 million. In addition,the title companies will be allowed charge up to $150 fora title search. • The state's Marine Police are still searching, when they have the time, for a big rock that may (or may not) have fallen from the sky into Barnegat Bay last month. Several witnesses reported having seen ‐a glowing object as big as a small truck drop into the bay on the evening of April 18. It was making a hissing noise. Experts don't believe it was a meteorite because one that size would have wreaked havoc for several miles. Several days after the alleged “fall,” clam diggers snagged on to a big rock just where the “hissing” object was seen entering the water. A Marine Police diver went down to look at it, and reported was at least eight feet long. The Coast Guard was going to pull up the rock see what it might be, but buoys marking its location were 'swept away in a storm. Since then, divers have been unable to find the rock again. Debate on a revision of New Jersey's abortion laws has been postponed until at least June 14, prompting two officials of the New Jersey Right Life Committee to accuse the Democratic leadership in the Assembly of “selling out” anti‐abortion forces. The Assembly Speaker, Christopher J. York, Democrat of West New York, has agreed to hold the bill in abeyance until June 14. “Some of the boys said they didn't want it to come up right now,” he said. The Democratic and Republican primaries are on June 5. Joan McLaughlin, legislative director of the Right to Life Committee, termed the “moral cowardice” displayed by the postponement “a disgrace.” “The Democratic process is being shortcircuited by politicians more interested in the next election that in the next generation,” Mrs. Mc- Laughlin declared. The proposed revision would require doctors notify the parents of girls under 18 if they sought an abortion. It also would require women over that age to acknowledge they had been notified that it was the state's official position that a fetus, no matter what its age, was a living human and to mull over having an abortion for 48 hours. Meanwhile, a three‐judge Appellate Divison the State Superior Court has upheld a regulation of the state's Board of Medical Examiners that abortions after the 12th week of pregnancy must be performed in a hospital. Dr. Robert Livingston, director of Metropolitan Medical Associations, an abortion clinic in Englewood Cliffs, had appealed the regulation. The judges said they recognized that having abortions in hospitals might prove to be beyond the financial means of some women, but upheld the Board of Medical Examiners’ judgement that abortions after the 12th week would be safer in hospitals because of possible complications. • The New York Times/Minato E.

"The Name's Miss McTeer: Wife, Lawyer And, at 27, Canada's New First Lady",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/27/archives/the-names-miss-mcteer-wife-lawyer-and-at-27-canadas-new-first-lady.html,"TORONTO, May 26 — Move over Margaret. Here comes Maureen. In recent years Canada's First Lady, Margaret Trudeau, has gained worldwide attention for her exploits, estrangement and exit as the wife of Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau. Now, Mr. Trudeau himself is on the way out of the Prime Minister's residence, the victim after 11 years in office of electioni Tuesday that brought in a Progressive Conservative Government. • On June 4, Joe Clark, a 39-year-old Westerner, will take over as Prime Minister, the youngest of the 16 who have held the post. And the new First Lady will be his wife, Maureen McTeer, a lawyer who has already shaken up the prim ways and stern demeanor of Canada's Conservatives. They may not have fully realized what else they were getting when they elected Mr. Clark party leader in 1976, but these Conservatives, the rest of Canada and the rest of the world are about to find out. Steely with the press, charming with the voters and tough on aides, Miss McTeer has just completed eight weeks on the campaign trail. Closeted in an Alberta mountain lodge this weekend, she is helping her husband and other party officials plan the changeover of governments, select a new Cabinet and draft party policies. Then there is the impending move into the Prime. Minister's residence, an imposing mansion at 24 Sussex Drive in Ottawa. And her sixth wedding anniversary next month. And, of course, her work at the law firm. And final studies for the bar exam this fall. And her crusade for improved legislation on rape. And her 2-year-old daughter, Catherine. Miss McTeer is 27 years old. . As Miss McTeer might put it, if she was granting any interviews these days, “So?” The precocious offspring of a political patriarch, the eldest of five girls and one boy, Miss McTeer has been in politics for more than half her life. She seems so decisive, so effective and so genuine when glad‐handing that someone suggested the Conservatives would have gotten a majority in Parliament had she been the candidate, instead of the minority won by her husband, whose image is not so decisive, not so effective and not so genuine. Overshadowed by Trudeaus Until now, the couple has been overshadowed by the Trudeaus — the dashing if aging Prime Minister, and his estranged wife who is photographed walking off television shows or dancing in discos. In contrast, the Clarks are seen dancing together — close. They like French restaurants and breakfasts together in the garden. For a wild party once, they served strawberries and champagne. (That wasn't the time they took their dinner guests Christmas caroling.) The political and social whirl is nothing new to Miss McTeer, who grew up near Ottawa in Cumberland, Ontario. It was small, like her husband's hometown of High River, Alberta, but not beneath politics. Her father, John, was a grass‐roots Conservative Ontario politician. From the age of 12 she was exposed to the world of politics. She went to many meetings “so I could stay up after 9.” She was precocious — and serious. When her father lost a municipal race, she was the only one who cried. At 15 Miss McTeer knew the provincial premier; at 16 she was president of the local Young Progressive Conservatives. “We were taught as we were growing up,” she said, “that we had a responsibility to be involved in the political process and that you lost your right to complain if you didn't vote and didn't participate. I took it seriously. It's something that gets into your blood.” Politics as a Career Through grade eight Miss McTeer attended a one‐room bilingual school at Beckett's Creek. There, she picked up the fluent French that is now a necessity in Canadian national politics. It also enabled her to go sightseeing and sunning in France the other summer while her husband studied French — a sure sign Mr. Clark was making a serious bid for the Prime Minister's job. Mr. McTeer remembers talking with his daughter about her career. He mentioned law and politics. And after discarding medicine because of the chemistry courses and nursing because of all the blood, she agreed. Politics won, and she dreamed of running for office and defeating prominent Liberals. She also concedes she wanted to know if politicians “were really such a bunch of old fogies or whether they would let women in.,, After winning two debating scholarships, she got a bachelor of arts degree at the University of Ottawa. Always, like her husband-to-be 2,000 miles to the west, she was deeply involved in political organizations and campaigning. Later, to finance hey classes, she held down a full‐time research job for the Conservatives while attending law school, also full‐time. In 1972 the party office let her go; perhaps it was her devotion to a collection of causes, or her firm though not strident enthusiasm for the women's movement. Soon after, a friend mentioned a job opening in Mr. Clark's office. She got it. Later came dinner invitations, more dates and the ultimate tip‐off: 21 roses on her birthday. They were married in June 1973. Her decision to • keep her maiden name came up over tea in many bedrock Conservative homes across Canada. (The reason is simple: she wants her parents to see the name McTeer on a law firm door someday.) Her decision is still commented upon and in some places she is nonetheless intro- duced as Mrs. Clark. She professes surprise even at this tiny uproar. “There are so many more important things to worry about,” she says. A Woman of Opinions Some of those other outspoken worries have gotten her into hot water too at times. Such as her views on premarital sex: “Good heavens, anyone who thinks teen‐agers aren't having sexual intercourse must be blind.” Or her views on abortion (clinics should be available to those who want it) in a country 40 percent Roman Catholic, including the McTeers and the Clarks. Then there was the time at the Parliamentary Wives Association meeting when she moved that wives who sacrifice their own careers for their husbands’ political jobs should receive compensation. At one point, after Miss McTeer helped get her husband elected party leader, her mother suggested she might tone it down a bit. “Sure,” said the daughter, “I could hide in a cup. board for the next 10 years.” But she hasn't. Instead, she did a radical thing: She announced that she had her own opinions and they were not necessarily the same as her husband's. In between public appearances and campaigning Miss McTeer has been su- pervising the running of her nine-bedroom home, called Stornoway, the official residence of the opposition leader. She prefers to do the food shopping herself, and watches over her husband's eating habits so carefully that she makes him take a mug of eggnog in the car on mornings when he skips breakfast. In recent campaign days Miss McTeer has been away more than she likes from her daughter, Catherine, whose allergy attacks are a matter of concern. But at home the two go for walks or play or talk while Miss McTeer cooks, another favorite pastime. She is famous for her fruit pies. She is also famous for her clear blue eyes, which rivet listeners during conversations. And for a temper, which, perhaps prodded by migraine headaches, can bring an expletive or two to her lips and those around her to their feet. Mr. Clark pays close attention to her and to her opinions. The decision, for instance, to seek the Conservative leadership was made jointly. And it appears unlikely that this would change now just because Mr. Clark is becoming the leader of the second largest country in the world. “I'm not the type,” Miss McTeer has noted, “to fade into the woodwork.” Associated Press Maureen McTeer and her husband, Joe Clark, Canada's Prime Minister‐elect."
"Dispute Over the Risks of 2,4,5‐T Continues Despite a Federal Ban",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/27/archives/dispute-over-the-risks-of-245t-continues-despite-a-federal-ban-use.html,"The fight over whether 2,4,5‐T is safe to use is almost certain to continue into the foreseeable future. Douglas M. Costle, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, signed an emergency order Feb. 28 suspending the use of products containing 2,4,5‐T in forests, along rights of way, in pastures, around homes and in aquatic and recreation areas. The agency explained that it was taking the action because dioxin‐laden 2,4,5T had been linked to miscarriages in the Alsea basin area of Oregon, where the herbicide was used regularly on timberland. In a Washington news conference March 1, Barbara Blum, deputy administrator of the the E.P.A., said: “The warning signals from the Alsea study, the preponderance of strong animal test data and the low short‐term economic impact compel this unusual emergency action.” Use on Rangeland Continues The agency did not ban the use of products containing 2,4,5‐T in rangelands where cattle graze, although some studies have found dioxin in the flesh of beef cattle in the Middle West, or in ricelands. It was not entirely clear why these two major uses were exempted, but a spokesman for the agency said subsequently that the Government would consider widening the ban to include them. The Dow Chemical Company, which makes 50 to 60 percent of the nation's supply of 2,4,5‐T, filed a motion March 7 in Federal district court in Bay City, Mich., seeking a stay of the E.P.A.'s emergency order on the ground that the agency did not have valid reasons for acting. On April 12, Judge James Harvey rulet against Dow, holding that “the court is unable to say that E.P.A. made a clear error of judgment” in asserting that the products in question were associated with spontaneous abortion in humans. “There is evidence in the record,” he said, “that the animal studies and the Alsea II study, although certainly inconclusive, are nevertheless suggestive of the conclusions reached by E.P.A. in this regard.” Reluctance on Decision But he concluded: “The court will frankly concede that it arrives at this decision with great reluctance and would not in its judgment have ordered the emergency suspensions on the basis of the information before the E.P.A. Nevertheless, E.P.A has been vested by Congress with broad powers in this area, and the court is not empowered to substitute its judgment for that of E.P.A.” On April 23, Dow announced its withdrawal from suspension hearings that had been called by the agency. A spokesman for Dow said that the concern wanted to devote all of its energies to cancellation hearings, not yet scheduled, in which the agency would essentially attempt to make its emergency order permanent. In the weeks since the ban, products containing 2,4,5‐T have begun to disappear from the shelves of farm and garden supply stores around the nation. In New York State, the Department of Environmental Conservation announced that if its inspectors found such products in stores, they would be removed and placed under quarantine until the E.P.A. developed a system for their disposal./"
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/30/archives/letters-oilimporter-power.html,"To the Editor: Is there any reason why the United States, Western Europe and Japan can't band together to form a consortium of oil‐buying nations? What better way to beat the oil cartel than by forming one massive oil‐buying bloc? True, national frictions between Western nations have often made it difficult to present a united front. But the Arabs overcame their traditional differences to form OPEC, and we smoothed over numerous disputes to form NATO. Why shouldn't we do it again? OPEC represents a direct threat to all oil‐importing nations, as harmful as any military adventure. Every oil‐importing nation is dangerously vulnerable if the OPEC cartel stands unopposed. It would be well for us to face this realistically and set aside a large amount of capital designated as money lost because of rising oil prices. But rather than lose those funds to the OPEC nations, we should spend the money to mine coal and prepare a massive energy stockpile for future bargaining against OPEC. The U.S. has enormous coal deposits, which could be used for just such a purpose. It would be difficult for OPEC to raise prices if faced by a united OPIC (Organization of Petroleum Importing Countries) buttressed by large energy reserves. Capricious pricing would even be foolhardy. We should remember that the OPEC nations are essentially one‐product producers. If they suffer the sudden low of the entire oil market, however briefly, they lose their entire revenue. Very few governments can endure such a calamity more than a few weeks. Construction Workers In Fear of Competition To the Editor: Your recent editorial “Mr. Carter in Concrete,” calling for repeal of the Davis‐Bacon Act was on the mark: It is unfair, and inflationary, that a minority of workers — unionized construction workers — can determine wages paid to the majority of workers on Federal construction projects. In his May 17 letter to The Times, Secretary of Labor Ray Marshall appears to be blinded by loyalty in his support for continuance of the DavisBacon Act. If he insists on championing organized labor, he should try selfhelp methods that would make organized labor more competitive with workers in merit (open) shops. Union construction workers are “uniquely vulnerable” because they have priced themselves out of the market. By the way, construction workers employed by merit‐shop contractors are working approximately 1,800 hours per year, 600 hours more than Mr. Marshall contends. I agree with what Senator Jake Garn of Utah said in recent testimony on the Davis‐Bacon Act: Marshall should try harder at being Secretary of Labor and less at being Secretary of Labor (unions). Hands for a Terrorist To the Editor: Has anyone questioned why William Morales was in the hospital being fitted with artificial bands? [News story May 22.] It must cost a great deal of money. Who is paying for it? We can only assume that someone who is working fora public agency decided to spend our (taxpayers') money on Morales's medical care. I haven't read any news account of public money compensating the F.A.L.N.'s victims or their survivors. If God decided that this vicious killer of innocent people should lose his hands, which bureaucrat had the authority to interfere? Rent‐Cutting Device To the Editor: Representative Weiss (letter May 21) refers to the “the fact that without [rent] controls huge profits could be made from New York City's housing shortage.” If such huge profits were a possibility, huge investment in buildings would follow. This would supply enough housing to provide reasonable rentals for all because of the competition provided by a free market. Core Curriculum Controversy (Continued) To the Editor: It is true enough, as Edward T. Wilcox of Harvard was quoted as saying in Michael Knight's article of May 16, that the new Harvard “core curriculum” is “not like ‘Western Civilization’ at Columbia University, which is taught, by God, no matter what.” But allow me to offer a refinement of the letter, if not the spirit, of his statement. There is no course called “Western Civilization” at Columbia. What we do have, and have had for 40 years, is a set of five courses on different aspects of civilization in the West (literature and philosophy, politics and society, art, music and the English language), and we require Columbia College students to complete all five, as well as additional requirements in the natural sciences and foreign languages, for the B.A. degree. The five courses are taught in small sections rather than large lectures, and the instructors meet regularly to plan, coordinate and evaluate the content of the courses. The faculty of Columbia College makes bold to call these arrangements a “core curriculum.” The faculty of Harvard College, bolder still, presents a list of 55 (soon to be 80 or 100) specialized courses as a “core curriculum.” It seems to me that this curriculum is fatter than a core. But Harvard has decided: core it is, and core it shall be called, by God, no matter what. Message From A Dinosaur To the Editor: I have just read that I have “virtually disappeared.” Eleanor Holmes Norton, who heads the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (and therefore someone who ought to know) had announced in “rousing keynote address” at the Women in Crisis Conference that “woman has been converted from housewife to worker. The housewife has virtually disappeared.” “That's me,” I thought. “I'm the vanishing housewife who doesn't work.” Then I thought, perhaps before I disappear altogether, it might be of some interest to New York Times readers and other students of exotic lore if I recorded what it's like to be a living human anachronism. Here goes. I am 45 years old, married, with three male children and a dog. I live in an elderly three‐bedroom house in the suburbs. Periodically I attend a house of worship and Board of Education meetings. I've used the same dentist and pediatrician for the last 10 years. I participate in village cleanups. This year I was Cub Scout Pack One's committee secretary (my husband's the packmaster). I have been known to do volunteer work for my village school, my congregation, my community and whatever else I feel warrants my help. My worry time is between four and six in the morning and generally centers on my children and husband. My private time is after everyone is in bed, including me. I do mostly “scratch” cooking but no ironing. Although I'm not Catholic, I tend to view abortion as killing babies. I believe men and women are different mentally and emotionally, as well as physically, and that these differences are complementary and essential to our survival as a species. I've got no objection to being considered part of the problem rather than the solution, whatever that means. I'd like to write more, especially about my relationships with my mother (close) and my sister (also close), but Billy's home from school and wants his snack, and the dog has to be picked up from the vet. I'll just add that I prefer to wear my skirts at the modish hemline, same as everyone else, but I haven't had time this year for a mid‐life crisis. Maybe in July when Billy goes to camp. Half‐Gallon Gimmick To the Editor: The sale of half gallons of gasoline is another rip‐off foisted on the public by Governor Carey. On a recent TV interview, a spokesman for a group of protesting service station operators stated that they would be happy if they could add to their selling price the 3 or 4 cents a gallon increase they are paying the oil companies. I believe that as an alternative a service charge of 50 cents to $1 per purchase on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays would serve a twofold purpose. First, it would reduce the lines at gas stations by those who purchase only a few gallons to keep their tanks full. People would be encouraged to wait until they needed half a tank or more to fill up. Second, the service charge would compensate gas station operators for staying open weekends and holidays to accommodate motorists. Motorists would be happy to pay a smaller service charge on weekday purchases as long as they know it is a set fee, regardless of the amount of the purchase. Morocco's Proper Presence in the Western Sahara To the Editor: The May 11 Op‐Ed article entitled “Morocco's Saharan Venture,” by Eqbal Ahmad, requires a response to present a more balanced picture. Mr. Alunad indicates that Morocco's policy is expansionist and dangerously adventurous. It is, in fact, quite the opposite. Throughout Morocco's history, its fate has been connected closely with the Western Sahara. As recently as the beginning of the 20th century the Western Sahara was part of the Moroccan territory. As a matter of fact, the reigning Alaoui dynasty of King Hassan II comes from the Tafilat oasis in the Sahara. The advisory opinion of the World Court in 1974 recognized that Saharan tribes throughout the region manifested allegiance to the Moroccan sultans. France and Spain carved up the territory between them, but Morocco's claims to the Western Sahara remained alive in the hearts of its people and were publicly proclaimed time and again. When Spain finally renounced colonialism, it relinquished control over the Western Sahara. I have to recall here the “Green March” of November 1975, when 350,000 Moroccans, armed only with banners and the Koran, peacefully crossed the border into the Western Sahara to demonstrate the determination of our people to keep its ancient land. It was after the Green March that the United Nations Security Council recommended that all parties (Spain, Mauritania and Morocco) start peaceful negotiations. Thereafter the Tripartite Agreement of Madrid of Nov. 14, 1975, transferred the region to Morocco and Mauritania, and the United Nations recognized the transfer in a resolution which the United States supported (3458B). Therefore, whatever one's precise legal concept, Mere can be no doubt that Spain ceded the territory in a laudable act of decolonization and that Morocco and Mauritania administer the region as a matter of internationally recognized right — an essential part of which Is the right of self‐defense and the responsibility to maintain internal order. The Saharan population is largely nomadic and predominantly illiterate. Nevertheless, when in 1978 Morocco held free and national elections in which all political parties (from Communists to Conservatives) participated and elected parliamentary deputies, the Sahara provinces participated fully; today their representatives sit in the national Parliament in Rabat as well as in all the appropriate local and regional bodies. Saharan freedom of choice is as great as that enjoyed by the people of Massachusetts or Minnesota. One might add that no competing political parties, no free press, no multiparty elections are per mitted in Algeria. Mr. Ahmad astonishingly describes Algeria as “democratic” while also speaking of Algeria's “single party”. Algeria has never registered a formal claim to the Western Sahara. Yet in 1973 Algeria created the so‐called Polisario Front, many of whose leaders are not Saharans, and it has, together with Libya, equipped it lavishly with weapons of Soviet manufacture. It is this “Polisario” opposition which seeks “self‐determination” through repeated attacks on the Moroccan and Mauritanian forces that are present in the Western Sahara under a freely contracted international treaty recognized by the United States and the United Nations. The presence of Morocco's administrative and military personnel in the region is as legitimate as its right to self‐defense is unquestionable."
H.E.W. to Study Accident Effects In A‐Plant Area,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/30/archives/hew-to-study-accident-effects-in-aplant-area-pennsylvania-will-join.html,"WASHINGTON, May 29 — The Department of Health, Education and Welfare and the State of Pennsylvania will undertake extensive studies of the health effects of the accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant, Secretary Joseph A. Califano Jr. and Pennsylvania officials confirmed today. The studies, unprecedented in the United States, will include a census of roughly 17,000 households involving 50,000 residents living within five miles of the plant and an effort to find, through relatives and neighbors, people who might have left Pennsylvania since the accident March 28. They will also include an $80,000 study of pregnant women living within a 10mile radius of the nuclear plant. The health of the women will be checked all through pregnancy until the birth of their children within the next year, and the children will be monitored in their first several months of life. ‘No Reason for Alarm’ “It's just common sense to do this,” Mr. Califano said today. “There's no reason for alarm. There is no reason for concern. I said some time ago we would study the population and we would particularly focus on pregnant women.” Gov. Dick ‘Thornburgh recommended the evacuation of pregnant women and children from a five‐mile radius of the site on March 30 to reduce the chances, if any, that radiation might cause some women to bear babies with birth defects or that some children might develop cancer or other medical problems later on. The decision was based on the fact that the developing embryo, the fetus and growing children are the most vulnerable to the hazards of radiation. No Rush for Abortions The women and children were told on April 9 that it was safe to return and the medical authorities in Pennsylania appeared to have allayed the fears of pregnant women to the extent that there was no immediate rush for abortions. A third study still in the formative stages will be “an assessment of some fair, representative group of people subjected to the strain of the accident,” Mr. Califano said. This is to be undertaken through the National Institute of Mental to be undertaken with ?? ?? of the Nuclear Regula?? will examine the health ?? ?? the nuclear plant. ?? ??ich is being financed ?? ??er for Disease Control ?? ??

Joyce Freeman, executive director of the Pennsylvania Commission on Three Mile Island, said that state officials hoped that the study could be continued for as long as 20 years."
BUSINESS PEOPLE,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/31/archives/business-people-bankamerica-picks-a-worldunit-chief-coping-with-a.html,"In a major management change at the BankAmerica Corporation — parent of the Bank of America, the nation's largest, with assets of $94.9 billion —the responsibility for the world banking division was transferred yesterday from C.J. Medberry, chairman, to Leland S. Prussia, one of the San Francisco‐based company's three vice chairmen. Mr. Medberry, 61 years old, had overseen the division from 1974 to January 1977, when it was transferred to Alvin C. Rice, another vice chairman. Mr. Rice resigned in August 1978 after a confrontation over personal real‐estate transactions (he was cleared by a grand jury last March of any violatioa of Federal law), and Mr. Medberry again took over at worldbanking. Some sources in California termed this assignment a stopgap until a realignment could be put into effect. Under the reorganization, Mr. Medberry will be responsible for strategic planning and will lead the bank's efforts to prepare for some of the changes expected in the industry during the next decade, the company said. A.W. Clausen, president and chief executive officer, said that Mr. Medberry would be responsible for developing the Bank of America's position on such matters as interstate banking, modifications in the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation Q (which governs interest rates) and the blurring of various financial and nonfinancial institutions' roles. “The changes that are imminent over the horizon are going to make the changes of the last decade seem pale by comparison,” he asserted. Earnings of the world banking division, encompassing national and international wholesale banking services, “remained flat” in 1978, according to BankAmerica's annual report. The company reported that overall income before securities transactions for the year rose 30 percent, to $514.2 million. Mr. Medberry, whose full name is Chauncey J. Medberry 3d, began his career with the bank as a teller in a Beverly Hills branch. He has held a variety of posts at BankAmerica and its subsidiary and was named chairman in 1971. Mr. Prussia, 50, had been treasurer of the corporation and cashier of the bank, assignments that have now been given to Samuel H. Armacost, a 40year‐old executive vice president. A veteran of 23 years at the bank, Mr. Prussia was appointed vice chairman in 1978. Coping With A Wage‐Price Accusation As president of the first company to be identified by the Council on Wage and Price Stability as out of compliance with the President's price guidelines, John A. Love of Ideal Basic Industries is naturally concerned with the implications of the announcement. His public reaction to the charge, made earlier this month, that an Ideal division had raised prices by more than it was entitled to was expressed cautiously and without rancor. “We feel that we are in compliance,” he said yesterday in a telephone interview from his Denver headquarters, soon after returning from a trip to China. “We have filed the appropriate documents seeking a reversal of that finding and have not had a response yet.” As he continued talking, however, the 62‐year‐old lawyer and former Republican Governor of Colorado became a bit more outspoken. “There aren't the normal procedural and regulatory provisions that apply in the wage and Price thing,” said Mr. Love. “The rules are what they say they are on any given day. In some ways, it's like punching a pillow.” A fight is nothing new to Mr. Love. As a practicing lawyer in Colorado Springs, he came from political obscurity to win the Colorado gubernatorial election in 1962. Then, in 1967, he signed what was at the time the most permissive abortion law in the nation's history, bringing cries from opponents that the state would become an “abortion mill” for the rest of the country. After serving two and a half terms as Governor, he resigned to go to Washington in 1973 as the first energy czar, becoming an assistant to President Nixon. Some six months later, he resigned, disillusioned after a reorganization proposal left him what he considered a superfluous job. He joined Ideal in 1974 as senior vice president and in two steps over the next year became president and chief executive officer. Does he consider the naming of Ideal as a price‐guideline violator a political action by a Democratic Administration against a prominent Republican? “I doubt it,” Mr. Love said. “The pressure was Just on to identify somebody. think we should prevail.”"
A‐TESTS CITED ANEW IN DEATHS OF SHEEP,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/03/archives/atests-cited-anew-in-deaths-of-sheep-utah-ranchers-are-going-back.html,"WASHINGTON, June 1 — The sheep started dying in 1953, and to the ranchers around the Government's Atomic Test Site in Nevada, the cause seemed obvious radiation. But in 1956, the courts did not agree and the case was dismissed. Now, armed with newly released Government documents, some of which show that the 9,200 dead sheep had absorbed up to 1,000 times the maximum amount of radioactive iodine considered safe for humans, the ranchers are going back to court to seek reparations. “The Government's coverup and the Goveniment's ability to control expert witnesses prohibited us from establishing that radioactivity was the cause of the deaths,” explained Dan S. Bushnell, the sheepmen's attorney. “The recent release of information confirms our belief there was a coverup and that a fraud was perpetrated on the court.” The case may have significant implications for another imminent court case, one involving the human residents of the ranches and quiet hamlets of Nevada, Utah and Arizona. ‘A Very Heavy Moral Burden’ There are a number of important distinctions between the two cases, including the level of exposure and the time of the onset of illness. However, Stewart L. Udall, the former Interior Secretary and the attorney handling a class action lawsuit against the Government on behalf of residents, believes that should the sheep ranchers prove a causal link between radiation fallout and sheep death, his case will also be a success. The suit involves more than half a billion dollars in damages for some 600 claims representing 275 individual disorders. Of the ranchers’ case, Mr. Udall said: “This is the only case in the fallout area which has been litigated and then the Government won. If it is proven there was a miscarriage of justice and the Government suppressed evidence, it seems to me this puts a very heavy moral burden on the Government to do something for the human beings.” There had been 20 atomic weapons tests when, in March 1953, possible radiation symptoms began appearing among sheep in and around Cedar City, Utah. There were spontaneous abortions, lambs were stunted at birth and many sheep had lesions consistent with radiation burns found in cattle tested in earlier atomic blasts. The first deaths started in late April, and by late May angry and concerned ranchers began complaining. The first suit was filed in 1955 by David C. McRae and Kern Bulloch, both from longtime ranching families from Cedar City. They charged that fallout from a 24‐kiloton blast code‐named “Nancy” had resulted in the contamination and deaths of 1,500 of their sheep. Government Cited Natural Causes Six other ranchers quickly followed, all filing suits in Federal District Court. But the cases ended when Judge A. Sherman Christensen ruled in the initial suit that the ranchers had not been able to establish the connection between the nuclear fallout and the deaths of the animals wintering near the Nevada proving grounds. At the trial, Government scientists contended that the sheep died from natural causes, including malnutrition, lack of water and eating poisonous grasses. Privately, some Government scientists were.admitting that radiation could have been a contributing factor in the deaths of the sheep. But publicly, the ranchers were ridiculed by bomb‐testing officers when they complained of fallout, according to testimony heard last April in Salt Lake City at a subcommittee hearing chaired by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts. Some of those original ranchers have since died, but their children are continuing the fight. Together, the ranchers, in seven separate cases, are asking for about $222,000 in damages. Mr. Bushnell, who was also the attorney in the original case, will refile the suit against the Government in two to three months, he said. The animals had been wintering about 50 miles northeast of the Nevada test site when the Atomic Energy Commission, which was then in charge of the testing program, began its series of detonations in the spring of 1953 called “Upshot‐Knothole.” One of these explosions resulted in fallout heavy enough to warrant a Public Health Service warning to civilians, who were farther away from the test area then the sheep, to stay indoors. Ranchers Complained of Own Ills When reports of sick and dying sheep began coming in, Government scientists started checking nearby areas for similar problems. They found sheep ranchers who complained that they had personally been affected, suffering minor facial burns and two‐day‐long headaches. Some of the documents concerning the testing were released following Freedom of Information Act requests. Others were found in Utah state archives or had been requested by Gov. Scott M. Matheson of Utah and released by him earlier this year. They show the following: One Navy radiological expert studying the animals wrote to the Atomic Energy Commission's office in Albuquerque, N.M., that “radiation was at least contributing factor in the loss of these animals.” A June 10, 1953, preliminary report by Dr. Arthur H. Wolff, acting chief of the radiological health training sector of the Department of Health Education and Welfare, noted: “Of greater significance, however, is that such surprisingly high concentrations of radioactive elements have become fixed in or on the aforementioned tissues in an area so far removed from the Nevada proving ground.” At a meeting that October, one Atomic Energy Commission official, Dr. Gordon Dunning, said that the animal deaths might cause problems in “purse strings” being open, threatening the life of further tests. That meeting ended with a statement being prepared for the energy commissioners that fallout was not related to sheep problems. The released Government reports had been classified “restricted.”"
LETTERS TO THE LONG ISLAND EDITOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/03/archives/long-island-opinion-letters-to-the-long-island-editor-a-voice-in.html,"This is in response to the article “A Shelter for Dogs Stirs Ire” [May 20]. I must take exception to the fact that William Glaser, president of the Huntington Hills Civic Association, of which I am a member, states that “our” association is against this shelter on Pinelawn Road. I was never polled on this issue, nor notified of any vote taking place. I am not against this shelter, but am totally for it. How can there be a conflict between the dog pounds that murder animals whose only crime is not being wanted, and a group that tries to find homes for these defenseless “best friends” of ours? It is inconceivable to me that we can be so heartless while pretending to be humane for the most hypocritical reasons. How can a dog shelter several miles removed affect our “residential” neighborhood? Marlene Bettman Melville ‘Blatant Inequity’ In Property Taxes The recent article “Revaluation's Impact on the Homeowner” will undoubtedly be among the first of many issue‐raisers during the upcoming mandated 100 percent assessment on property in New York State. Perhaps the most disturbing aspect is the notion that an individual's real property should be taxed to support local government spending for services. It ignores the blatant inequity of asking elderly, single, childless and smaller property‐owning households to bear equally in the support of services that they use not at all or to a lesser extent than their larger‐household neighbors, while other households pay next to nothing at all. After all, why should anyone pay for something one doesn't use or pay the same for less use of services? The cost to a citizen should be proportionate to his use of them. For example, owners of similar properties pay the same school taxes whether they have had or have many children in school or will never have had any at all. This has allowed large sums of money to become available to well‐meaning school boards, resulting in astronomical budgets that would have been inconceivable if only those using the schools were taxed. This reveals the basic flaw in the tax system. The “equal” taxing of everyone gives the illusion of affordability of services. Put simply, it becomes too easy to spend other people's money. People who don't own property at all, typically those who rent their homes, pay no property or school tax. Singlefamily home renters are in fact paying the taxes that the landlord incurs on his property, but never are the taxes on multiple‐family dwellings as many times more those the average singlefamity homeowner pays as there are households occupying these multiple dwettings and apartments. These households use all the municipally provided services and perhaps to even a greater extent, considering their dependence on public recreational facilites. Shouldn't these households be qually responsible to for services through higher taxes charged to and collected by their landlords? As the article points out, revenues from residential property taxes stand to increase upon devaluation of certain commercial properties. This will impact areas differently as commercial owners pay less tax and residential property owners pick up the slack. Increasing the tax rate could accomplish the same thing after the devaluation, but the revaluation of residential properties should help to more equitably distribute the new burden. If one can accept at all the premise of taxes on property paying for public services, the 100 percent assessment is desirable, but far less consequential than the extent to which devaluation of commercial property will impact the real property tax base, which determines the tax rate necessary to raise the money (taxes) to pay for services. The new burden on the homeowners will be spread more evenly once the considerable differences in assessments are adjusted. The article also makes one wonder whether residential property owners, as well as commercial ones, aren't entitled to rebates for disproportionately high assessments and taxes paid over the years as compared with some of their neighbors on underassessed properties. Maybe those same neighbors should be expected to pay back taxes. The time is long overdue that a truly fair method of paying for the things we use be implemented. William P. Murray Wantagh ‘Ludicrous Logic’ Seen In Abortion‐Fund Vote The purpose of this letter is to take strong issue with Assemblyman Angelo Orazio's remarks appearing in Frank Lynn's recent column on Medicaid funds for abortions. Mr. Lynn indicates that Mr. Orazio voted in favor of the measure. What disturbs me most is Mr. Orazio's ludicrous logic. First, Mr. Orazio (my Assemblyman) indicates that he is a Roman Catholic and personally opposes abortion, but believes it should not be subject to legislation. Why then didn't he abstain, not vote, or vote against the measure? Further, Mr. Orazio says that his district is 50 percent Catholic, but that the Jewish vote would comprise a larger portion of the Democratic balloting in Primary. This may be correct, but the chances of Mr. Orazio's having a primary contender are nonexistent, as evidenced by the fact that in his last three Assembly races, there has not been even a murmur of the possibility of a primary contender for Mr. Orazio. Moreover, in 1971 he was a candidate for Town Supervisor and in 1973 he ran for County Clerk, both times without opposition from within the party. Finally, Mr. Orazio concludes by saying that he would lose his Democratic constituency if he voted against the abortion measure. Unfortunately, he fails to realize that he has a larger constituency composed of Republicans, Conservatives, Liberals and Right‐to Life people. Thomas F. Liotti Carle Place The writer was Democratic candidate for Supervisor of the Town of North Hempstead in 1977."
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/03/archives/letters-profit-hurdle-in-the-path-to-an-energy-solution.html,"To the Editor: I am amazed at the proliferation of articles extolling the merits of gasohol, a reflection of our nation's symptomatic approach to this artificially induced energy crisis — artificial because it presupposes an indefinite tie to the petroleum industry. After all, gasohol is still 90 percent gasoline and will not relieve significantly our national dependence on petroleum. At what point will the combined corporate interests of the automotive and petroleum industries coincide with the consumer's needs? I suspect that our energy crisis is really a priority crisis. Whenever the potential short‐range profits of an alternative energy source exceed the risks of innovation, I am confident that corporate technology will eliminate the energy crisis. During the interim, however, methanol is a superior alternative to gasoline or gasohol. Methanol has four primary advantages: a literally endless supply, since it can be produced from so many natural sources (wood, grain, garbage, etc.); a cost‐efficient production capability, when one contrasts it with the potential costs and unreliable sources of gasoline; adaptability to present automobiles, with minor modifications, and clean combustion, leaving no carbon monoxide or other pollutants. This information has been around for many years, but where are the methanol advocates? Of course, another more fundamental question might be posed: Why is it that in 75 years there has not been marketed a single innovative alternative to the internal combustion engine? Each day it seems more obvious that the solution to the problem of gasoline shortages must be found in an alternative fuel or in a revolutionary engine. Perhaps the gap between national energy needs and corporate profit interests may soon narrow sufficiently to motivate revolutionary technology innovations. DONALD L. GILLELAND Burke, Va., May 24, 1979 A Modest Proposal for Joggers To the Editor: I have a modest proposal for joggers. In view of the energy shortage, few acts are more selfish than the jogger's waste of energy. Jogging uses not only the energy stored in food but, indirectly, the energy expended in planting, harvesting, processing, packaging and selling the food. And to what purpose? No one denies the health benefits of jogging or wishes to prevent joggers from reaping the incalculable benefits of exercise. I question only the form that this exercise takes. My proposal is simply that joggers should volunteer to perform physical tasks for those who are incapable of doing so themselves. As one example, they might volunteer to mow the lawns of the elderly, infirm and disabled. This will not, unfortunately, spare us from tiresome, self‐righteous sermons about mystic experiences. No doubt we shall soon hear from former joggers who, after mowing to the point of exhaustion, pushed themselves and their mowers through one more lawn, an extra effort that rewarded them with a glimpse of nirvana. We will know that their hearts still beat with the resonance of water pumps and their souls still shine with the glow of self‐flagellation, but — considering the altruistic nature of their deeds — we will be able to bear their martyrdom with some degree of equanimity. HERMAN H. SPITZ Princeton, N.J., May 25, 1979 To the Editor: It would be hard to top thesheer gall of the nearly one‐third of the University of Chicago faculty expressing outrage at the university's Albert Pick Jr. Award to Robert S. McNamara. In their zeal to condemn his involvement as Defense Secretary during the Vietnam War, these academicians have little moral energy to expend on behalf of the over 250,000 refugees who have risked being shot, starved, beaten and drowned fleeing from the Communist nightmare now enveloping Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. One need not defend our disastrous conduct of that war to recognize that our intentions were noble — to resist Communist aggression. The measure of our failure is seen in the tragic faces of the very young and very old who are homeless and apparently unwanted by those who display their version of compassion by howling at Mr. McNamara. If Jane Fonda was right, then perhaps the blood and tears of these refugees do not exist. Having interviewed them in Thailand and Malaysia, I beg to differ. HENRY J. HYDE Member of Congress, 6th Dist., Ill. Washington, May 22, 1979 Proportional Representation vs. National Integration To the Editor: For Harold M. Olmsted, any discrepancy between the proportion of votes cast and seats obtained by a party is a distortion in representation [letter May 17]. In reaching this conclusion he separates integration froth representation. The latter, for him, simply means a statistical census of whatever divisions there may be in a nation. In the American political tradition, representation has always been viewed as a dynamic process closely linked to integration. According to James Madison, majority voting has the task to “break and control the violence of faction.” It has done so for close to two centuries, beginning with the first elections under the Constitution, when the anti‐Federalists met their Waterloo, and extending to the racial crisis of our day, reducing the chances of all racial extremists to such an extent that even some of those who once were prominent among them, such as Governor Wallace and Senator Thurmond, have paid their tribute to a newly created national consensus. In Britain, majority voting gave Mrs. Thatcher a clear mandate to govern, avoiding the kind of uncertainty which the Netherlands had to undergo recently when nine months passed between the collapse of one government and the formation of a new one. The composition of Mrs. Thatcher's cabinet and its first working weeks do not indicate an extreme policy. Furthermore, the most prominent proponents of proportional representation in Britain expect elections under that The Times welcomes letters from readers. Letters for publication must include the writer's name, address and telephone number. Because of the large volume of mail received, we regret that we are unable to acknowledge or to return unpublished letters. system to lead to a breakup of both the Labor and the Conservative Party, with their more moderate segments then coalescing with the Liberals. How long the post‐electoral bargaining required to produce such a coalition would take is anyone's guess. Once formed, that kind of government would have to conduct a two‐front war against a substantial right and a substantial left, both of which would stand to benefit from the protest vote, of which there is a more adequate supply in present‐day Britain. Ireland and Austria had to tone down their P.R. systems considerably before the relative stability of the immediate past became possible. Furthermore, during the turbulent interwar years, according to Prof. James Hogan, Ireland was saved from “Mexican conditions” only by the fact that Mr. De Valera and his followers failed to take their seats in the Dail, giving Mr. Cosgrave an otherwise unobtainable majority. The Austria of that period did not have such luck, and the divisions of the country were to lead to dictatorship and bloody conflict. Plurality voting in its present form is, of course, not the final answer to every country's needs. The Canadian elections have demonstrated that party with a number of votes significantly smaller than its nearest rival can secure more seats. Electoral systems should be viewed as part and parcel of the political systern under which they function. The overall requirements of the parliamentary system to which both Britain and Canada adhere do demand an incentive for the voters to give their government an adequate majority. Several possible arrangements can make sure that this incentive operates to the advantage of the party with the most votes. Under certain conditions, which vary from country to country, systems can also be adopted which, while making the selections of a government with adequate strength likely, avoid the near‐monopoly of one party in certain regions. FERDINAND A. HERMENS Washington, May 24, 1979 Pregnancy Permission To the Editor: I have read with considerable interest of the rapid increase in teen‐age pregnancy and the proposal (in the Connecticut Legislature and elsewhere) that teen‐age females be denied abortions unless they have the consent of their parents. Such requirement, it is asserted, will reopen the lines of communication between the girl and her parents. This is of course debatable. Further, it does nothing to improve the situation as regards the increasing frequency of pregnancies among unmarried girls under the age of 18. The solution is really quite simple. The Legislature in Connecticut (as well as New York, New Jersey, et al.) should simply pass a law forbidding any unmarried female under the age of 18 from becoming pregnant without the prior consent of her parents. This would open lines of communication, would probably reduce the frequency of teen‐age pregnancies and would clear the way for parental approval if pregnancy did occur — or for alternative solutions to the problem. ROSS STAGNER Southfield, Mich., May 22, 1979 To the Editor: One of the most dangerously fallacious ideas being pushed by the oil industry is the notion that we can and must “increase the supply” of domestic oil. What that means actually is an increase in the rate at which we use up whatever oil lies beneath our soil. There is a fixed, limited and steadily diminishing supply — the existing reserves plus some additional fields yet to be discovered. Geologists agree on the unlikelihood that any major fields remain to be discovered and are unanimous that it would take millions of years to create new oil. The question, then, is to decide what to do with the oil that remains in our dwindling heritage. The oil companies naturally tell us that we must pump it out as fast as possible — being businesses, they would be acting suicidally to promote policies that would be for the good of the nation rather than for their immediate profits. In the long run, however, the rest of us will be benefited far more by the conservation of as much of this irreplaceable resource as possible. Petroleum is the major feedstock for our plastics industry and for much of our chemical and pharmaceutical industry as well. The one use to which most of the oil is put is the one for which it is least uniquely needed — burning it for heat and transportation. AutomobileS are being run on alcohol, which should be their major future fuel since it is renewable and could soon be offered at a competitive price.. We must bend every effort to phase out our reliance on fossil fuels and uranium and to switch as quickly as possible to renewable source of energy. An excess‐profits tax to recapture all of the windfall to the oil companies from price deregulation should be mostly devoted to easing this transition. ROBERT R. HOUT New York, May 21, 1979 The Great Bargain To the Editor: While there may be certain inconveniences associated with the present gasoline/oil situation, it is clear that we are experiencing the effects of the application of time‐honored business principles which the controllers of the petrochemical industry have been taught at our most prestigious educational institutions. Fundamentally, when there is a short supply (natural or manipulated) of a demanded commodity, the price rises. When the commodity is one to which consumers shave become addicted beyond mere dependency, the price ceiling is almost infinitely elastic. Hence we can expect the normal “laws” of economics to support gasoline prices twice or even four times their present level. Cigarettes, liquor, cosmetics, candy, automobiles and similar commodities react in the same way to the same market forces. But gasoline today is a great bargain. First, even at $1 a gallon it cheaper than any other liquid that can be purchased. Locally, even spring water from New York State costs $1.49 a gallon; soda beverages range_from $2.10 to $4 a gallon; milk is $1.75 a galIon; beer is $2.50. If one were to mail a gallon of liquid from the refineries in the Newark area to Trenton, the postage would be $2 — yet gasoline is sold at well below the “delivery” charge. Twenty years ago gasoline could. be bought for no less than 28 cents a galIon. Today it is about three times that cost. There are few commodities in America that have not increased more than three times in cost over the past 20 years. A. L. MCLEOD Trenton, May 21, 1979"
It's Primary Time,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/03/archives/new-jersey-weekly-its-primary-time-news-analysis.html,"ONE of those times when discretion is the better part of valor is just before an election, like the primaries coming up on Tuesday. The primaries have not created great deal of interest, principally because no statewide offices are at stake this year. The top ballot positions belong to the 80 men and women who hope to serve local constituencies in the State Assembly, and there is already more interest in next year's Presidential race than in the Assembly contests. Nevertheless, the elections Tuesday are important to the incumbents, and they do not want to do anything to anger potential voters, especially close to the time when they will be casting ballots. So it was not surprising when the Assembly Speaker, Christopher J. Jackman, Democrat of West New York, canceled Assembly voting sessions that fell within the shadow of the primaries. On the board for scheduled votes were bills to tighten the state abortion law and overhaul the Civil Service system, a couple of measures certain to anger as many people as they please. Pressure groups were ready to descend on the Lower House with their signs and slogans and corner the lawmakers. The lobbyists are as conscious of the election as the legislators, and they hoped to use deadline pressure to get what they wanted. The disappointment when the Assembly members struck their tents and stole away from the fight was expressed by one anti-abortion lobbyist; the lawmakers are “chicken,” he said. Probably a better public description of the typical legislator was given by legislative aide. Comparing an Assembly member to a third‐base coach on baseball team, he said, “Everyone knows he's there, but they don't know his name or exactly what he's supposed to be doing.” Anonymity can be the bane of an ambitious legislator, but around election time an incumbent likes to have a low profile, especially if the alternative is to have his or her name linked with some controversial measure. Since there are 80 Democratic and 80 Republican nominations for the Assembly on the ballot Tuesday, there is a potential for 160 contests. The fact that there are only 20 contests — 14 in the NEWS ANALYSIS Democratic party and six in the Republican — attests to the lack of interest in running, much less voting, for the legislative posts. The Democrats have a 53-to-26 majority in the Assembly. There is one vacancy, which resulted when Peter Shapiro resigned to run successfully for Essex County Executive. The real battle for control of the Lower House will not come until November, when the 80 Democrats and 80 Republicans go head-and-head with a few dozen independent candidates. Some Republicans have been predicting a takeover of the Assembly in November, but a more realistic appraisal has the G.O. P. coming closer to parity, reducing the Democratic edge to perhaps 44 to 36. The only real battle is in Camden County, where Democratic legislative and county Freeholder slates loyal to Congressman James J. Florio and to State Senator Angelo J. Errichetti are opposing each other. The challenge mounted by Mr. Florio to Mr. Errichetti, who is also the Mayor of Camden, could have a bearing on Mr. Florio's ambition to be Governor. If his bid for takeover of the party fails, Mr. Florio's chances of attracting money and political support from other parts of the state in 1981 could go a-glimmering."
Long Series of Legal Battles Plagues Doctor,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/04/archives/long-series-of-legal-battles-plagues-doctor-reimbursement-in-limbo.html,"CHICAGO, June 3 — In 1957 a Milwaukee physician named Milton Margoles challenged the Internal Revenue Service over a $33,716 civil assessment he contended he did not owe. The revenue service looked more intently at his tax files, and the civil action became a criminal case. Dr. Margoles went to prison, his tax assessment grew to more than $400,000, and the Wisconsin medical board stripped him of his license to practice medicine because of the conviction. After his release, Dr. Margoles, his wife, Betty, and his son Perry sought vigorously to clear the physician's name. By 1975 they had obtained a pardon from President Nixon, although that did not cancel the assessment, and a bill had been introduced in Congress to compensate the Margoleses. Now the 65‐year‐old physician is faced with trial on 37 charges of improperly prescribing weight control drugs to undercover Federal agents. He has a heart condition, and the stress of a long trial, a prosecution physician said in a pretrial affidavit, poses “a genuine and substantial danger of causing Dr. Margoles's sudden death notwithstanding any precautionary medical measures that might be taken.” Reimbursement in Limbo With the drug case proceeding, the Congressional. bill is in limbo, according to its sponsor, Representative Robert McClory, Republican of Illinois, in whose district Dr. Margoles lives. The measure would authorize payment of $195,000 for the “arbitrary, negligent and unduly harsh methods” used by tax agents, Mr. McClory said. When Dr. Margoles left prison, his conviction kept him from getting his license reinstated in Wisconsin. But he obtained licenses In six other states and the District of Columbia, and opened a small practice in Waukegan, Ill., just south of the Wisconsin border. The drug indictment was handed up in May 1978 after à 17‐month. Federal investigation of the Waukegan office. The Federal authorities said they would press the charges even though Dr: Margoles has ventricular tachycardia, a heart condition that some medical specialists have said could result in sudden death under sustained stress. Thomas K. McQueen, an assistant United States Attorney who is involved in the case. said Government prosecutors had decided that the charges against Dr. Margoles represented so “egregious” an offense that it was in the public interest to proceed. “It is like a nightmare from which you can't wake up,” Dr. Margoles said in a recent interview in which he, his wife and his son looked back on what they see as a 22‐year vendetta against them by Government officials and the Wisconsin Board of Medical Examiners. “It could baye been because I operated one of four doctor‐sponsored, not-forprofit hospitals in the community at a time when the medical establishment wanted doctors to be affiliated with major hospitals so they could maintain a monopoly and control prices,” Dr. Mar goles said, referring to a 65‐bed hospital he set up in 1951. “Or it could have been because I had the first fully integrated facility that had no racial restrictions on personnel or patients,” he added. “I just don't know.” The official minutes of a two‐day meeting of the Wisconsin medical board in January 1956 say that “many facets” of Dr. Margoles's “practices and activities were discussed, including suspicion of doing abortions, overcharging and doing unnecessary surgery.” “It was moved and seconded that the investigation be continued and an at tempt to obtain evidence be made to allow conviction on a felony charge to allow revocation of his license,” the minutes say. “If the preceding is not possible, try and get evidence in abortions. The motion carried.” The abortion allegation was to haunt Dr. Margoles through much of his career, although no charges were ever brought. It was a year after the 1956 meeting of the medical board that the revenue service began its actions against Dr. Margoles. The current board president, Dr. William Baker, said neither the board nor any of its members had asked the I.R.S. to investigate Dr. Margoles's finances. Dr. Margoles was sentenced to one year in jail and fined $15,000 in the tax case. The judge, the late Robert E. Tehan Sr., said Dr. Margoles had $731,000 hidden away in hidden assets, but that figure was never part of the Government's case against Dr. Margoles, and the revenue service eventually gave the doctor a letter saying it knew of no hidden assets. The judge never explained what had given him the idea that there was more money. Charged With Bribery In the 60 days he was given to wrap up his affairs before going to prison, Dr. Margoles was charged with attempting to bribe Judge Tehan with a $5,000 Treasury bond. Court testimony that Dr. Margoles might have been a victim of entrapment left jurors unconvinced, and the physician was convicted of attempting to obstruct justice — the charge was reduced from one of bribery — and sentenced to an additional six years. He was paroled after serving two years, but his troubles were far from over. While he was in prison a local hospItal labor union took control of his hospital, and his tax bill continued to grow. Mr. McQueen, the prosecutor, said the Government would have on hand at the trial the medical personnel and equipment that specialists have said should be available in case of an emergency. And he said the Government was willing to try the case in half‐day sessions to minimize the stress on Dr. Margoles. If found guilty of the charges, Dr. Margoles would face a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment and $15,000 fine on each count, Mr. McQueen said. Ellen Murphy, a spokesman for the I.R.S. in Washington, said the agency would have no comment on the physician's allegations against it."
Pope's Visit Adds to Fervor of Young Poles,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/04/archives/popes-visit-adds-to-fervor-of-young-poles-visit-increases-momentum.html,"WARSAW, June 3 — Andrzej, a 19‐yearold high‐school student, stood among the throngs of young people who turned out today for an early morning “mass for youth,” the last official function presided over by Pope John Paul II before leaving this city. As waves of applause for the Pope moved through the young crowd, Andrzej summed up his view of why religious interest among students in Poland has seemed to rise sharply in recent years. “Though we have a Socialist state and there are some good things about that,” he said, “there aren't better things invented than the Ten Commandments.” Broad disillusionment with the official Communist ideology and a longing to find traditional values are given as leading reasons for the upsurge of religious enthusiasm, though exact motives are considered complex. To some analysts, the move toward the church is a reflection of student admiration for Polish Catholicism's refusal to bow to the Communist policies that have sought to minimize the importance of the faith. Others view the revival as an inherent part of the nation's deep spiritual character. Visit Increases Momentum The Pope's visit has increased the religious momentum, especially among young people, most of whom appear to view the Pope as someone who understands them. By celebrating a special mass for them and directing his homily to student concerns, the Pope reinforced that image and gave them a challenge. “The whole world is open to you in all fields,” the Pope declared from a plat. form outside St. Anne's Church, center of a parish comprised mainly of university people. “But the question arises, who am I and what faith should I choose?” Appealing for faith in Christ, the Pope said that a person “must be measurèd by his heart and by his spirit.” Not only must society educate mathematicians and scientists, he said, “but also sons of God.” “This is what today's religion says,” he added, “that only the holy spirit can lead to the realization of a person's humanity.” The crowd listened with rapt attention. Many young couples held hands, dozens of couples cradled infants. While the excitement for the Pope among young people resembles the joy expressed by their elders, there are differences between the generations in the church that are steadily building. Role of Laity Welcomed The urban student generation, for example, is much more likely to welcome the increased role of the laity in church life, through changes instituted by the second Vatican Council, than older members of the church. Such innovations as Iay people reading portions of the mass from the lectern and assisting in distributing the communion are seen most often in less formal student settings. A new sense of equal partnership between priest and parishioners is also taking place most visibly among the students. “Young people will go hand in hand with priests,” said Jan Lipski, a young geologist who is a member of the church's intellectual circle in Warsaw. “But they will do so without going against the church.” Woiciech Ostrowski, a Catholic economist, said that in order to continue to appeal to young people, the church “must give a new kind of authority not based on don'ts and restrictions.” Slowly, the narrowing of the traditional gap between clergy and laity is giving way to greater sharing of power.’ But church people do not expect this process to move quickly, nor are most hoping that it will. Debate Over Sex Is Subdued Even in the area of sexual morality the friction that has developed in other countries between the church and secular authorities is still relatively subdued in Poland. Young people are having differences over such Issues as birth control and abortion, but these debates rarely result in open conflict. The overwhelming number of young peoples for a variety of reasons, stand behind the church. They admire its courage and consider themselves loyal Catholics, whether or not they think of themselves as practicing Catholics. The church has been increasingly conscious of young people in recent years and has looked for ways to reach them despite Government restrictions. Since church schools are prohibited, other ways must be found to teach them the faith. Methods include catechetical centers, country retreats called “oases,” and camping trips. A vigorous supporter of one phase of this outdoor program was the present Pope during his years in Poland. It was not uncommon for him to greet someone on the street with the reminder that they had once met and discussed the faith on a canoe trip."
202d Session of Legislature Is Ending Amid Great Quiet,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/06/archives/202d-session-of-legislature-is-ending-amid-great-quiet-the-talk-of.html,"ALBANY, June 5 — “I'm harried and I'm bored,” said Barbara Shack, a lobbyist for the New York Civil Liberties Union, as she slumped into a chair. “How can I be harried and bored at the same time?” The Talk of Albany It's been that way here for several weeks now —some would say for 22 weeks, since the 202d session of the New York State Legislature began. Somenow, the senate and the Assembly have managed to spend five months debating and passing more than 1,700 pieces of legislation between them while leaving the impression that virtually nothing has happened. The Legislature is now trying to give the impression that it is preparing to leave, which is supposed to trigger The Great Rush to Adjourn. The rush at least got a start today. Inside, the traditional swapping of Assembly and Senate interests resulted in agreements on school aid and a transportation bond issue. Outside, the Republicans and Democrats remained at odds with four of each party battling each other in a relay race on the Empire State Plaza. The Republicans, in matching T‐shirts, won in a big way. “We only win elections — that's all we care about,” a Democratic Assemblyman said. • There has simply been no great debate this session to roil the emotions of the 210 legislators. The leaders say many important issues have been faced — the budget, the New York City Convention Center, a big pot of money for mass transportation — but the issues were so well paced through the session that they didn't stand out as they would have in the traditional lastminute flurry of activity. Others explain that the issues of the 1970's, such as the death penalty and abortion, have got tired, and that the issues of the 80's haven't presented themselves yet. “Nobody's going broke, there's no money for any real new programs, the Governor has no urgent programs, there's no fiscal crisis of any real magnitude and there's no election,” said Assemblyman Melvin H. MIller, a Brooklyn Democrat who heads the Codes Committee. “We're in the Harding and McKinley years in the Legislature. We're keeping ourselves busy undoing things.” Assemblyman Joseph R. Lento!, Democrat‐Conservative of Brooklyn, summed the situation up more succinctly a few weeks back as the minutiae of a banking bill were debated: “This is torture,” he cried. Nevertheless, the Legislature is spending Increasing amounts of time legislating and producing fewer laws. Its leaders say this means the Legislature has become more professional. Its followers say it has become less fun. • “I am getting the sense that nobody is unhappy that we're getting ready to close down,” said Assembly Speaker Stanley FInk. It is, after all, hard to maintain the traditional demeanor of a salesmen's convention when the session shuffles on for six and seven months at a time.” “I think when they closed down the Dewitt that took a lot of that aspect out of the place,” Speaker Fink said, referring to the old Dewitt Clinton Hotel, which was closed in 1975 and has since been renovated as housing for the elderly. “It used to be you could relive each day's activities in the lobby— Republicans at the Ten Eyck, Democrats at the Dewitt. Now people are scattered. They're not together anymore, and it's different.” • One result is that the Legislature is losing some of its lifeboat mentality —its perception that it is a group unto itself floating atop the undistinguished seas of Albany. The politicians still eat together in small knots and gravitate to longtime political watering holes around town. But while many disperse to the formica‐panelled motels at Albany's periphery, growing numbers are being assimilated into the community, which is itself going through a revival. The waves created when Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller dropped his marble office complex into the center of a rundown neighborhood are subsiding. Block after block of decrepit. houses around the. Capitol are coming back as fashionable brownstones, with the help of a lot of plasterboard and cheery splashes of paint in all shades. Property values are soaring. Bistros reminiscent of Manhattan's West Side are popping up, and are regularly patronized by legislators, the permanent government — those who work fulltime for the agencies and on legislative staffs — and other well‐heeled folks from the newly chic neighborhood. Even the Bleecker — the premiere dispenser of libation to politicians and lobbyists since the demise of the Ambassador across the street from the Capitol — succumbed a few months back and built a sidewalk cafe. And in the ultimate sign of cultural rise or fall, one local radio station, WWOM‐FM, has begun pumping out a 24‐houra‐day, seven‐day‐a‐week stream of mind‐numbing disco music to the Albany citizenry. • At the Dewitt, George Chelius has restored the old hotel nightclub, with plush red velvet chairs and the original glass floor reputedly danced on by Elizabeth Taylor the night she married Mickey Hilton in 1950 and by the infamous “Legs” Diamond in the 1930's. But he waited to open “The Shelf” until late in the session, after the legislators’ drinking habits were well established elsewhere, to keep that crowd from driving away the locals. Native Albanians just don't view legislators as fun people, it seems; and with a new edginess about their public images, the legislators don't mind keeping it that way. The legislators seem acutely aware of the basic contradiction between their belief that their ministrations should be more than a sometime thing and their constituents’ more Thoreauian view that “the government is.. best which governs least.” This was made clear by Assemblyman Alan G. Hevesi, the Deputy Majority Leader, in a recent debate on whether to give New York's voters the right of. “mitiative and referendum” — allowing them to force the government into certan actions, as California voters did with Proposition 13. In a suggestion greeted with laughter and a scattering of applause, Mr. Hevesi asked his colleagues: “What if they voted to abolish the Legislature?”"
Highlights of Pope's Reign.,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/06/archives/highlights-of-popes-reign.html,"Oct. 16, 1978 — Karol Cardinal Wojtyla is elected Pope by the College of Cardinals as the 264th leader of the Roman Catholic Church. He selects the name John Paul II. Nov. 15, 1978 — Condemning abortion, the Pope tells general audience at the Vatican, that human life, is “too great, too sacred a value” to be ended by social pressure. Dec. 10, 1978 — Published reports say that a papal fact‐finding mission has gone to Beirut to look into the conflict involving the Lebanese Christians, the Syrians and the Lebanese Moslems. The Pope has previously received black nationalist leaders from southern Africa and will soon talk with Andrew Young, United States delegate to the United Nations. Before the month ends he sends a papal envoy to Buenos Aires to mediate a territorial dispute between Argentina and Chile. Jan. 24, 1979 — The Pope receives Andrei A. Gromyko, Soviet Foreign Minis ter. The Pope has said that a dialogue with Communist nations is the “only way to ease” problems. He later meets with leaders of world Jewish organizations and calls for “a fraternal dialogue and fruitful cooperation.” Jan. 25, 1979 — John Paul II chooses Latin America, where 300 million of the world's 700 million Roman Catholics live, for his first trip abroad as Pope. He stops this day in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, on his way to the third Latin American Bishops Conference. He notes that the first mass in the New World was celebrated in the Dominican Republic and the first cross placed there. Jan. 26, 1979 — Pope John Paul lands in Mexico City and kisses the ground at the airport there, as he did in Santo Domingo. He opens the conference, telling the bishops: “You are priests. You are not social or political leaders or officials of a temporal power. Don't forget that temporal leadership can easily be a source of division, while the priest should be a sign and factor of unity and fraternity.” During his seven‐day trip to Latin America he delivers 26 sermons and speeches in which he attempts, according to one view, to “wrap both the spiritual and the temporal concerns of the church under the broad heading of evangelism” —evangelism that now means saving people from tyranny and brutality as well as winning converts. March 3, 1979 — A moralistic play, “The Jewelers Shop,” written 19 years before by Karol Wojtyla under the pen name Andrzej Jawien, is translated and broadcast on Italian radio. March 15, 1979 — In his first encyclical letter, “Redeemer of Man,” Pope John Paul declares that the church must serve more effectively as “the guardian of freedom.” The encyclical says “the church must in no way be confused with the political community nor bound to any political system.” The encyclical also deplores social inequities and ends with a tribute to the central role of the Virgin Mary. April 3, 1979 — The Pope condemns “When I See God,” a book by Jacques Pohier, a priest. This condemnation is the first since the church stopped banning books in 1967. The Pope says the book denies both the bodily resurrection of Jesus and the teaching authority of the Scriptures, and includes dangerous and ambiguous statements about papal infallibility. April 9, 1979 — The Pope urges all Roman Catholic priests, of whom there are some 500,000, to keep their commitment to celibacy. Do not ask, he says in a 10,000 word letter written in a disciplinary vein, to be removed from vows “at moments of crisis.” It is, he says, “a matter of keeping one's word to Christ and to the church.” Earlier in his reign, he has urged nuns to wear distinctive habits and not secular dress. Later in the month, the Pope rallies priests engaged in . pastoral work in labor organizations to strive so that “the gap between the church and the factory narrows and that the fumes of incense mix with those of industry.” June 2, 1979 — John Paul receives tumultuous welcome in Warsaw as he begins his visit to Poland, the‐first trip any Pope has made to a Communist country."
Conference Focus: Teen‐age Pregnancy,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/06/archives/conference-focus-teenage-pregnancy.html,"RACINE, Wis., June 5 (AP) — In a three‐day conference here aimed at reducing the number of unwanted teenage pregnancies, about 50 professionals from organizations aiding young people emphasized the needs for dealing with sex education early and helping adolescents understand the difference between sexual relations and love. Any attempt to solve the problem must deal with the concept that sex training should begin with preadolescence, said Mary S. Calderone of New York, president of the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States. She was one of 50 representatives of national youth‐serving organizations and sex educators from private and government agencies who attended the conference, which ended today. “People don't go into pregnancy without a motive of sexual pleasure,” she said, “and adolescents don't just become sexual — it is a matter of birth. The sexual system is functioning before birth. “If we are going to talk about peventive measures, then we have to talk about preadolescence,” said Mrs. Calderone, who is 75 and a great‐grandmother. “Trying to teach birth control is too little, too late.” For those who might feel that her ideas are radical, Mrs. Calderone suggested that they only seemed radical because they were based on research conducted within the last seven years. The conference was faced with some alarming statistics regarding teen‐age pregnancies: More than a million teenagers — 30,000 of them under 15 years of age — become pregnant every year; 27 percent of these pregnancies terminate in induced abortions and 31 percent result in out‐of‐wedlock births; 28 percent result in births after marriages, and 19 percent in miscarriages. Sol Gordon, the director of child and family studies at the Institute for Family Research and Education at Syracuse University, which sponsored the conference, said: “I think we haven't understood the real goals of family life education, and that's why we haven't had a lot of success.” Dr. Gordon said high school students wanted answers to questions such as, “How can I tell when I'm really in love?” Sex educators, he said, have not been able to get across the message that “sex is not really a test of love.” He questioned whether a 10 percent reduction in teen‐age pregnancies might be achieved if girls were taught how to respond to boys when they say such things as, “If you really love me, you'll have sex with me.” Dr. Gordon said a girl could respond, “If you really love me, you wouldn't put this kind of pressure on me.” Or if a boy should tell a girl, “If I don't have sex with you I'll go crazy,” Dr. Gordon said, the girl could respond, “Go” or “That's a line.” The conference participants also emphasized the dangers of venereal disease among teen‐agers engaged in sexual intercourse. The meeting concluded with a call for Congressional support for funds to combat unwanted teen‐age pregnancies and for health care."
Theater: Kevin Kline Stars in ‘Loose Ends’,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/07/archives/theater-kevin-kline-stars-in-loose-ends-after-the-60s.html,"” L00SE ENDS” is in many respects a well‐made play; it is absorbing for a good deal of the time; it is often funny; it is acted with considerable distinction; and yet at its heart it is a statistic. Written by Michael Weller, author of “Moonchildren,” it traces the aging of two free spirits of the 60's into what passes for maturity and success in the 70's The fate of the young couple who met,while wandering the world, on a beach in Bali, is to catch just about every possible well‐to‐do malaise around except mugging. Mr. Weller's message seems to be that life for the idealists and flower children of a decade ago has become very flat as they settled into the pragmatic privacies of prosperity. Amid a good deal of graceful and perceptive writing, the problem of “Loose Ends,” which opened last night at the Circle In The Square, is that the play comes to share the flatness that is its theme. It begins with Paul, a disillusioned former Peacecorpsman, and Susan, who is traveling to find herself, discovering each other on a tropical beach. It is a graceful scene, this show‐and‐tell at the beginning of a love affair. He speaks amusingly of digging latrines for natives who were politely sympathetic, thinking it must be a form of punishment. She tells of getting hold of the remains of her tonsillectomy, as a child, and holding a funeral service for them. Mr. Weller is shrewd in this and other early scenes as the couple, with all the freedom of youth upon them, meet again in Boston, and settle down in an uncomplicated style. He does a little work as a film editor, while making fun of an ambitious, businessman brother; she takes pictures with a camera she has bought. The shrewdness lies in the fact that even at the start the author never idealizes the couple. Played with winning charm by Kevin Kline and Roxanne Hart, the mark of the ordinary is nevertheless upon them. Paul's disillusion with the Peace Corps is fatuous as well as amusing; his mockery of his go‐getter brother borders on petulance. Susan's elfish romanticism is barely skin‐deep: she has carefully bought up Asian curios to pay for the camera that will start her off an a successful career. She goes to New York to work; he follows rather plaintively, but takes up a career of his own and prospers. Their exuberance with each other dwindles; he wants a baby, she doesn't. Eventually she has an abortion; they are divorced. They have a final brief reunion in a cabin in New Hampshire but, with a symmetry that is more deadly than fearful, both have taken up halfhearted new attachments and at the end he is alone, staring at the slides of their marriage. After the 60's LOOSE ENDS, by Michael Weller. Directed by Alan Schneider; setting by Zack Brown; costumes by Kristina Watson; lighting by David F. Segal; photographs by Cecilia Vettralno; hairstyles by Michael Wasula. Presented by Circle In the Square, Theodore Mann, artistic director, Paul LIbin, managing director. At 51st Street, west of Broadway.  Mr. Weller has managed to suggest that even at the start their grace was superficial, owing most of its strength to their youth and beauty. This is fine; but as the strains of aging, prosperity and urban living come upon them, their ordinariness makes them less and less objects of dramatic interest, and the play begins to die. Their quarrels in the second act are not much more than recitations of fashionable contemporary symptoms. They become case‐histories: the things that happen to them make them recognizable but not much If Mr. Weller, perhaps purposely, has not made them interesting, he has written them with sympathy; as well as with wit and a good ear. Of his minor characters, some are simply caricatures — the backslapping brother, a dumb childhood friend of Susan's — but others are effective. Jay O. Sanders and Celia Weston are both very good as a comically eccentric couple who have dropped back in after having dropped out but keep all their exuberance while doing so. Jodi Long uses silence with telling effect as a friend in whom both Paul and Susan confide. The two principals are both very fine. Mr. Klein is agile and perplexed; he constructs a genuine charm out of shallowness and if his suffering is ordinary it is touching, nevertheless. Miss Hart ages remarkably, from exuberant youth to a warm‐hearted but wretched maturity. Alan Schneider's direction is firstrate, and so is Zack Brown's setting. The stage of the Circle, so frequently awkward, is used with complete naturalness and vivid effect."
Canon Dennis Elected New Suffragan Bishop Of Episcopal Diocese,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/07/archives/canon-dennis-elected-new-suffragan-bishop-of-episcopal-diocese.html,"Canon Walter D. Dennis, who is known for his strong stands on civil rights for homosexuals and on legalized abortion and marijuana use, won an upset election as suffragan bishop of the Episcopal diocese of New York yesterday. He easily defeated three official nominees and two others. The 46‐year‐old Canon Dennis, a black, has been a program administrator at the diocesan headquarters. He will succeed Bishop Harold Wright, who died June 11, 1978. The post of suffragan bishop is the third highest post at the diocese, which encompasses Manhattan, Staten Island, the Bronx and six counties north of the city. Although he has been canon at the diocese since 1965, Canon Dennis had not been nominated by an official diocesan committee earlier this year. But he was put into nomination from the floor yesterday and was seconded by many priests, several of whom said they often disagreed with him but trusted him. Canon Dennis won with 341 of 547 votes cast on the third ballot. Female Priest Nominated Also nominated from the floor was the Rev. Mary Michael Simpson, who was one of the first women to be an Episcopal priest, and who last year became the first woman priest to preach at Westminster Abbey in London. By being nominated yesterday, she became the first woman ever nominated for bishop in the United States, but she gained only around 10 percent of the vote. After his election, Canon Dennis said: “I must be careful to delineate when I am speaking for myself and when I am speaking for the church. I will go around the diocese for a year to listen. People already know where I stand on the issues.” Canon Dennis has often spoken out on issues while an official at the cathedral. He has been a leader in the campaign to legalize marijuana and has supported acceptance of homosexuals in the church."
HARTFORD ASSEMBLY ENDS ITS ‘79 SESSION,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/07/archives/hartford-assembly-ends-its-79-session-high-points-included.html,"HARTFORD, June 6 — The 1979 session of the General Assembly drifted to adjournment today, six weeks after the main work of writing a budget and a school‐aid package was completed, ending months of inconclusive wrangling over a variety of issues that attracted little public interest. The absence of legislation in certain areas may represent the most important decisions of the lawmakers. The House majority leader, John G. Groppo, tersely stated the consensus on the most important nondevelopment: “No taxes.” Filling Gov. Ella T. Grasso's campaign promise of no new or increased taxes, the Appropriations Committee made few changes in her budget before the House and Senate passed a $2.4 billion spending package, only 5.5 percent above last year. As Mrs. Grasso noted in her adjournment speech, it was “one of the lowest increases among all the states.” The other major piece of work, which seems to have avoided the predicted legal fight, was the passage of a program to equalize school financing, which was ordered by the Connecticut Supreme Court when it struck down the local property tax as the basis for school financing. The first phase will cost the state $34 million next year. Coastal‐Area Bill Passed Another important legislative achievement was the passage of a long‐debated coastal‐area management bill.. The legislation is meant to rationalize the use of Connecticut's remaining undeveloped waterfront, conserving some and minimizing adverse environmental impact. But much of the remainder of the session failed to attract widespread interest. As in Albany, Connecticut legislators found few issues of strong interest to the general public. “The people are saying ‘We’ve got enough laws. Get off our backs and stop legislating,’ “said Mr. Groppo. Two bills prompted drawn‐out legislative battles. One would have required parental consent before a minor could have an abortion, a regulation that enemies of abortion unsuccessfully sought. The other would have raised the drinking age, an action that had the approval of school officials, who said that 18‐yearolds were buying liquor at package stores for their younger friends. But the Senate split the drinking age to 18 for bars and 19 for off‐premises, prompting the Governor to exercize her first veto of the session, on the ground that the law might be unconstitutional. The Debate Over Two Bills Other major changes in bills on arson and “workfare” also failed to materialize. The original arson bill would have stiffened penalties but it was amended establish the electric chair for arsonists whose fires took innocent lives. In a long debate filled with badly drawn amendments, lawmakers tacked on changes establishing capital punishment for mass murder and other crimes, and the original bill was nicknamed the “Omnibus Death bill.” Finally, all reference to capital punishment was eliminated and the measure became law. The “workfare” measure, a largely symbolic bill that would have required some welfare recipients to take jobs in return for stipends averaging $45 a week, died in a shuffle between the houses, but not before the House speaker had smashed a hole in a wooden plate while gaveling the chamber to order. The legislature also re‐organized the supervision of legalized gambling, and that part of the bureaucracy dealing with housing. But there was little enthusiasm at the end of the 70's for what in the 60's were called “social‐conscience” issues. Welfare Benefits Up 5% Welfare benefits, for example, were increased by 5 percent in a year when the price of necessities may rise three times that much. And the General Assembly was stopped only by the veto of the Governor from delaying for a year a requirement that passenger‐car emissions be inspected annually as a part of the registration procedure. “We neither went very much forward of very much backward,” said Joan Kemler, assistant majority leader of the House. Then the West Hartford Democrat, perhaps with an eye to the fiscal uncertainty which hangs over the state's future, added, “We didn’t take a dramatic look at the programs that could be eliminated or cut back.”"
Abortion Foe Will Seek Presidential Nomination,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/08/archives/abortion-foe-will-seek-presidential-nomination.html,"WASHINGTON, June 7 (AP) — Sean Morton Downey, an anti‐abortion activist, declared his candidacy today for the 1980 Democratic Presidential nomination. He said that the leadership had turned the Democrats into “the party of death.” Mr. Downey is the first candidate to enter the Democratic race. President Carter has not officially declared his candidacy for a second term but is expected to do so. Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California is considered likely to challenge Mr. Carter, and a number of liberal Democrats are trying to draft Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who insists he intends to support Mr. Carter. At a news conference, Mr. Downey denounced all three for leading the party “far, far to the left.” Mr. Downey worked briefly as a fund raiser for Mr. Carter in the 1976 campaign but resigned to protest what he regarded as the pro‐abortion stand of the party platform. His candidacy was endorsed by Paul Brown, director of the Life Amendment Political Action Committee. Mr. Downey is chairman of the group and also has served as chief lobbyist for the National Right to Life Committee. The 46‐year‐old resident of Nevada was born in New York City and is the son of Morton Downey, the tenor, and Barbara Bennett, the actress."
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/09/archives/letters-to-aid-private-schools-without-aiding-religion.html,"To the Editor: The U.S. Supreme Court's decision not to allow tax credit for parents with children in private schools is a severe blow to those struggling parents who would like to have their children educated in a school atmosphere that includes an awareness of an active belief in God, a keener sense of discipline and instruction in traditional values and concepts. It is easy to see why the Court decided as it did. To give a tax credit for overall education of a child would include a tax credit for the teaching of subjects that either are religious in content or border on religion. Any attempt to give a tax break would, it seems to me, present this dilemma. It would seem, however, that some plan could be worked out whereby a portion (let us say two‐thirds) of the salaries of the mostly underpaid private‐school teachers of subjects not related to religion could be picked up by the education branch of the state or of the Federal Government. Right now the private schools receive textbook aid, lunch‐room help and bus transportation. There could well be a prohibition against including any reference to religion in those classes that are goyernment‐helped, and violators would lose government support. If there were reluctance to give such an outright grant to an individual school, I am sure a formula could be worked out whereby a specific amount (let us say $200 or $300 a child) could be apportioned to the parents of privateschool children. The school would then be in a position to give teachers (approved by the state through certification, etc.) a more equitable salary and at the same time ease the burden on some long‐suffering parents. Religious schools are not interested in violating any church/state prohibitions in our Constitution. We realize that the public schools do a fine job. We think there is a place, too, in the total educational system for another choice by parents, the private school, to educate youngsters who will also become good American adults. (Rev.) TIMOTHY LYONS Pt. Pleasant Beach, N.J., May 31, 1979 A Wall Worth Keeping To the Editor: The Supreme Court's decision invalidating a New Jersey law allowing for tax credits for parochial‐school parents was a reinforcement of the “wall of separation between church and state.” As a Roman Catholic who supports that wall of separation, I believe that no one who sends his children to parochial schools should ask other taxpayers to pay part of the bill. Public schools are open to all. If parents elect not to use the public schools, that is their business. No one forces them not to use them. Parochial‐school parents claim that they are doubly taxed. That is sheer nonsense. What about single people without children and childless couples and couples with children already out of school? They do not use the public schools, yet they are taxed in the same manner as parochial‐school parents. The Supreme Court's “strict construction” of the First Amendment is blessing to this nation, a nation whose contribution of church/state separation has kept it free of religious strife for over 200 years. No one wants this country to become another Iran or Northern Ireland with their religious conflicts. LOUIS A. CARRUBBA Brooklyn, June 2, 1979 A Golden Future for Oil Producers To the Editor: A profound change in the world's balance of wealth is now taking place. The paper dollars which are pouring into the treasuries of OPEC nations are being quietly exchanged for gold bars in London and Zurich. The finance ministers of the oilproducers are wise to trade their surplus dollars for gold. They have all the London hotels, Beverly Hills real estate and Rolls Royces they need. They are reluctant to tie up more wealth in paper U.S. Treasury bills. Throughout history, gold has proven to be the only money of lasting value. It is a store of wealth which will always keep pace with government‐induced (via deficit spending) inflation. Until now, this country has merely printed the excess dollars needed to pay for oil imports. We had no problem as long as the oil producers bought U.S Government bonds and made‐inU.S.A. weapons and planes with the dollars. However, with more and more gold being added to the coffers of the oil‐producing nations, the Western world had better take a long, hard look at this shift in the world's balance of monetary power. Long after their oil wells run dry, the OPEC nations will have gold wealth to exchange for their future needs. EDWARD DORSON New York, June 1, 1979 Roben Nenbroken To Obviate Abortions To the Editor: If all those vehement “right‐tolifers” gave half as much effort to the welfare of infants as they do in their concern for fetuses, it would no doubt make a considerable dent in the numDer of abortions needed. J. C. FAHY Hampton, N.H., May 27, 1979 Constitutional God To the Editor: Isaac Bashevis Singer's account of his personal ‘religion [Op‐Ed May 18] suggests a political analogy which may explain why so many people have ceased to believe in God altogether. Mr. Singer rejects the revealed God of the traditional religions and sets forth the specifications of a concept of God he could accept. This God is possessed of many admirable qualities, but, as Mr. Singer admits with disarming candor, He may be an idol and He may not exist at all. The reader, however, is left to wonder why He should exist at all, since He is so transparently — and avowedly — a creation of His author, and serves no purpose other than to fill the vacuum left by the discarded God of revelation. The revealed God of traditional religion, as Mr. Singer recognizes, is modeled on a king, an absolute monarch who rules by divine right and is not accountable to His subjects. Mr. Singer proposes to substitute a constitutional monarch, a benevolent and enlightened patron of the arts and sciences; but he still leaves Him some properties of the absolute monarch, such as a refusal to hold press conferences. Americans decided long ago that a better alternative to an absolute monarch is an elected President who is accountable to the people; and a constitutional monarch appeals to them only as a tourist attraction. A God constructed on this model is an idol of the theater. GEORGE S. HENDRY Princeton, N.J., May 21, 1979 Sole Ulster Solution To the Editor: Presumably, John Carroll's proposal to “shame Britain” [letter May 72] represents the view of the United Irish Counties Association, of which he is president. I am sure this idea would be of no great help to the members of the minority in the Six Counties, who are trying to survive despite the indifference of their fellow countrymen who live in the free 26 counties, the intolerance of their religious neighbors in the Six Counties and the pretended alootness of the English Government (“Really hornfied, don't you know, at the awful mess!”). After 500 years it seems silly to suggest shaming Britain. There would never have been a U.S.A. if England could be shamed. The solution still seems obvious — England must go. George Washington knew that. And Lincoln insisted on our unity. ED CAROLAN Brooklyn, June 1, 1979 Wrong Label for an S.E.C. Commissioner To the Editor: Ia a May 14 news article concerning S.E.C. Chairman Harold M. Williams, I was referred to as a “conservative.” This is at least the second time I have been so categorized by The Times [see issue of Feb. 20]. In general, I object to labels because I do not think they are useful indicators of a person's views or abilities. In this instance, I feel that the label you are using in regard to me is both inappropriate and misleading. Since I took public office I have been urging a re‐examination of the commission's policies in a number of areas, stressing the need for regulatory reform. Many leading proponents of regulatory reform, both in and outside government, have impeccable “liberal” credentials. Further, when deregulation is directed at certain industries by certain agencies, for example, the C.A.B. or the I.C.C. it is commonly regarded as a “liberal” policy. When I express those same principles as a commissioner at the S.E.C., it is illogical and inappropriate to label me a “conservative.” Unfortunately, I believe you are making judgments from the vantage point of how well or poorly ideas are received by the business community and the Federal bureaucracy, rather than in terms of what is being argued about prosecutorial power and the formulation and implementation of regulatory policy. On a ,certain level it does not,really matter what labels are attached to ideas because if thes ideas are valid they will prevail. At the same time, the general public receives much of its information about government from the press. Accordingly, I hope that in any future articles concerning me, you will think twice before pigeonholing me into a category which is overly simplistic and in which I do not believe I belong. ROBERTA S. KARMEL Washington, May 25,1979 Society's Stake in the Treatment of Alcoholics Who Kill To the Editor: Twice in 12 years now, legal executions have touched off widespread public debate on the morality of capital punishment. In all the discussions, however, we have heard no reference to the fact that at least two‐thirds of all homicides — some say considerably more than two‐thirds — are directly associated with alcohol abuse. Certainly these two were. If this fact is incorporated into the debate on capital punishment, it changes somewhat the terms of the debate. The most reputable medical and psychological authorities today tell us that alcoholism is a disease, and a treatable disease. The first principle of treatment in this disease is that the alcoholic must face up to the consequences of his alcoholic behavior. Thus, one question is whether an appropriate consequence of alcohol‐related homicide is capital punishment. A second question involves capital punishment as a deterrent to crime. We can say that no threat of punishment ever seems to deter the active alcoholic from drinking, no matter how violent or bizarre his behavior under the influence of alcohol has been in the past. Without entering into a debate on capital punishment, however, we would like to point out that there is a moral issue here which should be much more widely discussed and acted upon by our legislators. When a man or a woman has been imprisoned for a violent crime committed as part of a pattern of drinking behavior, it is irresponsible for society to let him or her spend two or 20 years in prison, with or without other programs of “rehabilitation,” then release him or her back into the community without treatment for alcoholism. As matters now stand, the state correctional institutions are releasing 2,000 to 3,000 such prisoners annually — perhaps more, as no adequate statistics exist — back into the community. These people are major contributors to the recidivism rate. We are happy to report, however, that the present top leadership of both New York State's Department of Correctional Services and the Division of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse are very much aware of this situation and are anxious to take effective action. What is lacking is the understanding and willingness of the State Legislature to appropriate funds to either of these departments to mount significant programs in the prisons. We have growing evidence now, based largely on cooperation between these departments and our voluntary efforts, that alcohol treatment programs in prison can work and can greatly reduce both the financial and the human costs of alcoholic behavior that leads to criminal acts. It is time for the makers of public policy to give serious attention to this neglected and poorly understood social problem. DAVID W.

Joan Didion: Staking Out California,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/10/books/didion-calif.html,"In her new book, ""The White Album,"" Joan Didion writes: ""Kilimanjaro belongs to Ernest Hemingway. Oxford, Mississippi, belongs to William Faulkner... a great deal of Honolulu has always belonged for me to James Jones... A place belongs forever to whoever claims it hardest, remembers it most obsessively, wrenches it from itself, shapes it, renders it, loves it so radically that he remakes it in his image.""   California belongs to Joan Didion.  Not the California where everyone wears aviator sunglasses, owns a Jacuzzi and buys his clothes on Rodeo Drive. But California in the sense of the West. The old West where Manifest Destiny was an almost palpable notion that was somehow tied to the land and the climate and one's own family-an unspoken belief that was passed down to children in stories and sayings. Joan Didion's California is a place defined not so much by what her unwavering eye observes, but by what her memory cannot let go. Although her essays and novels are set amid the effluvia of a new golden state peopled by bored socialites, lost flower children and unsentimental engineers, all is measured against the memory of the old California. And in telling what has happened to California in the past few decades, Didion finds a metaphor for some larger, insidious process at work in American society. The theatrics of James Pike, Episcopal Bishop of California, became a parable of the American penchant for discarding history and starting tabula rasa; the plight of a San Bernardino woman accused of murdering her husband, a lesson in misplaced dreams. The California Joan Didion lives in, though, is very much the latter-day California. Brentwood Park is one of those sedate residential sections of Los Angeles; her street, one that is lined with Tudor-style homes, white Colonials and pillared mansions. Didion is sitting in the den. The rooms of her house possess all the soothing order and elegance of a Vogue photo spread: sofas covered in floral chintz, lavender love seats the exact color of the potted orchids on the mantelpiece, porcelain elephant end tables, and dozens of framed pictures of family and friends.  Still, this is the kind of day that can give Joan Didion a migraine. In the first place, there is car trouble: Her husband's new pearl gray Jaguar was dented this morning by a neighbor pulling out of her driveway, and her own 1969 yellow Corvette Sting Ray-a Corvette exactly like the one Maria drove in ""Play It As It Lays""-needs a new transmission. Then there are the rats. ""The exterminator took one look at the backyard and said we were sure to have rats in the avocado tree,"" she says. ""That's when I started thinking about bubonic plague."" Today, though, it isn't so much the rats or the cars that are bothering Didion. It's the dining-room curtains: instead of gathering the new curtains, the decorator has pleated them. The perfect geometric regularity of those folds triggers migraines, she thinks. She is making a new set of curtains herself. Wearing a faded blue sweatshirt over brown corduroy levis, Didion at 44 strikes anyone who sees her for the first time as the embodiment of the women in her novels"" like Lily McClellan in ""Run River,"" she is ""strikingly frail"" (Didion is 5 feet 2, and weighs 95 pounds); like Maria in ""Play It As It Lays,"" she used to chain-smoke and wear chiffon scarves over her red hair; and like Charlotte in ""A Book of Common Prayer,"" she possesses ""an extreme and volatile thinness... she was a woman... with a body that masqueraded as that of a young girl."" There is a certain sadness in the face that indicates a susceptibility to what she calls ""early morning dread""; even indoors, she wears oversized sunglasses to protect her light-sensitive eyes. An almost Southern softness lingers in her voice-she identifies it as an Okie accent picked up in Sacramento high schools-and bright laughter punctuates her unfinished sentences. It is a voice so soft, so tentative at times, that one frequently has to strain to hear her.  The ""Didion woman"" has by now become a recognizable literary figure. Women who have misunderstood the promises of the past, they are habitues of a clearly personal wasteland, wandering along highways or through countries in an effort to blot out the pain of consciousness. They lose their men to suicide, divorce and cancer; their children to abortion, bad genes and history. They are outsiders, but they are also survivors, fatalists who keep on playing the game regardless of the odds. In her highly praised collection of essays, ""Slouching Towards Bethlehem,"" Didion meticulously portrayed herself as one also well acquainted with the edge. She wrote of ""bad nerves,"" of drinking ""gin and hot water to blunt the pain and... Dexedrine to blunt the gin."" Something of a sequel to that first anthology, ""The White Album,"" which will be published June 17 by Simon & Schuster, is a collection of her best work from Life, Esquire, The Saturday Evening Post, The New York Times and The New York Review of Books. Novelist and poet James Dickey has called Didion ""the finest woman prose stylist writing in English today."" And she has created, in her books, one of the most devastating and distinctive portraits of modern America to be found in fiction or nonfiction-a portrait of America where ""disorder was its own point."" A gifted reporter with an eye for the telling detail-the frayed hem, the shaking hand-she is also a prescient witness, finding in her own experiences parallels of the times. The voice is always precise, the tone unsentimental, the view unabashedly subjective. She takes things personally. The title of the new book comes, of course, from the Beatles' ""White Album,"" a record Didion found ominous and disturbing, an album inextricably connected to the Manson Murders and the dissonance of the 60's. Didion's own ""White Album"" contains a number of images from the Manson years: Linda Kasabian awaiting trial in a dress Didion bought for her at I. Magnin; Huey Newton lecturing the press on the ""American capitalistic-materialistic system""; students at San Francisco State College breaking the tedium of the academic calendar with a campus revolt. ""The White Album,"" though, is not solely concerned with the 60's. Or, for that matter, with Didion's alienation. Whereas Yeats's poem ""The Second Coming"" (""Things fall apart; the center cannot hold..."") served as a perfect epigraph for ""Slouching Towards Bethlehem,"" no such image exists to sum up ""The White Album."" This second volume of essays is not so absolute in its tragic vision of the world, not so unquestioningly bleak about history. As Didion herself puts it, ""The White Album"" is more tentative. I don't have as many answers as I did when I wrote 'Slouching.'"" ""The White Album"" includes a brilliant essay on Hollywood as ""the last extant stable society""; a tribute to Georgia O'Keeffe, and a charming portrait of one Amando Vazquez, a Mexican gardener who raises orchids in Malibu. The collection, in fact, demonstrates Didion's range as an essayist, her ability not only to portray the extraordinary and apocalyptic, but also to appreciate the ordinary. ""I am alienated,"" explains Didion, ""I would say I am a victim. But you don't live every day of your life walking around talking about how alienated you are-you'll start sounding like Woody Allen's 'Interiors.'"" Both Didion and her husband, John Gregory Dunne, the author of ""Vegas,"" ""True Confessions"" and ""Quintana & Friends,"" have made their lives the subject of their reportage. Their thoughts on divorce, their adoption of their daughter, Quintana, and their nervous breakdowns have all been meticulously chronicled in print. The candor frequently stuns. ""[In person] Joan gives everyone the impression of being very private,"" observes Ralph Graves, now editorial director of Time Inc. who was editor of Life magazine when Didion wrote her column. ""Then she'll turn around and write this inside-of-the-stomach stuff that you'd think you'd need to know her five years to find out. This mousy, thin, quiet woman tells you as much about herself as Mailer."" For Didion, though, it is merely part of the contract a writer makes with the reader: as she once told her husband, ""If you want to write about yourself, you have to give them something."" Why has she chosen this relentless self-scrutiny? One suspects that writing holds for her a kind of talismanic power-the process of putting her life on paper somehow helps to exorcise private demons. Writing, after all, is a means of creating a momentary stay against confusion, of making order out of disorder, understanding out of fear.  In her newest book, Didion does not shirk from exposing herself. ""You are getting a woman who somewhere along the line misplaced whatever slight faith she ever had in the social contract, in the meliorative principle... I have felt myself a sleepwalker... alert only to the stuff of bad dreams, the children burning in the locked car in the supermarket parking lot... I have trouble maintaining the basic notion that keeping promises matters in a world where everything I was taught seems beside the point."" She tells us how she went blind for six weeks from a condition diagnosed as multiple sclerosis (the disease has been in remission for the past seven years), and how, in the summer of 1968, she checked into the psychiatric clinic at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica. She even tells us the doctor's diagnosis: ""Patient's thematic productions emphasize her fundamentally pessimistic, fatalistic and depressive view of the world around her..."" Yet this familiar Didion persona masks a writer whose own life is a wealth of contradictions. She is a Westerner who mourns the passing of the frontier ethic, but lives in Los Angeles because the city amuses her. She is a romantic who believes ""that salvation [lies] in promises made and somehow kept outside the range of normal social experience,"" but delights in practical, domestic routines. She is an introvert who says she has always been an outsider, but parties with the biggest names in Hollywood. She is a writer who has dwelled on the atomization of modern society, but maintains what she describes as a ""boring, bourgeois"" life. Didion's friends jokingly refer to her as the ""Kafka of Brentwood Park,"" which amuses her husband no end. ""Joan's really a rather cheerful person who drives a bright yellow Corvette,"" says Dunne. ""In person, she doesn't have a dark view of life. She just doesn't expect a lot from it or from people."" Dunne, a large, gregarious man, gives the appearance of managing Didion's life. He tends to do most of the talking, frequently answering questions directed at Didion; he always answers the phones and screens the calls. But, according to their friends, it is Didion who handles all their finances and Didion who smoothes over situations created by Dunne's volatile temper. ""John does not play Leonard Woolf to her Virginia,"" notes writer Josh Greenfeld, one of the Dunnes' best friends in Los Angeles. ""She's more John's Leonard Woolf. John may seem strident and tough, but what you see in John you get in Joan. She is every bit as tough as he is."" Another friend described Didion as ""fragile,"" as in the phrase, ""a fragile, little stainless-steel machine."" Didion, too, thinks of herself as an optimist. Hers is an optimism somewhat akin to F. Scott Fitzgerald's definition of a first-rate intelligence: ""the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function."" To believe that nothing matters and yet to believe more strongly that it is worth making a record of experience anyway."" Her awareness of ""the edge"" is, in part, a literary idea that derives from what seized her imagination as a child. The people she read about in the fiction of Conrad, James and Faulkner convinced a young Didion that ""salvation lay in extreme and doomed commitments,"" and later provided models for the characters in her own novels. ""I have a theatrical temperament,"" explains Didion. ""I'm not interested in the middle road-maybe because everyone's on it. Rationality, reasonableness bewilder me. I think it comes out of being a 'daughter of the Golden West.' A lot of the stories I was brought up on had to do with extreme actions-leaving everything behind, crossing the trackless wastes, and in those stories the people who stayed behind and had their settled ways-those people were not the people who got the prize. The prize was California."" We are in a flight from Los Angeles to Sacramento, where Didion's parents live. As the plane circles ver the coast toward the valley, Didion turns to look out the window. It kills me when people talk about California hedonism,"" she says deliberately. ""Anybody who talks about California hedonism has never spent a Christmas in Sacramento."" Didion's family-five generations on her mother's side-come from Sacramento. Although it is the state capital, it remains a valley town where the summers are hot and plagued by drought, and where the winters are cold and menaced by flood. The land here is flat, the rivers and fields stretching clean to the horizon. It is, in short, a landscape of extremes. In writing of the Sacramento of her childhood, Didion frequently uses the word ""Eden,"" and to the early settlers it probably was-or at least a reasonable facsimile of Paradise. The confluence of the muddy, silt-rich Sacramento and the swiftly flowing American made the region a fertile garden. It is only within the past three decades that the cultivated fields have given way to tract housing, subdivisions and aerospace factories; the dusty roads along the levee to eight-lane freeways. Even as we drive through town, Didion peruses a map provided by the rent-a-car company. She is unaccustomed to finding her way home via the new highways, for the Sacramento she knows so well is a town of the past. ""All that is constant about the California of my childhood is the rate at which it disappears,"" she wrote in ""Slouching Towards Bethlehem."" ""California is a place in which a boom mentality and a sense of Chekhovian loss meet in uneasy suspension."" The road leading to the Didions' Tudor house once ran through hop fields; today it is flanked by a thriving industrial park. Inside, their living room is a comfortable assemblage of mementos and assorted knickknacks collected by Eduene Jerrett Didion at local craft fairs. A small forthright woman, she met John Dunne for the first time at her daughter's wedding and told him: ""You know those little old ladies in tennis shoes you've heard about? Well, I'm one of them."" Her husband is a quiet, shy man. A former Army Air Corps officer who later served on the Sacramento draft board, Frank Didion now dabbles in real estate. Joan's bedroom is still the faded carnation pink she painted it when she was a freshman at Berkeley, but bougainvillea and ivy have overgrown the windows, giving the chamber a dark, cavelike effect. Didion returned to this room to finish each of her five books. She wrote the last 150 pages of ""A Book of Common Prayer: here in 14 days. After all, there are no distractions in Sacramento: the phones are answered, the meals are prepared, and her parents leave her alone to work. On a dressing table here, as in her study back in Brentwood, there is a small framed photograph of the Sierras near Donner Pass. The tale of the Donner party haunts Didion. Traveling from Illinois to California in 1846, the Donner-Reed party was forced by a sudden blizzard to encamp in the Sierras. Faced with starvation, they ate their own dead. Of the 87 who embarked, 40 survived. Joan's great-great-great-grandmother, Nancy Hardin Cornwall, was a member of the original Donner party, but she had left the ill-fated group at Humboldt Sink in Nevada to cut north through Oregon.  Nancy Hardin Cornwall's own forebears lived on the frontier, moving from the Carolinas to Georgia to Arkansas to Missouri with the nation's westward migration, and Didion clings to that heritage. ""I used to be strongly convinced that the closing of the frontiers was the central event, the turning point in American history,"" she says. ""I am not flatly convinced of that anymore, but I myself feel better the farther west I am."" The frontier legacy, she feels, has made her different, has ingrained in her a kind of hard-boiled individualism, an ""ineptness at tolerating the complexities of postindustrial life."" And it has made her something of a libertarian, wary of governmental panaceas and distrustful of utopian promises. Like her parents, Didion voted for Goldwater in 1964. Since then, she has voted only twice. ""I never had faith that the answers to human problems lay in anything that could be called political,"" she explained once. ""I thought the answers, if there were answers, lay someplace in man's soul."" Joan was a fearful child-scared of ski lifts, of rattlesnakes in the river, even of comic books filled as they were with violence and monsters. She worried that the funicular at Royal Gorge would crash, that the bridge over the Sacramento River would fall. During the war years, Frank Didion was transferred from base to base, and the family moved with him. The transience made Joan something of an outsider, and she remained one even when the Didions finally settled again in Sacramento. If she was ill at ease with people, Joan at least found more congenial company in books. ""I tended to perceive the world in terms of things read about it,"" she says. ""I still do."" When she was 5, Joan wrote her first story: A tale of a woman who dreamed she was freezing to death in the Arctic, only to wake up and find herself in the scorching heat of the Sahara. By 15, she was learning to type and learning how sentences worked by copying over chapters from Ernest Hemingway and Joseph Conrad. Her own stories of that period displayed a somewhat less eclectic taste; they all had one theme-suicide. In some, the hero walked through the streets of San Francisco to jump off the Golden Gate Bridge; in others, he simply walked into the sea. One summer when she was in the eighth grade and her parents had a beach cottage, Joan determined to find out for herself how it would feel to walk into the ocean. After telling her parents she and her brother, Jimmy, were going to a square dance, she dropped Jimmy off at the Greyhound bus terminal, told him to wait for her and went on to the shore herself. Then, note pad in hand, she gingerly walked into the ocean. The night was dark, and she had no sooner waded in knee-deep than a wave hit her in the face. Sopping wet, her romantic notions of suicide considerably dampened, she made her way back to the terminal, retrieved her brother, and sneaked back into the house. At Berkeley, Didion majored in English literature, and after graduating in 1956 headed for New York. Her passport there was first prize in the Vogue magazine Prix de Paris writing competition, which she received for a piece on the San Francisco architect William Wilson Wurster. Her editor at Vogue, Allene Talmey, was a perfectionist who insisted on the right adjective, the ""shock"" verb, the well-turned caption. ""At first she wrote captions,"" recalls Talmey. ""I would have her write 300 to 400 words and then cut it back to 50. We wrote long and published short and by doing that Joan learned to write."" One of her first efforts: ""Opposite, above: All through the house, colour, verve, improvised treasures in happy but anomalous coexistence. Here, a Frank Stella, an Art Nouveau stained-glass panel, a Roy Lichtenstein. Not shown: A table covered with brilliant oilcloth, a Mexican find at fifteen cents a yard."" Joan went on to write stories on furniture, homes and personalities; the exercises honed her unfailing eye for detail and fine-turned her lean prose. Homesick for California, Didion began to make notes for a book set in the Sacramento Valley. The book was ""Run River,"" an earnest first novel about a failed marriage. By the end of the book, there are two suicides, a murder and an abortion; only Lily McClellan survives. Already, many of the obsessional themes of Didion's work are in evidence: a pervasive sense of emotional weariness that surfaces in passionate couplings and the rote acting out of expected roles; a yearning after control and order by those who see their lives falling apart; a fatalistic realization that every particular fate is the fruit born of a particular history. All of Didion's time in New York, though, was not spent over a typewriter. She liked parties. At 25 or so, she says, ""I decided it was pathological for a grown woman to be shy, and I began pushing myself to make a contribution. Instead of being shy, I became 'reticent.'"" She did not talk a great deal, but maintained a kind of Jamesian distance that insulated her from the rigors of cocktail patter and heightened her reportorial eye. For several years, Didion attended many of those parties in the company of another writer. After living together for several years, they broke up. ""I remember leaving [him]... one bad afternoon in New York, packing a suitcase and crying while he watched me,"" Didion wrote in a Life column. ""When I asked him finally how he could watch me, he told me that a great many things had happened to him during the 10 years before I knew him and nothing much touched him anymore. I remember saying that I never wanted to get the way he was, and he looked at me a long while before he answered. 'Nobody wants to,' he said. 'But you will.'"" A good friend over the years had been an ambitious young writer at Time magazine, John Gregory Dunne. The two frequently discussed their work with each other, and Dunne helped her correct the galleys to ""Run River."" In 1963 they got an apartment together, and a year later, they were married. ""I wonder how the marriage would have worked if we hadn't known each other so many years when we were really close friends,"" said Dunne once. ""People have a hard time believing this, but these is no professional competition between us. I think the reason is the six years of friendship when we were both starting off together."" Didion agrees: ""Writers are very boring to live with. If I weren't married to a writer, I couldn't be as self-absorbed as I am."" By the time they were married, New York had begun to grate on Didion's nerves-and working at a newsmagazine on Dunne's-and three months later they left for California. In 1966, they adopted a baby girl whom they named Quintana Roo after the Yucatan territory. Didion says she once believed ""that I could live outside history, that the currents of the time in which I lived did not touch or affect me."" Then, sometime in 1966, she says, she became ""paralyzed by the conviction that the world as I had understood it no longer existed. If I was to work again at all, it would be necessary for me to come to terms with disorder."" And disorder was rife in the 1960's; Los Angeles, a perfect vantage point from which to watch those years. Her chronicle of that period, ""Slouching Towards Bethlehem,"" was published in 1968. At the time Didion was acclaimed for ""Slouching,"" Dunne had yet to achieve the fame that ""True Confessions"" would later bring him. In the summer of 1968, suffering from a protracted case of writer's block, Dunne began driving the highways-sometimes to San Bernardino, sometimes to Reno, sometimes to Mexicali. One morning he told Didion he was going out to buy a loaf of bread. He did: 457 miles away at a Safeway in San Francisco. Finally, he moved to a residential motel just off the Strip in Las Vegas, and for 18 months lived there among hookers, card sharks and comedians. Didion bought him three sets of clean sheets and a wastepaper basket; she did not see the apartment until the day he headed home. After sharing a Saturday Evening Post column with her husband and writing another column for Life, Didion began her second novel. In 1970, ""Play It As It Lays"" was published and nominated for a National Book Award. Her editor on the book, Henry Robbins, remembers his first reaction: ""It was a brilliant book but cold, almost icy. A devastating book. When I finished it, I wanted to call her up and ask her if she was all right. I did see it as the experience of despair."" Arranged in 84 staccato-paced takes, the elliptical prose is pared down, perfectly clean. The setting is the desert; the cast, the careless hedonists of Hollywood; the emotional climate, bleak as the surroundings. Having experienced a bad affair, a worse marriage, the birth of a brain-damaged child and the abortion of another, Maria Wyeth suffers that exhaustion of the spirit born of disillusionment and emotional bankruptcy. And yet, she survives. It is Maria, at the end of the book, who can say, ""I know what 'nothing' means, and keep on playing. Why, BZ would say. Why not, I say."" ""Play It As It Lays"" grew out of a scene Didion once observed at the Sands Hotel in Las VegasL At midnight, a woman in a white gown walked across the casino floor to answer a phone. Didion began asking herself, ""Who is this Woman? What had occurred in her past that she should at this very moment be paged in the middle of Las Vegas?"" ""A Book of Common Prayer,"" published in 1977, similarly grew out of a single image. In the spring of 1973, Didion and Dunne had gone to South America to attend a film festival. While there, she contracted a case of paratyphoid and her weight dropped to 70 pounds. The entire trip took on a certain hallucinogenic quality, and an image of the Panama airport lodged in Didion's imagination. She became ""obsessed with a picture of the airport-its heat, the particular color of the stucco and especially the light which gets absorbed."" The central character in ""The Book of Common Prayer,"" Charlotte Douglas, is also de afuera, an outsider. Imagining she can escape the past, she come to the imaginary country of Boca Grande, where she is shot in a revolution-a casualty of her own romanticism. A technically difficult novel, the book received mixed reviews. As a number of critics pointed out, the device of a dispassionate, uninvolved narrator results in an oblique narrative that fails to win our complete sympathy for Charlotte's plight. Given the current visibility of the women's movement, there are those who see Didion's fiction as an example of that nebulous genre-""women's novels."" The women in her novels, after all, are haunted by the issues of mothers and daughters, blood and babies. Then, too, they are usually victims of men who have in some way failed them. The men in the novels-Ryder Channing in ""Run River,"" Ivan Costello in ""Play It As It Lays,"" and Warren Bogart in ""A Book of Common Prayer""-are remarkably similar. All are brash, irreverent skeptics capable of almost cruel beligerence and possessed of sexual charm that renders the women powerless. They are corrupters of innocence, destroyers of idealism. The women, for their part, are adept at coping with the immediate, the practical, but have trouble connecting the past with the future. Like Charlotte in ""A Book of Common Prayer,"" each believes she can remain ""a tourist, a traveler with good will and good credentials and no memory."" Didion, however, maintains that her female characters ""don't really have specifically women's problems; they have rather more general problems."" Indeed, Didion is skeptical of the women's movement. As she writes in ""The White Album"": ""To those of us who remain committed mainly to the exploration of moral distinctions and ambiguities, the feminist analysis... [denies] one's actual apprehension of what it is like to be a woman, the irreconcilable difference of it-that sense of living one's deepest life underwater, that dark involvement with blood and birth and death."" Didion occasionally forces herself to do reporting (which she dislikes) to replenish her image bank, to gather new material for her novels. And in both ""Play It As It Lays"" and ""A Book of Common Prayer,"" the reporter's eye is very much in evidence, grounding the melodramatics of the plot in a precision of detail. Didion has carefully observed the manners and mores of the moneyed set that frequents Los Angeles and expertly records those observations with a mordant wit. ""Le island. Le weekend. Les monkey-gland injections,"" babbles a silly socialite in ""A Book of Common Prayer."" Asked about her husband at a cocktail party, Charlotte replies: ""He runs guns. I wish they had caviar."" Ma Maison is one of those peculiarly Hollywood phenomena. A modest wooden structure on Melrose Avenue that resembles a country hamburger stand, it is probably the most celebrated celebrity hangout since Romanoff's in the days of the Rat Pack. On this particular Wednesday, George Cukor is there, as are Jackie Bisset, Dustin Hoffman and the Jack Lemmons. There are nods and greetings all around as the Dunnes and Carl Bernstein walk in for lunch. ""The same old faces,"" says Bernstein looking around. ""This place never changes.""  ""No,"" says Didion. ""Time stands still here."" The Dunnes and Bernstein talk about writing as writers will: how many pages a day constitutes a good day's work; where the ideal place to write would be. Dunne, who, as his friend Calvin Trillin puts it, is a ""creative gossip,"" regales the others with stories, which Didion occasionally embroiders. The Dunne's work on screenplays has made them regulars on the local dinner party-screening circuit, and they are frequently mentioned in The Hollywood Reporter's column ""The Great Life"" along with the likes of Bianca Jagger, Paul Morrissey and Linda Ronstadt. Collaborators on all their screenplays, the Dunnes regard writing for the movies not so much a creative effort but as a respite from the solitary rigors of fiction and reportage, and they have worked on a dozen films, including dramatizations of ""Play It As It Lays,"" ""The Panic in Needle Park"" and ""A Star Is Born."" They are currently finishing a screenplay of Dunne's best-selling novel ""True Confessions."" That project completed, Didion will go back to work on her next novel, ""Angel Visits."" The title, she explains, comes from a Victorian expression meaning ""pleasant visits of short duration."" Although the book started off as an extended dinner party in which the lives of three generations of a family are revealed, Didion says that the narrative of the book continues to change as she works on it. When she is in the midst of a book, Didion works at the typewriter in her office from 11 in the morning until 4 or 5 in the afternoon. Before cooking dinner (and she is an excellent cook), she sits down with a drink and her day's work, penciling in sentences, crossing out others. ""Order and control are terribly important to me,"" says Didion as she sits on a couch in her den, fingering a tiny green pillbox. ""I would love to just have control over my own body-to stop the pain, to stop my hand from shaking. If I were 5 feet 10 and had a clear gaze and a good strong frame, I would not have such a maniacal desire for control because I would have it."" If control is elusive, order at least is provided by a multitude of domestic tasks Didion enjoys: making her own pastry; polishing the silver; taking her orchids to the greenhouse for repotting; preparing dinner parties; helping Q. with her vocabulary. In Didion's novels, the women, too, practice little rituals-improvised regimens relied upon in lieu of any greater order. Even while she is wildly driving the highways, Maria ""tried always to let the [gas station] attendant notice her putting the [Coke] bottle in the rack, a show of thoughtful responsibility."" There is in such gestures a means of warding off what Didion has called ""the unspeakable peril of the everyday."" A means of keeping man's frail civilization roadmarked from the wilderness (the coyotes by the interstate, the snakes in the playpen; the fires and winds of California) that for Didion is always lurking just outside the house.

Abortion Measure Going to the Assembly,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/10/archives/new-jersey-weekly-abortion-measure-going-to-the-assembly.html,"TRENTON WITH the primary elections now history and the general election six months away, the State Assembly will turn tomorrow to a bill that has generated more disputes among women's organizations than any other. It is a proposal to rewrite the abortion laws. Basically, the measure provides that: q lt is the state's position that the fetus is a human being from the moment of conception. q Physicians must tell women of the psychological and physical problems that may arise because of an abortion. q Women must sign statements acknowledging the above and then wait 48 hours before undergoing an abortion. q Physicians must inform the parents or guardians of a girl under 18 years of age seeking an abortion qAll abortions after the 12th week must be performed in hospitals. The bill was introduced by Asseniblyman Thomas J. Deverin of Carteret, a Democrat being mentioned as possibly the next Speaker. It was scheduled for a vote last month, but the vote was delayed until after last Tuesday's primaries. Although all sections of the measure have generated controversy, the move to require that abortions after the 12th week be performed in hospitals is likely to be the most significant. Recently, the state's Board of Medical Examiners adopted regulations allowing abortions through the 16th week of pregnancy to be performed at the six licensed abortion clinics in New Jersey. A spokesman for the board, Joan D. Gelber, said that 7,000 pregnancies in the 12th to 17th week were aborted in the state annually. In clinics, the cost of such abortions is about $200; in hospitals, it ranges up to $1,000. About 85 percent of the 45,000 to 50,000 abortions done in New Jersey each year are performed in the first three months of pregnancy, almost all of them in the offices of physicians. Despite the strong opposition of many women's groups to any changes in abortion procedures, the Deverin bill is expected to pass. Most legislators feel that a majority of New Jerseyans oppose easy abortions. Much of the opposition has been ex pressed privately to legislators by family planning experts. Approval of the measure, they contend, could mean that many young unmarried women would have babies they could not care for. The New Jersey Family Planning News, published by an association of family planners, called the Deverin proposal “unacceptably biased and chilling.” Opposition to the measure from the National Organization for Women has prompted counterattacks from two groups, “WE""(Women Exploited) and “New Jersey Majority Women.” Members of the latter organization threatened to demonstrate at the State House unless the Deverin bill was taken up and passed. Leaders of both “WE” and “New Jersey Majority Women” said that the National Organization for Women did not reflect the views of women. According to Peggi Bardes of “WE,” that organization consists of about 2,500 women who have had abortions, or a “disturbing personal experience with abortion,” and who believe that all women should know of the possible medical and psychological consequences. The American Civil Liberties, in opposing the Deverin bill, asserted that the provisions requiring women to sign consent forms that they understood the consequences of abortions were “almost certainly unconsitutional.” “The real intent,” said David Hochner, legislative director of the New Jersey A.C.L.U., “is to scare women into bearing children and to place doctors in a 'straitjacket.’ ” The Deverin bill will not affect the current status of Medicaid abortions. New Jersey has a law prohibiting the use of tax funds to pay for any abortions, but the courts have not yet ruled on its constitutionality. State courts have held that tax money can be used to pay for abortions for poor women if their physicians find that the abortion is necessary to protect the woman's health or mental wellbeing. According to Anne Burns, a spokesman for the state's Department of Human Services, tax money is being used to pay for about 25 such abortions a month. Before passsage of the law, tax money paid for about 10,500 abortions a year. MARTIN WALDRON"
A Frugal Session Ends,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/10/archives/connecticut-weekly-a-frugal-session-ends-a-frugal-session-ends-in.html,"HARTFORD AFIER six unusually calm months, the General Assembly wound up its 1979 session last Wednesday with a record that seems responsive to the current mood of the voters as well as to the priorities of the Governor. Legislators heard the demands for frugal spending and acted accordingly. Because money was too scarce this year to plan any new programs, the legislators occupied most of their time with a number of extremely emotional issues, few of which they were able to permanently resolve. Among the issues they tackled were capital punishment, abortion, discrimination against homosexuals, mandatory work programs for welfare recipients, a moratorium on new nuclear power plants and the drinking age for teenagers. The two major accomplishments of this session were passage of the budget and of a new and more equitable system for financing public schools. After that, according to Senator Richard F. Schneller, a Democrat of Essex, “it was all cosmetics.” On this there Is wide agreement. Squeezed in among the rhetoric, the Legislature enacted a few other major bills, inchiding measures on juvenile justice, speeding drivers, smoking in restaurants, gambling regulation and coastal land management. In all, the legislators considered nearly 5,000 bills, debating quite a few late into the night with tempers flaring. But in the end, they did what they were forced to do and not much more. The State Supreme Court had ordered the Legislature to come up with a plan to equalize educational opportunities for the state's children regardless of the wealth of their communities. The Legislature responded with a program that will cost $39 million in new money in the fiscal year beginning July land $190 million over five years. The new education money was the only substantive increase in expenditures approved by the General Assembly. When the next year's state budget was finally adopted, it called for only a 5.5 percent increase in total spending, far below the expected rate of inflation. The complicated business of arriving at new program for public schools overshadowed all other matters this year. Representative Dorothy C. Goodwin, Democrat of Mansfield, the co‐chairman of the Education Committee and a former economics professor, skillfully led her colleagues through the maze of calculations to eventual passage of the measure. There is still some rumbling, mainly from cities, about challenging the school‐aid package in court again, but after the Legislature finally gave its approval for the plan in April, the 187 Senators and Representatives knew they had cleared a major hurdle. The last two months of the session were gentle jog to the finish line on June 6, the constitutionally mandated end of the session. Unlike other years, when the Legislature crammed much of its major work into the last few days of the session, this year the House and Senate worked at so leisurely pace after they dispensed with the budget and education packages that the House actually finished its work early. The House did not meet last Tuesday and came in on Wednesday in time for a few quick votes and the closing ceremonies. Shortly after voting, the education package, the Legislature easily adopted an aust ere $2.4 billion budget for fiscal 1980 that includes a small increase, 5 percent, in welfare benefits and minor cuts in many programs. Neither the Governor nor the Legislature approved any new taxes, and although the Governor asked for a small tax cut for business equipment, the Legislature rejected the idea of any kind of reduction. The budget sets aside only $28 million for a pay increase for 40,000 unionized state em” ployees, whose contract expires June 30. If the new settlement includes a raise of more than 6.1 percent, “we have a problem,” said Representative Gardner Wright, co‐chairman of the Appropriations Committee. The Legislature will return to Hartford for a special session, probably in the second or third week of July, to accept or override bills vetoed by the Governor. Depending on when the state employees reach their new contract, the Legislature may deal with it during the veto session or may meet in another special session later this summer. Because the Senate prides itself on being much more orderly than its sister chamber on the floor below, the speedy finish of House business this year greatly pleased the new House Speaker, Ernest N. Abate, a Stamford Democrat. One of the surprises of the year was the strength of the conservatives. After the November elections, when Democrats gained seats in both the House and the Senate, the popular prediction was for a more liberal Senate and House. But, said the leading liberal of the General Assembly, Representative Irving Stolberg, a Democrat of New Haven, “This was not the year for liberals, or conservatives either. For the most part it was a year of treading water.” Rather than listing various bills that were enacted this session as a measure of victory, both liberals and conservatives begin by adding up the measures they say that they have defeated. The liberals are pleased at the defeat of all the numerous attempts to stop or restrict abortions. They are pleased with the defeat, after days of sometimes emotional debate, of the “workfare” bill, a largely symbolic measure that would have forced the small number of people receiving welfare payments from the state into work programs set up by the citk Liberals were also pleased with the defeat of a capital punishment measure that would have added arson and mass murder to the current list of offenses punishable by death in the electric chair. No one is now on death row in Connecticut. Even so, there are laws currently on the books that allow capital punishment in a limited number of situations, such as the murder of a policeman, conviction of murder for second time, and the murder of a kidnapped person. The debate on capital punishment became so heated and confusing that at one point many legislators did not know what they had voted on. The capital punishment provision had been attached to a bill stiffening the laws for prosecution and punishment of arson. First the House rejected the idea of capital punishment for arson, but then passed what many members thought was a provision for capital punishment for mass murder. After much confusion — at one point a few legislators even thought they had accidentally repealed all capital punishment — there now seems to be general agreement that the bill sent to the Governor has absolutely nothing to do with capital punishment. Conservatives also counted negatives as positives this year by noting that a bill to ban discrimination against homosexuals lost, and a bill that would have forced corporations to give advance warning before laying off employees was drastically watered down and eventually killed. Kenneth Decko, lobbyist for the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, called this a “positive year.” He started with the observation that proposals to alter rating structures by utilities to the advantage of homeowners and disadvantage of business were defeated, as was a proposal to shift the tax burden to business. The big gain for business this year was passage of the product liability bill, which limits the circumstances under which consumers can sue manufacturers for faulty products. A similar bill was enacted in the last session, but the Governor had some technical problems with it that were worked out thic year. Businessmen say they ‘need thi law to protect them from the skyrocketing cost of liability insurance. Among the other measures passed by the Legislature was a bill requiring speeders to appear in court and pay higher fines. After becoming effective on Oct. I, the bill would also revoke a driver's license if he received four speeding tickets in two years, far more demanding rules than currently exist. As before, the speed limit continues to be 55 miles an hour on major roads. But under the new bill, fines can be imposed up to $100 and a violator no longer has the option of mailing payment for his fine. On juvenile justice, the Legislature passed a bill that would require youths over the age of 14 be tried in adult court the second time they are convicted of a major crime, such as murder or rape. The major environmental measure of the year was the adoption of the Coastal Area Management bill, which is designed to protect the coast from environmental damage, reduce pollution and develop the shoreline's recreational potential. The “home rule” diehards won some concessions on the bill this year and eventually it passed after great debate. With two exceptions, the Governor got everything she asked for from the Legislature this year, including a bill calling for drastic reorganization of the way the state's $72 million‐a‐year gambling industry is regulated. Replacing the current nine‐member Special Revenue Commission, is a “gambling czar” and a five‐member Policy Board for the Department of Special Revenue. The reorganization was prompted in large part by critics contending that the old commission lacked the expertise to handle the troubled gambling industry. Currently there are two grand juries investigating allegations of wrongdoing in the jai‐alai games and the lottery. Governor Grasso chose the former head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Connecticut, John Devine, as the new “gambling czar.” Nominated to serve on the new Policy Board were Emily Alice Stanley Wilson, a retired New Haven housing official; Herbert P. Schoen, chairman of the Hartford Insurance Group; Thomas R. Barrett, a retired executive of The Hartford Courant, and two members of the old commission, James G. Kellis, an executive with the Sikorsky division of the United Technologies Corporation, and Walter P. Stecko, a retired police lieutenant. The two proposals the Governor failed to gain legislative approval for were her nomination of Eva Hudak to the State Board of Education and replacement of the present state convention system by a direct primary process that would turn the nominating process over to the party voters. Amid many controversial issues, the rumpus over the Hudak nomination perhaps won first prize for hottest tempers. Politics, religion and personalities all contributed to weeks of fussing n. the nomination, and after a steamy nine‐hour confirmation hearing, the Senate decided, for the first time in more than 30 years, to reject a gubernatorial nomination. The only major bill the Governor was asked to accept against her wishes called for a one‐year delay in implementing the new law requiring annual emissions tests for all state automobiles. The law, passed last year, was supposed to go into effect next January. Advocates of the delay said, however, that more time was needed to find an independent contractor to do the inspections. Both houses voted the bill by wide margins. Therefore it appears that the Governor may have difficulty sustaining the veto during the special session in July. The Governor campaigned last year on the need for a constitutional amendment to limit state spending and she went through the motions of submitting such a proposal to the Legislature. Having recognized strong opposition to the measure from House and Senate leaders who thought it was unnecessary, the Governor never pushed the issue very hard and it died quickly. The leaders are generally against any alterations of the Constitution, aria despite sentiment elsewhere for meas. ures similar to California's Proposition 13, which ordered a cut in state spending, the Legislature rejected a resolation calling for a Federal constitutional convention to force C.3 Federal Gov., eminent to balance its budget. The Legislature made exceptions, however, on amendments to the State and Federal Constitutions on bond issues and the D.C. Amendment. Members joined other states in voting to give the District of Columbia ftal representation in Congress. And, although the Governor says it is already her policy, the Legislature voted to change the State Constitution to prohibit the issuance of bonds for current expenditures. One of the most talked‐about but least substantive bills passed by the Assembly, was the moratorium on con*ruction of new nuclear power plants in the state. No one, not even the utility companies, has suggested building any more nuclear plants. Moreover the bill Ignored the question of whether construction should be halted on the state's forth nuclear power plant, Millstone III in Waterford. • An attempt to raise the drinking age in the state also followed the route of symbolism to final passage. Everyone agreed that teenage drinking is a growing problem in the state and country, and some wanted to solve the problem by raising the drinking age from 18 to 21. Forces arguing that changing the age limit was only a cosmetic solution suceeded in diluting the bill. What passed was a bill allowing 18year olds to drink in bars and restuants, but teenagers would have to be 19 before they could make liquor purchases in package stores. The compromise was designed to stop high‐school students from bring liquor into the schools for consumption by even younger children. The Governor vetoed the bill, arguing that the split age was unconstitutional. Having watched the General Assembly's deliberations for six months, Yorke Allen Jr, a freshman Republican from New Canaan who has emerged as a rare orator in the House, concluded that the place is a “pressure cooker.” The retired Ford Foundation executive said he had never worked harder in his life. “The voters are frightened of the Legislature which they see as a vast bill factory turning out laws that the legislators don't know as much about as they should,” he said. “The voters are right.” The New York Times"
JOAN DIDION: STAKING OUT CALIFORNIA,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/10/archives/joan-didion-staking-out-california.html,"In her new book, “The White Album,” Joan Didion writes: “Kilimanjaro belongs to Ernest Hemingway. Oxford, Mississippi, belongs to William Faulkner ... a great deal of Honolulu has always belonged for me to James Jones. . . . A place belongs for‐ ever to whoever claims it hardest, remembers it most obsessively, wrenches it from itself, shapes it, renders it, loves it so radically that he remakes it in his image.” California belongs to Joan Didion. Not the California where everyone wears aviator sunglasses, owns Jacuzzi and buys his clothes on Rodeo Drive. But California in the sense of the West. The old West where Manifest Destiny was an almost palpable notion that was somehow tied to the land and the climate and one's own family ‐ an unspoken belief that was passed down to children in stories and sayings. Joan Didion's California is a place defined not so much by what her unwavering eye observes, but by what her memory cannot let go. Although her essays and novels are set amid the effluvia of a new golden state peopled by bored socialites, lost flower children and unsentimental engineers, all is measured against the memory of the old California. And in telling what has happened to California in the past few decades, Didion finds a metaphor for some larger, insidious process at work in American society. The theatrics of James Pike, Episcopal Bishop of California, become a parable of the American penchant for discarding history and starting tabula rasa; the plight of a San Bernardino woman accused of murdering her husband, a lesson in The California Joan Didion lives in, though, is very much the latter‐day California. Brentwood Park is one of those sedate residential sections of Los Angeles; her street, one that is lined with Tudor‐style homes, white Colonials and pillared mansions. Didion is sitting in the den. The rooms of her house possess all the soothing order and elegance of a Vogue photo spread: sofas covered in floral chintz, lavender love seats the exact color of the potted orchids on the mantelpiece, porcelain elephant end tables, and dozens of framed pictures of family and friends. Still, this is the kind of day that can give Joan Didion a migraine. In the first place, there is car trouble: Her husband's new pearl gray Jaguar was dented this morning by a neighbor pulling out of her driveway, and her own 1969 yellow Corvette Sting Ray —a Corvette exactly like the one Maria drove in “Play It As It Lays” — needs a new transmission. Then there are the rats. “The exterminator took one look at the backyard and said we were sure to have rats in the avocado tree,” she says. “That's when I started thinking about bubonic plague.” Today, though, it isn't so much the rats or the cars that are bothering Didion. It's the dining room curtains: instead of gathering the new curtains, the decorator has pleated them. The perfect geometric regularity of those folds triggers migraines, she thinks. She is making a new set of curtains herself. Wearing a faded blue sweatshirt over brown corduroy levis, Didion at 44 strikes anyone who sees her for the first time as the embodiment of the women in her own novels: like Lily McClellan in “Run River,” she is “strikingly frail” (Didion is 5 feet 2, and weighs 95 pounds); like Maria in “Play It As It Lays,” she used to chain‐smoke and wear chiffon scarves over her red hair; and like Charlotte in “A Book of Comman Prayer,” she possesses “an extreme and volatile thinness ... she was a woman. . . with a body that masqueraded as that of a young girl.” There is a certain sadness in the face that indicates a susceptibility to what she calls “early morning dread""; even indoors, she wears oversized sun glasses to protect her light‐sensitive eyes. An almost Southern softness lingers in her voice — she identifies it as an Okie accent picked up in Sacramento high schools — and bright laughter punctuates her unfinished sentences. It is a voice so soft, so tentative at times, that one frequently has to strain to hear her. The “Didion woman” has by now become a recognizable literary figure. Women who have misunderstood the promises of the past, they are habitues of a clearly personal wasteland, wandering along highways or through countries in an effort to blot out the pain of consciousness. They lose their men to suicide, divorce and cancer; their children to abortion, bad genes and history. They are outsiders, but they are also survivors, fatalists who keep on playing the game regardless of the odds. In her highly praised collection of essays, “Slouching Towards Bethlehem,” Didion meticulously portrayed herself as one also well acquainted with the edge. She wrote of “bad nerves,” of drinking “gin and hot water to blunt the pain and . . . Dexedrine to blunt the gin.” Something of a sequel to that first anthology, “The White Album,” which will be published June 17 by Simon & Schuster, is a collection of her best work from Life, Esquire, The Saturday Evening Post, The New York Times and The New York Review of Books. Novelist and poet James Dickey has called Didion “the finest woman prose stylist writing in English today.” And she has created, in her books, one of the most devastating and distinctive portraits of modern America to be found in fiction or nonfiction — a portrait of America where “disorder was its own point.” A gifted reporter with an eye for the telling detail — the frayed hem, the shaking hand — she is also a prescient witness, finding in her own experiences parallels of the times. The voice is always precise, the tone unsentimental, the view unabashedly subjective. She takes things personally. The title of the new book comes, of course, from the Beatles’ “White Album,” a record Didion found ominous and disturbing, an album inextricably connected to the Manson murders and the dissonance of the 60's. Didion's own “White Album” contains a number of images from the Manson years: Linda Kasabian awaiting trial in a dress Didion bought for her at I. Magnin; Huey Newton lecturing the press on the “American capitalisticmaterialistic system""; students at San Francisco State College breaking the tedium of the academic calendar with a campus revolt. “The White Album,” though, is not solely concerned with the 60's. Or, for that matter, with Didion's alienation. Whereas Yeats's poem “The Second Coming” (""Things fall apart; the center cannot hold ..."") served as a perfect epigraph for “Slouching Towards Bethlehem,” no such image exists to sum up “The White Album.” This second volume of essays is not so absolute in its tragic vision of the world, not so unquestioningly bleak about history. As Didion herself puts it, “'The White Album’ is more tentative. I don't have as many answers as I did when I wrote 'slouching.'” “The White Album” includes a brilliant essay on Hollywood as “the last extant stable society”; a tribute to Georgia O'Keeffe, and a charming portrait of one Amado Vazquez, a Mexican gardener who raises orchids in Malibu. The collection, in fact, demonstrates Didion's range as an essayist, her ability not only to portray the extraordinary and apocalyptic, but also to appreciate the ordinary. “I am alienated,” explains Didion, “I would say I am a victim. But you don't live every day of your life walking around talking about how alienated you are — you'd start sounding like Woody Allen's ‘Interiors.'” Both Didion and her husband, John Gregory Dunne, the author of “Vegas,” “True Confessions” and “Quintana & Friends,” have made their lives the subject of their reportage. Their thoughts on divorce, their adoption of their daughter, Quintana, and their nervous breakdowns have all been meticulously chronicled in print. The candor frequently stuns. “[In person] Joan gives everyone the impression of being very private,” observes Ralph Graves, now editorial director of Time Inc. who was editor of Life magazine when Didion wrote her column. “Then she'll turn around and write this inside‐of‐the‐stomach stuff that you'd think you'd need to know her five years to find out. This mousy, thin, quiet woman tells you as much about herself as Mailer.” For Didion, though, it is merely part of the contract a writer makes with the reader: as she once told her husband, “If you want to write about yourself, you have to give them something.” Why has she chosen this relentless self‐scrutiny? One suspects that writing holds for her a kind of talismanic power — the process of putting her life on paper somehow helps to exorcise private demons. Writing, after all, is means of creating a momentary stay against confusion, of making order out of disorder, understanding out of fear. In her newest book, Didion does not shirk from exposing herself. “You are getting a woman who somewhere along the line misplaced whatever slight faith she ever had in the social contract, in the meliorative principle ... I have felt myself a sleepwalker.., alert only to the stuff of bad dreams, the children burning in the locked car in the supermarket parking lot ... I have trouble maintaining the basic notion that keeping promises matters in a world where everything I was taught seems beside the point.” She tells us how she went blind for six weeks from a condition diagnosed as multiple sclerosis (the disease has been in remission for the past seven years), and how, in the summer of 1968, she checked into the psychiatric clinic at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica. She even tells us the doctor's diagnosis: “Patient's thematic productions emphasize her fundamentally pessimistic, fatalistic and depressive view of the world around her....” Yet this familiar Didion persona masks a writer whose own life is wealth of contradictions. She is a Westerner who mourns the passing of the frontier ethic, but lives in Los Angeles because the city amuses her. She is romantic who believes “that salvation [lies] in promises made and somehow kept outside the range of normal social experience,” but delights in practical, domestic routines. She is an introvert who says she has always been an outsider, but parties with the biggest names in Hollywood. She is a writer who has dwelled on the atomization of modern society, but maintains what she describes as a “boring, bourgeois” Didion's friends jokingly refer to her as the “Kafka of Brentwood Park,” which amuses her husband no end. “Joan's really a rather cheerful person who drives a bright yellow Corvette,” says Dunne. “in person, she doesn't have a dark view of life. She just doesn't expect a lot from it or from people.” Dunne, a large, gregarious man, gives the appearance of managing Didion's life. He tends to do most of the talking, frequently answering questions directed at Didion; he always answers the phones and screens the calls. But, according to their friends, it is Didion who handles all their finances and Didion who smooths over situations created by Dunne's volatile temper. “John does not play Leonard Woolf to her Virginia,” notes writer Josh Greenfeld, one of the Dunnes’ best friends in Los Angeles. “She's more John's Leonard Woolf. John may seem strident and tough, but what you see in John you get in Joan. She is every bit as tough as he is.” Another friend describes Didion as “fragile,” as in the phrase, “a fragile, little stainless‐steel machine.” Didion, too, thinks of herself as an optimist. Hers is an optimism somewhat akin to F. Scott Fitzgerald's definition of a first‐rate intelligence: “the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function.” To believe that nothing matters and yet to believe more strongly that it is worth making a record of experience anyway. Her awareness of “the edge” is, in part, a literary idea that derives from what seized her imagination as a child. The people she read about in the fiction of Conrad, James and Faulkner convinced a young Didion that “salvation lay in extreme and doomed commitments,” and later provided models for the characters in her own novels. “I have a theatrical temperament,” explains Didion. “I'm not interested in the middle road — maybe because everyone's on it. Rationality, reason ableness bewilder me. I think it comes out of being a ‘daughter of the Golden West.’ A lot of the stories I was brought up on had to do with extreme actions —leaving everything behind, crossing the trackless wastes, and in those stories the people who stayed behind and had their settled ways — those people were not the people who got the prize. The prize was California.” We are on a flight from Los Angeles to Sacramento, where Didion's parents live. As the plane circles over the coast toward the valley, Didion turns to look out the window. “It kills me when people talk about California hedonism,” she says deliberately. “Anybody who talks about California hedonism has never spent a Christmas in Sacramento.” Didion's family— five generations on her mother's side — come from Sacramento. Although it is the state capital, it remains a valley town where the summers are hot and plagued by drought, and where the winters are cold and menaced by flood. The land here is flat, the rivers and fields stretching clean to the horizon. It is, in short, a landscape of extremes. In writing of the Sacramento of her childhood, Didion frequently uses the word “Eden,” and to the early settlers it probably was — or at least a reasonable facsimile of Paradise. The confluence of the muddy, silt‐rich Sacramento and the swiftly flowing American made the region a fertile garden. It is only within the past three decades that the cultivated fields have given way to tract housing, subdivisions and aerospace factories; the dusty roads along the levee to eight‐lane freeways. Even as we drive through town, Didion peruses a map provided by the rent‐a‐car company. She is unaccustomed to finding her way home via the new highways, for the Sacramento she knows so well is a town of the past. “All that is constant about the California of my childhood is the rate at which it disappears,” she wrote in “Slouching Towards Bethlehem.” “California is a place in which a boom mentality and a sense of Chekhovian loss meet in uneasy suspension.” The road leading to the Didions’ Tudor house once ran through hop fields; today it is flanked by a thriving industrial park. Inside, their living room is a comfortable assemblage of mementos and assorted knickknacks collected by Eduene Jerrett Didion at local craft fairs. A small forthright woman, she met John Dunne for the first time at her daughter's wedding and told him: “You know those little old ladies in tennis shoes you've heard about? Well, I'm one of them.” Her husband is a quiet, shy man. A former Army Air Corps officer who later served on the Sacramento draft board, Frank Didion now dabbles in real estate. Joan's bedroom is still the faded Tony Costo She is “an introvert who says she has atways been an outsider, but she parties with the biggest names in Hollywood.” carnation pink she painted it when she was a freshman at Berkeley, but bougainvillea and ivy have overgrown the windows, giving the chamber a dark, cavelike effect. Didion returned to this room to finish each of her five books. She wrote the last 150 pages of “A Book of Common Prayer” here in 19 days. After all, there are no distractions in Sacramento: the phones are answered, the meals are prepared, and her parents leave her alone to work. On a dressing table here, as in her study back in Brentwood, there is a small framed photograph of the Sierras near Donner Pass. The tale of the Donner Party haunts Didion. Traveling from Illinois to California in 1896, the DonnerReed party was forced by a sudden blizzard to encamp in the Sierras. Faced with starvation, they ate their own dead. Of the 87 who embarked, 40 survived. Joan's greatgreat ‐ great ‐ grandmother, Nancy Hardin Cornwall, was a member of the original Donner party, but she had left the ill‐fated group at Humboldt Sink in Nevada to cut north through Oregon. Nancy Hardin Cornwall's own forebears lived on the frontier, moving from the Carolinas to Georgia to Arkansas to Missouri with the nation's westward migration, and Didion clings to that heritage. “I used to be strongly convinced that the closing of the frontiers was the central event, the turning point in American history,” she says. “I am not flatly convinced of that anymore, but I myself ‘ feel better the farther west I am.” The frontier legacy, she feels, has made her different, has ingrained in her a kind of hard‐boiled individualism, an “ineptness at tolerating the complexities of postindustrial life.” And it has made her something of a libertarian, wary of governmental panaceas and distrustful of utopian promises. Like her parents, Didion voted for Goldwater in 1964. Since then, she has voted only twice. “I never had faith that the answers to human problems lay in anything that could be called political,” she explained once. “I thought the answers, if there were answers, lay someplace in man's soul.” Joan was a fearful child —scared of ski lifts, of rattle‐ snakes in the river, even of comic books filled as they were with violence and monsters. She worried that the funicular at Royal Gorge would crash, that the bridge over the Sacramento River would fall. During the war years, Frank Didion was transferred from base to base, and the family moved with him. The transience made Joan something of an outsider, and she remained one even when the Didions finally settled again in Sacramento. If she was ill at ease with people, Joan at least found more congenial company in books. “I tended to perceive the world in terms of things read about it,” she says. “I still do.” When she was 5, Joan wrote her first story: A tale of a woman who dreamed she was freezing to death in the Arctic, only to wake up and find herself in the scorching heat of the Sahara. By 15, she was learning to type and learning Flow sentences worked by copying over chapters from Ernest Hemingway and Joseph Conrad. Her own stories of that period displayed a somewhat less eclectic taste; they all had one theme — suicide. In some, the hero walked through the streets of San Francisco to jump off the Golden Gate Bridge; in others, he simply walked into the sea. One summer when she was in the eighth grade and her parents had a beach cottage, Joan determined to find out for herself how it would feel to walk into the ocean. After telling her parents she and her brother, Jimmy, were going to a square dance, she dropped Jimmy off at the Greyhound bus terminal, told him to wait for her and went on to the shore herself. Then, note pad in hand, she gingerly walked into the ocean. The night was dark, and she had no sooner waded in knee‐deep than a wave hit her in the face. Sopping wet, her romantic notions of suicide considerably dampened, she made her way back to the terminal, retrieved her brother, and sneaked back into the house. At Berkeley, Didion majored in English literature, and after graduating in 1956 headed for New York. Her passport there was first prize in the Vogue magazine Prix de Paris writing competition, which she received for a piece on the San Francisco architect William Wilson Wurster. Her editor at Vogue, Allene Talmey, was a perfectionist who insisted on the right adjective, the “shock” verb, the well‐turned caption. “At first she wrote captions,” recalls Talmey. “I would have her write 300 to 400 words and then cut it back to 50. We wrote long and published short and by doing that Joan learned to write.” One of her first efforts: “Opposite, above: All through the house, colour, verve, improvised treasures in happy but anomalous coexistence. Here, a Frank Stella, an Art Nouveau stained‐glass panel, a Roy Lichtenstein. Not shown: A table covered with brilliant oilcloth, a Mexican find at fifteen cents a yard.” Joan went on to write stories on furniture, homes and personalities; the exercises honed her unfailing eye for detail and fine‐tuned her lean prose. Homesick for California, Didion began to make notes for a book set in the Sacramento Valley. The book was “Run River,” an earnest first novel about a failed marriage. By the end of the book, there are two suicides, a murder and an abortion; only Lily McClellan survives. Already, many of the obsessional themes of Didion's work are in evidence: a pervasive sense of emotional weariness that surfaces in passionless couplings and the rote acting out of expected roles; a yearning after control and order by those who see their lives falling apart; a fatalistic realization that every particular fate is the fruit born of a particular history, All of Didion's time in New York, though, was not spent over a typewriter. She liked parties. At 25 or so, she says, “I decided it was pathological for a grown woman to be shy, and I began pushing myself to make a contribution. Instead of being shy, I became ‘reticent.'” She did not talk a great deal, but maintained a kind of Jamesian distance that insulated her from the rigors of cocktail patter and heightened her reportorial eye. For several years, Didion attended many of those parties in the company of another writer. After living together for several years, they broke up. “I remember leaving [him] ... one bad afternoon in New York, packing a suitcase and crying while he watched me,” Didion wrote in a Life column. “When I asked him finally how he could watch me, he told me that a great many things had happened to him during the 10 years before I knew him and nothing much touched him anymore. I remember saying that I never wanted to get the way he was, and he looked at me a long while before he answered. ‘Nobody wants to,’ he said. ‘But you will'” A good friend over the years had been an ambitious young writer at Time magazine, John Gregory Dunne. The two frequently discussed their work with each other, and Dunne helped her correct the galleys to “Run River.” In 1963 they got an apartment together, and a year later, they were married. “I wonder how the marriage would have worked if we hadn't known each other so many years when we were really close friends,” said Dunne once. “People have a hard time believing this, but there is no professional competition between us. I think the reason is the six years of friendship when we were both starting off together.” Didion agrees: “Writers are very boring to live with. If I weren't married to a writer, I couldn't be as self‐absorbed as By the time they were married, New York had begun to grate on Didion's nerves —and working at a newsmagazine on Dunne's — and three months later they left for California. In 1966, they adopted a baby girl whom they named Quintana Roo after the Yucatan territory. Didion says she once believed “that I could live outside history, that the currents of the time in which I lived did not touch or affect me.” Then, sometime in 1966, she says, she became “paralyzed by the conviction that the world as I had understood it no longer existed. If I was to work again at all, it would be necessary for me to come to terms with disorder.” And disorder was rife in the 60's; Los Angeles, a perfect vantage point from which to watch those years. Her chronicle of that period, “Slouching Towards Bethlehem,” was published in 1968. At the time Didion was acclaimed for “Slouching,” Dunne had yet to achieve the fame that “True Confessions” would later bring him. In the summer of 1968, suffering from a protracted case of writer's block, Dunne began driving the highways — sometimes to San Bernardino, sometimes to Reno, sometimes to Mexicali. One morning he told Didion he was going out to buy a loaf of bread. He did: 457 miles away at a Safeway in San Francisco. Finally, he moved to a residential motel just off the Strip in Las Vegas, and for 18 months lived there among hookers, card sharks and comedians. Didion bought him three sets of clean sheets and a wastepaper basket; she did not see the apartment until the day he headed home. After sharing a Saturday Evening Post column with her husband and writing another column for Life, Didion began her second novel. In 1970, “Play It As It Lays” was published and nominated for a National Book Award. Her editor on the book, Henry Robbins, remembers his first reaction: “It was a brilliant book but cold, almost icy. A devastating book. When I finished it, I wanted to call her up and ask her if she was all right. I did see it as the experience of despair.” Arranged in 84 staccatopaced takes, the elliptical prose is pared down, perfectly clean. The setting is the desert; the cast, the careless hedonists of Hollywood; the emotional climate, bleak as the surroundings. Having experienced a bad affair, a worse marriage, the birth of a brain‐damaged child and the abortion of another, Maria Wyeth suffers that exhaustion of the spirit born of disillusionment and emotional bankrupty. And yet, she survives. It is Maria, at the end of the book, who can say, “I know what ‘nothing’ means, and keep on playing. Why, BZ would say. Why I “Play It As It Lays” grew out of a scene Didion once observed at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas: At midnight, a woman in a white gown walked across the casino floor to answer a phone. Didion began asking herself, “Who is this woman? What had occurred in her past that she should at this very moment be paged in the middle of Las Vegas?” “A Book of Common Prayer,” published in 1977, similarly grew out of a single image. In the spring of 1973, Didion and Dunne had gone to South America to attend a film festival. While there, she contracted a case of paratyphoid and her weight dropped to 70 pounds. The entire trip took on a certain hallucinogenic quality, and an image of the Panama airport lodged in Didion's imagination. She became “obsessed with a picture of the airport — its heat, the particular color of the stucco and especially the light which absorbed.” The central character in “A Book of Common Prayer,” Charlotte Douglas, is also de afuera, an outsider. Imagining she can escape the past, she comes to the imaginery country of Boca Grande, where she is shot in a revolution — a casualty of her own romanticism. A technically difficult novel, the book received mixed reviews. As a number of critics pointed out, the device of a dispassionate, uninvolved narrator results in an oblique narrative that fails to win our complete sympathy for Charlotte's plight. Given the current visibility of the women's movement, there are those who see Didion's fiction as an example of that nebulous genre — “women's novels.” The women in her novels, after all, are haunted by the issues of mothers and daughters, blood and babies. Then, too, they are usually victims of men who have in some way failed them. The men in the novels — Ryder Channing in “Run River,” Ivan Costello in “Play It As It Lays,” and Warren Bogart in “A Book of Common Prayer” — are remarkably similar. All are brash, irreverent skeptics capable of almost cruel belligerence and possessed of a sexual charm that renders the women powerless. They are corrupters of innocence, destroyers of idealism. The women, for their part, are adept at coping with the immediate, the practical, but have trouble connecting the past with the future. Like Charlotte in “A Book of Common Prayer,” each believes she can remain “a tourist, a traveler with good will and good credentials and no memory.” Didion, however, maintains that her female characters “don't really have specifically women's problems; they have rather more general problems.” Indeed, Didion is skeptical of the women's movement. As she writes in “The White Album"": “To those of us who remain committed mainly to the exploration of moral distinctions and ambiguities, the feminist analysis ... [denies] one's actual apprehension of what it is like to be a woman, the irreconcilable difference of it — that sense of living one's deepest life underwater, that dark involvement with blood and birth and death.” Didion occasionally forces herself to do reporting (which she dislikes) to replenish her image bank, to gather new material for her novels. And in both “Play It As It Lays” and “A Book of Common Prayer,” the reporter's eye is very much in evidence, grounding the melodramatics of the plot in a precision of detail. Didion has carefully observed the manners and mores of the moneyed set that frequents Los Angeles and expertly records those observations with a mordant wit. “Le island. Le weekend. Les monkey‐gland injections,” babbles a silly socialite in “A Book of Common Prayer.” Asked about her husband at a cocktail party, Charlotte replies: “He runs guns. I wish they had caviar.” Ma Maison is one of those peculiarly Hollywood phenomena. A modest wooden structure on Melrose Avenue that resembles a country hamburger stand, it is probably the most celebrated celebrity hangout since Romanof f's in the days of the Rat Pack. On this particular Wednesday, George Cukor is there, as are Jackie Bisset, Dustin Hoffman and the Jack Lemmons. There are nods and greetings all around as the Dunnes and Carl Bernstein walk in for lunch. “The same old faces,” says Bernstein looking around. “This place never changes.” “No,” says Didion. “Time stands still here.” The Dunnes and Bernstein talk about writing as writers will: how many pages a day constitutes a good day's work; where the ideal place to write would be. Dunne, who, as his friend Calvin Trillin puts it, is a “creative gossip,” regales the others with stories, which Didion occasionally embroiders. The Dunnes’ work on screenplays has made them regulars on the local dinner party‐screening circuit, and they are frequently mentioned in The Hollywood Reporter's column “The Great Life” along with the likes of Bianca Jagger, Paul Morrissey and Linda Ronstadt. Collaborators on all their screenplays, the Dunnes regard writing for the movies not so much as a creative effort but as a respite from the solitary rigors of fiction and reportage, and they have worked on a dozen films, including dramatizations of “Play It As It Lays,” “The Panic in Needle Park” and “A Star Is Born.” They are currently finishing a screenplay of Diinne's best‐selling novel “True Confessions.” That project completed, Didion will go back to work on her next novel, “Angel Visits.” The title, she explains, comes from a Victorian expression meaning “pleasant visits of short duration.” Although the book started off as an extended dinner party in which the lives of three generations of a family are revealed, Didion says that the narrative of the book continues to change as she works on it. When she is in the midst of a book, Didion works at a typewriter in her office from 11 in the morning until 4 or 5 in the afternoon. Before cooking dinner (and she is an excellent cook), she sits down with a drink and her day's work, penciling in sentences, crossing out others. “Order and control are terribly important to me,” says Didion as she sits on a couch in her den, fingering a tiny green pillbox. “I would love to just have control over my own body — to stop the pain, to stop my hand from shaking. If I were 5 feet 10 and had a clear gaze and a good strong frame, I would not have such a maniacal desire for control because I would have it.” If control is elusive, order at least is provided by a multitude of domestic tasks Didion enjoys: making her own pastry; polishing the silver; taking her orchids to the greenhouse for repotting ; preparing dinner parties; helping Q. With her vocabulary. In Didion's novels, the women, too, practice little rituals — improvised regimens relied upon in lieu of any greater order. Even while she is wildly driving the highways, Maria “tried always to let the [gas station] attendant notice her putting the [Coke] bottle in the rack, a show of thoughtful responsibility.” There is in such gestures a means of warding off what Didion has called “the unspeakable peril of the everyday.” A means of keeping man's frail civilization roadmarked from the wilderness (the coyotes by the interstate, the snakes in the playpen; the fires and winds of California) that for Didion is always lurking just outside the house. “All the time we were living at the beach [in Trancas] I wanted a house like this,” she says of their twostory Colonial home. “I wanted a house with a center‐hall plan with the living room on your right and the dining hall on your left when you come in. I imagined if I had this house, a piece of order and peace would fall into my life, but order and peace did not fall into my life. Living in a two‐story house doesn't take away the risks.”"
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/10/archives/letters-salt-iis-threat-to-our-power-to-deter.html,"To the Editor: I ‘fully agree with Ambassador Gross (letter June 1) that nuclear weapons raise moral issues which touch the nature of democratic society. In the speech last summer from which he quoted, I characterized nuclear arms as “inherently repulsive” and recalled the American proposal of the Baruch Plan in 1974, venturing to predict and to hope that the Soviet Union would embrace those bold and inspiring ideals when it becomes tired of war and the risk of war, bored with empire and exhausted by the intricacies and uncertainties of nuclear calculation. But the Soviet Union rejected the Baruch Plan and is now a formidable nuclear power. As Secretary of Defense Brown said at Annapolis recently, the Soviet Union is striving to achieve a first‐strike nuclear capability. That effort contradicts Ambassador Gross's assumption that Moscow accepts what he calls the “sound doctrine of mutual deterrence.” We therefore have no choice but to maintain a clear and evident Amen‐ can second‐strike capability as “the foundation stone of stable deterrence,” in Ambassador Gross's phrase. Here again he and I agree, at least nominally. I say nominally because the second half of Ambassador Gross's letter seems to repudiate the notion of mutual deterrence through a credible second‐strike capability as a distortion “of traditional social values.” He adduces President Kennedy's handling of the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 as evidence for his assertion, on the ground that there was something morally wrong in the fact that our effective deterrent position  there was implicitly based on gruesome estimates of mass destruction. Ambassador Gross cannot have it both ways: that is, he cannot support nuclear deterrence as inescapable, and reject it as morally dubious. The Committee on the Present Danger does not advocate attempting to restore the position of nuclear and conventional‐force superiority we had in Cuba in 1962, a time when the Soviet nuclear program was just beginning to gain momentum. We do warn against allowing the Soviet Union to achieve a position of superiority comparable to ours in 1962. Such a development would neutralize the entire triad of our own nuclear force, and expose us to nuclear blackmail as well as nuclear war. Since 1976 we have reiterated steadily our view that the goal of our nuclear policy should be not to fight a nuclear war but to deter the Soviet threat to use or brandish nuclear weapons in world politics. If the SALT II treaty now in prospect. permitted us to preserve our second‐. strike capability and to take even a small step toward the goals of the Baruch Plan, I should support it with enthusiasm. Unfortunately, this is not the case. On the contrary, the present state of SALT negotiations is releasing dangerous pressures for arms escalation, nuclear proliferation and the policy of sauve qui pout, as confidence in the United States declines all over the world. EUGENE V. ROSTOW New Haven, June 4, 1979 The writer, professor of law at Yale, heads the executive committee of the Committee on the Present Danger. How Soviet V.I.P. Photos Are ‘Doctored’ To the Editor: Americans, including those whose special field of study is Russia, occasionally come up with some really fantastic notions about that country. Just how profoundly American specialists understand Russian affairs is evinced by a recent discovery in the field of Kremlinology — one described by David Binder in his May 28 news article, “Doctored Pictures Indicate Race to Succeed Brezhnev.” In comparing the traditional photographs of the Kremlin gerontocrats standing atop Lenin's tomb that were published in the Soviet newspapers on May Day, specialists from the C.I.A. and other Government organizations discovered that Politburo member Andrei Kirilenko was missing from the picture published in Vechernyaya Moskva. They concluded that Kirilenko had been replaced in the hierarchy by another Politburo member, Victor Grishin, who as head of the Moscow party organization controls that newspaper. Poor Kirilenko! He had fallen into disgrace simply through the good offices of the American Sovietologists. Perhaps the latter would do well to learn how those huge May Day photographs, which stretch clear across the front pages of Soviet newspapers, are put together. They are usually credited to several photographers, two at the very least. One photographs the left side of the tomb, and the other the right. Then the two pictures are pasted together. Sometimes the process is more complicated: the background is taken from one picture, and figures of Soviet leaders cut out from other photographs are pasted on it. In such cases, anyone can make a mistake. As one who has worked on Soviet newspapers, I recall many different errors made in this process. The fact that when the montage was being put together the editors merely mislaid Kirilenko was not such a great misfortune: they might have shown him twice — something that has happened to a Soviet leader more than once. No doubt Vechernyaya Moskva's editors received reprimands for their negligence. It would be interesting to know whether American officials in the White House, the State Department and the C.I.A. have likewise been reprimanded for interpreting a technical error as a sign of personnel changes at the top. One can easily imagine how much the Politburo members are amused at such “insights” into their lives. Let us hope that in their coverage of the Soviet Union's implementation of SALT lithe American specialists will be more attentive, and more profes sional. VLADIMIR SOLOVYOV. Rego Park, N.Y., June 2, 1979 The writer is a scholar‐in‐residence at Queens College. Rhodesian Cornerstone To the Editor: It was to the Old Testament, Psalm 118, that Bishop Abel Muzorewa turned to express his emotion upon the proclamation of the new nation, Zimbabwe Rhodesia, gaying, “This is the day which the Lord bath made.. .” There is another verse in that psalm which could well be recalled in this connection: “The stone which the builders refused [for stone read black man] is become the head stone of the corner.” ARTHUR J. MORGAN New York, June 1, 1979 A Healer Who Joined The Execution Team To the Editor: According to The New York Times, there was a physician present at the execution of John Spenkelink. Not only was this anonymous individual present, but he also ascertained twice that Mr. Spenkelink was still alive after the first and second attempts to kill him, and he signaled the other executioners to repeat their efforts. Twice he had the opportunity to attempt to resuscitate Mr. Spenkelink and instead facilitated the execution. Moreover, this person was not under duress when he performed his work. This behavior, by a licensed physician, is a violation of the Hippocratic principles to preserve life and “above all do no harm.” His name should be revealed so that the community of physicians who abide by the Hippocratic Oath can evaluate this person's behavior and determine whether or not he should be allowed to remain a member of the licensed medical community. My own opinion is that such a person must choose whether he wishes to remain a physician and abide by his oath to preserve life or renounce his medical status and acknowledge that he is part of the execution team. DOROTHY OTNOW LEWIS. M.D. Clinical Professor of Psychiatry Yale University New Haven, May 31, 1979 The Male Burden To the Editor: Ross Stagner's June 3 letter about “pregnancy permission” offers a quite simple‐minded solution. Perhaps instead of requiring unmarried females under 18 to obtain parental permission to become pregnant, unmarried males  of any age (including those not married to the female in question) should be required to obtain permission of both sets of parents before impregnating a minor female. Now who pays for the abortion? PATRICIA A. ST. JOHN Elizabeth, N.J., June 3, 1979 Robert McNamara's ‘Crimes Against the Public Weal’ To the Editor: James Reston's own life has been of such a single piece — values believed in, values lived — that it is a considerable shame that he uses his considerable talents and moral influence in an attempt to rehabilitate Robert McNamara, one of the most disturbingly flawed civil servants of this era [column May 25]. It is true, as Reston says, that the contradiction between the arms race and the hunger race is one of the great underdiscussed issues of this age, but it is by no means true, as Reston suggests, that McNamara is a valid spokesman on this or any other subject. This is not, for example, his first major speech on the subject; he spoke in much the same vein while Secretary of Defense, when it was also true that he was one of the great arms salesmen of the Western world, in no small part because it helped the Pentagon budget and made it, in the McNamara phrase, more cost effective. More importantly, McNamara's own, still‐unexplained public acts on Vietnam militate against his voice as a moral one in this society, and his entire role there contradicts the image of a man who will sacrifice his career for moral purposes. If anything, the real McNamara is quite different, someone who says one thing in public and always follows the mandate of his superiors in private, dissembling not just to the press and the public but to his high‐level colleagues in Government. In truth, McNamara lied and deceived the Senate and the press and the public at the time of the Tonkin Gulf Resolution (out of loyalty to the President and at the expense of a larger loyalty to the truth and to the democratic process). He consistently lied to the nation about the levels of increment of troops. (Mr. Reston once used the phrase that Lyndon Johnson took us to war by stealth; he is right, and Johnson's great pathfinder at the time was McNamara). He set requirements for the field commanders there that resulted, inevitably, in the abhorrent body count. One of his most appalling deceptions of both his colleagues in the Government and the American people came in January of 1966 when he told budget officials and the Council of Economic Advisers that he forecast a small war and thus there was no need to go for a tax increase, when in fact he had already promised General Westmoreland a minimum of 400,000 troops. That particular lie, done out of loyalty, of course, helped give the nation the inflation that is still with us. Some officials of the Nixon Administration, I suspect, went to prison for far smaller crimes against the public weal. But his greatest crime, like that of his colleague McGeorge Bundy, was the crime of silence. From 1969 on, after Nixon took over and the national debate about Vietnam tore this nation apart, McNamara, who allegedly knew more about the war than anyone else, remained silent. In that period’ 18,000 young Americans and countless thousands of Vietnamese died. Mr. Reston says that McNamara “opposed the war.” That is simply not true. At the tail end of his tour as De fense Secretary, he argued to limit the bombing. That is very different from opposing the war. After leaving office, he did criticize the war in very careful private conversations with very selected journalists, words spoken more to enhance his own slipping personal position rather than be a part of the painful national debate. Thus were the good citizens of Georgetown who opposed the war allowed to think that McNamara was with them, as later, under much the same kind of personal manipulation, they were allowed to think that Henry Kissinger opposed the Cambodia incursion. This is the central point about McNamara. In the excesses of office out of loyalty to the President, he is much like the now‐departed Mr.’ Haldeman. But unlike Mr. Haldeman, he is a far more dangerous figure. For Haldeman never fooled anyone; he was palpably what he was, whereas it was McNamara's special skill to fool people better than he, to seem better than his official acts and thus to keep part of his reputation. Not all of us are, like Mr. Reston, impressed by his $100,000‐a‐year penance at the World Bank, and we reject his role as spokesman on a moral issue like this. We got no speeches from him in the past. We need none from him now. DAVID HALBERSTAM. New York, May 29, 1979 Jan Sawka"
The Region,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/10/archives/the-region-in-summary-hartford-assembly-achieves-its-aim-no-new.html,"“No man's life, liberty or property is safe while the Legislature is in session;” an old sage said years ago. Last week, the Connecticut General Assembly ended any threat it might have posed to that state's citizens by adjourning. New Yorkers, meanwhile, have at least another week to wait before their legislators call it quits. The Connecticut lawmakers distinguished themselves as much by what they didn't do during the session as by what they did. The House majority leader, John G. Groppo, put it bluntly: “Nb taxes.” The legislators also refrained from tinkering much with Gov. Ella T. ‘ Grasso's budget recommendation, passing a $2.4 billion package, 5.5 percent, higher than last year's. Mrs. Grasso, in a speech at the adjournment, praised the lawmakers on the budget, which enabled her to keep a Carnpaign promise of no new taxes. Under pressure from the courts, the General Assembly also managed to to pass a new school aid law to reduce gross disparities in spending between Connecticut's rich districts and its poorer ones. The carefully crafted measure will cost almost $400 million over its five‐year phase‐in period, but still will enable Connecticut to avoid imposing an income tax. One other important piece of legislation was the coastal area management bill. Passed after much debate, the law is intended to conserve some of Connecticut's remaining undeveloped shoreline and protect it from environmental damage. As in New York, abortion opponents were at work in Connecticut. They sought, but didn't get, a bill to require that minors obtain parental permission before having abortions. Asbestos Check Clears 4 Towns In the innocent days of yesteryear, Americans sprayed herbicides indiscriminately, dumped waste in any open space and even used pipes made with asbestos in water systems. In Connecticut, there are an estimated 900 miles of asbestos‐cement water pipe. For the last several years — since the potential dangers of asbestos were recognized — state and Federal officials have been trying to determine how much of it leaks into drinking water. Last week, the state Health Department said recent tests in four towns, Farmington, Sprague, Simsbury and East Lyme, where they found significant amounts of asbestos in the water two years, ago showed virtually none now, But that good news was tempered immediately by Richard Woodhull, a Health Department official. “It might have been a propitious sample,” said Mr. Woodhull, adding that new tests already are planned. After the tests two years ago, the state advised local water utilities to take certain measures, including more frequent flushing of ‘mains, to reduce the asbestos content of the water. Mr. Woodhull said the samples used in the recent tests May have been taken right after a flushing and, thus, may not have been representative. Ingestion of asbestos has been linked to cancer and lung disorders in humans. However, Dr. John Lewis, another Connecticut Health Department official, said his studies have shown no correlation between asbestos in drinking water there and cancer rates. “We certainly can't say that in Connecticut there is a correlation,” he said. “But we also can't say it's safe.” Despite the potential danger from asbeatos, Di. Lewis said asbestos‐cement pipe is still being installed in some water systems around the country, adding to the 200,000 miles already in use. Another Storm Over Hongisto The career of Richard D. Hongisto is what newspapers call ""good copy.” In the early 1960's, as Sheriff of San Francisco, he served five days behind bars for contempt of court after refusing to evict elderly tenants in Chinatown. Previously, he had been under heavy fire for supporting homosexual rights and restraints on police use of guns. In 1977, after three months as Police Chief of Cleveland, he was ousted after attacking the mayor (who had appointed him) for pressuring the police to commit “unethical acts.” Last week, the rapid‐firing former sheriff was in trouble again. As acting Correctional Services Administrator, in charge of New York State's prisons and prisoners, he was facing difficult confirmation hearings by a panel of the State Senate when he acknowledged that he and his wealthy wife had each contributed $250 last month to the Borough Presidency campaign of Joseph Galiber, a member of the State Senate's Crime and Corrections Committee and a consistent supporter of the nominee. To make things worse, the contributions were made under another name. Governor Carey didn't withdraw the nomination but an aide privately doubted that Mr. Hongisto would now be confirmed even though a spokesman for the Governor said there “wasn't anything illegal.” At the Department of Elections, there was disagreement with that position. An attorney quoted the Election Law: “No person shall many name except his own, directly or indirectly, make a payment to a candidate or political committee.’ New Prescription For Generic Drugs When it took effect 14 months ago, New York State's generic prescription drug law was touted as a potential big moneysaver for consumers. It hasn't lived up to that billing, so last week the State Assembly passed a bill to make sure it does. But the betting in Albany is that the meassure won't make it through the Senate. The bill would require that all prescriptions be filled with generic drugs unless the physician specifies in writing on the prescription order that a brand‐name product be used. The law now mandates generic substitution by pharmacists only when the doctor has signed a special line on the prescription form allowing it, something most doctors don't do. Timothy Gilles, a spokesman for Attorney General Robert Abrams, who backed the bill, said that in states where the automatic use of generics is required, doctors specify brand names only about one time in ten. Consumer advocates have argued all along that the automatic use of generics should be mandated. But their case was made graphically last week In the results of a survey by the offices of the Attorney General and the New York City Consumer Affairs Commissioner. Pharmacists at 67 of nearly 300 drug stores surveyed failed to substitute a generic for a brand‐name drug when the substitution was required by law. Fifty of the offenders were in the New York City area and they were slapped with fines totaling more than $20,000. Mr. Gilles said action against the others is still pending. $12.5 Million Does Not a Prison Make Three years ago, New Jersey voters approved a $12.5 million bond issue for a new prison. Since then, those same voters have refused to touch the concrete reality with a ten‐foot crowbar. They want a new prison, but not in their own backyard. Some have offerred novel alternatives. “We've been told to buy a boat and anchor the prisoners out on the Delaware River,” said Richard Seidl, Assistant Commissioner of Corrections. State officials have examined the stockade at Fort Dix for use when and if it becomes available. It is newer than most state prisons, especially Trenton, which still uses buildings constructed in 1835. “Then the same type of local ,opposition cropped up,” Mr. Seidl said. “Area Congressmen blocked the plan.” Then the state sought to build the new 300‐cell, medium‐security institution on the Jersey City waterfront, in Newark (near the airport) and in rural Hopewell Township. All efforts were rebuffed by local opposition. Mayor Kenneth A. Gibson of Newark said he would welcome the prison in parts of the city but not on vacant industrial land. William H. Fauver, the Corrections Commissioner, and other state officials believe the Newark area would be ideal because 22 percent of the prisoners are committed by Essex County courts. State officials said they hoped the 300 new Jobs in the prison would overcome opposition from the East Ward, whose residents have so far scuttled the proposal. Camden, at the other end of the state, is now reported high on the list but no one wants to talk about it for fear of scaring the neighbors. Alvin Davis and Don Wycliff"
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/11/archives/letters-the-oil-thats-waiting-for-the-us-consumer-unjust-criticism.html,"To my great dismay, The Times is once again espousing a shortsighted, easy answer to our energy problem the export of Alaskan oil (“The Oil That's Waiting for Congress,” editorial May 30). To the Editor: Inasmuch as the major oil companies have failed to maintain the commitment they made to develop a domestic distribution system for Alaskan oil (a breach of faith the editorial excuses), The Times has embraced the notion that the United States can “stimulate” domestic petroleum production by engaging in a trilateral swap with Japan and Mexico. The idea is not new, having been first advanced in the mid‐1970's, but then the third partner was Iran, not Mexico. We were told by the Nixon and Ford Administrations that the Shah's friendly and stable regime was a good one to do business with. Now it's Mexico, whose Gulf Coast. oil fields have caused us to clutch this oft‐neglected. neighbor to our bosom much like an abandoned son who has won the Irish Sweepstakes. The happenstance of a common boundary and the newly found warmth we feel toward our neighbor to the south have convinced The Times that if we use their oil we will be less dependent on (incredibly) foreign sources. It should be remembered that our client neighbor in South America, Venezuela, is a member of OPEC (and frequently leads the charge for higher prices) and that our neighbor to the north, Canada, with whom we share another common boundary, has all but shut off oil exports to the U.S. But never mind that, The Times tells us, if Mexico stops sending oil to us (in a swap), we'll just stop sending oil to Japan. So, there! Oh, would that it be so easy. The problem, of course, is, if that day did come we would be back at square one, with no domestic distribution system in place; more dependent upon OPEC than ever before, and in retaliation the Japanese would prob. ably begin to eat the dollar alive. The bottom line is this: The major oil companies will increase Alaskan production and make a fair profit by doing so when they realize that the only new market available to, them is the one in the continental United States. As you know, the Congress is on the brink of persuading the nation's oil companies that such is true as the members consider the provisions of the Export Administration Act of 1979. That bill, containing an amendment prohibiting the export of Alaskan oil, is moving toward floor action in the House and Senate at this time. I expect that when consideration is concluded, the major oil companies will discover a new market — the one that's always existed here at home. STEWART B. MCKINNEY Member of Congress, 9th Dist., Conn. Washington, May 31, 1979 Unjust Criticism Of the Javitses To the Editor: One cannot say that Monday‐morning quarterbacking is un‐American; it is a national pastime. But it seems hardly just or defensible to visit retroactive criticism and ridicule on Marion and Senator Javits, as you did in your June 1 editorial “The Ma‐and‐Pa Javits Store.” As recently as last summer the socalled Shah, whom we now know as butcher of his people, was a pillar of the “free world” and our enduring pal. Multiple multinationals paid him and his establishment tribute. If Mrs. Javits was wrong to take at face value our Government's avowals that this was our country's great and good friend (and hence kosher to work for), that does not seem to me to call for a new scolding for a matter which was resolved at the time. Nor does it justify the unexpected condemnation of a Republican Senator more capable, useful and progressive than most of his Democratic colleagues with the harsh phrase, undocumented, “The Javits family trades in influence.” HOWARD N. MEYER Rockville Centre, L.I., June I, 1979 Flaws in New York's Narcotics Law To the Editor: The New York State Legislature is now reviewing New York's mandatory sentences for narcotic offenses. In my view, extensive revision is essential. Penalties for heroin and cocaine violations are based on the aggregate weight of seized narcotics. As heroin passes down the pyramid of illicit distribution, it is diluted to increase its bulk. The bottom‐rung offender is penalized more severely than a top distributor whose pure heroin weighs less than the diluted street product. The law makes no distinction between cocaine and heroin. Cocaine is not a narcotic, is not addictive and is not criminogenic. It should be classified with other stimulants. The law authorizes sentences of one year to life. The gap between one year and life is unreasonable. Probation is now impossible except for informers, with the consent of the prosecutor. Judges, not prosecutors, should decide who is placed on probation, for sentencing is the responsibility of judicial authority. Life sentences and limitations on plea bargaining for minor offenders violates fundamental concepts of justice. They are also counterproductive since they jam courts and prisons with petty offenders, compelling the authorities to deal lightly with homicides and other violent offenses. Federal law authorizes life sentences for persons who occupy a supervisory role in narcotics traffic. This approach makes more sense than present state lam DAVID BERNHEIM New York, June 1, 1979 Sue Coe To the Editor: Youssef M. Ibrahim describes his experience in crossing the border from Jordan to Israel (news story May 29) but fails to make the most significant observation that the two countries are in a state of war. It is only Israel's humanitarian policy of the “Open Bridges” that makes the movement of civilians back and forth possible. Thus, last year over a million crossings were recorded on the two bridges, most of them of Arabs from Jordan, Judea and Samaria, Gaza, Lebanon, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other Arab League countries. Hundreds of trucks carrying produce and other goods cross the bridges daily and maintain the undisrupted trading patterns on which Arabs on both sides depend for their needs and livelihood. The Arab civilian who is subjected to the ordeal of a thorough security check may be innocent, but some of his compatriots are not. Explosives and arms smuggled through the borders facilitated terrorist acts which resuited during the last 10 years in 1,130 civilian deaths and 2,471 serious injuries. One shudders to think how much higher that toll could be if security measures were less stringent. The Palestinian merchant who told Mr. Ibrahim that every time he goes through the bridges he asks himself, “How can we make peace with these people?” obviously does not appreciate, or does not want to admit, that “these people,” who take pains and risks in maintaining the freedom of movement he enjoys, deserve his consideration as partners in peace. But Mr. Ibrahim, as an independent observer, should recognize that. SHMUEL MOYAL Consul and Press Officer Consulate of Israel New York, June 6, 1979 To the Editor: In a June 2 letter, Samm Sinclair Baker expresses confusion as to the deterrent effect of capital punishment and asks that unbiased experts analyze the existing data to provide an empirical answer. Such a study has already been completed, financed by the National Science Foundation and conducted under the direction of Dr. Isaac Ehrlich of the National Bureau of Economic Research. The results of this sophisticated, analytical study were published in the June 1975 issue of the American Economic Review. Professor Ehrlich (who has never been an advocate of capital punishment and who has no ax to grind) estimated that each failure to execute a convicted murderer results in the murder of somewhere between seven and eieht additional innscent victims. JOSEPH TEMPLEMAN Brooklyn, June 4, 1979 To the Editor: It's hard to reconcile The Times's frequent criticism of municipal hospitals with your editorial position on the affiliation between New York Medical College and Lincoln and Metropolitan Hospitals. New York Medical will receive $24 million to provide medical services to these hospitals, but there is doubt whether the college, now affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, will perform abortions. There is a simple solution. If New York Medical cannot assure all municipal patients the services they are entitled to, get another affiliate. New York Medical has every right to adhere to its own principles, but on its own money, not municipal hospital funds. The Times is prepared to wait and see “whether the Medical College serves the Archdiocese, the city or both.” The Times can afford to wait. But what about the women who will be penalized if it turns out that the college didn't serve the city? By the time any rectification occurs, their lives may have been seriously distorted. A preliminary report by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare has stated that anticipated closings of municipal hospitals will violate the civil rights of minority‐group residents of this city by depriving them of access to health care. Arbitrarily curtailing services within a hospital will be more of the same. Interestingly, we read of the possibility of the corporation's hiring additional doctors to perform abortions, but there is no suggestion of a reduction in the $24 million contract. Will New York Medical get the same $24 million whether it performs abortions or not? And will The Times include the added costs of these abortions in future criticism of H.H.C. costs? In fact, is The Times satisfied that the entire $29 million expenditure is justified and will be properly monitored? In the simplest terms, the terms we hear most often applied by critics of New York's social programs, what kind of way is this to do business? If a Jewish‐affiliated hospital should decide not to deliver services on the Sabbath will that be O.K. too? If a contractor to the city is not prepared to fulfill the complete contract, why should the lives of patients and the funds of the city be placed in any jeopardy? At $24 million a year there are other qualified affiliates available. It is difficult to understand how a vigorous critic of H.H.C. management can tolerate a soft, unbusinesslike arrangement like this. EDWARD HANDMAN District Council 37 American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees New York, May 28, 1979 To the Editor: The Administration's reason for not giving our missiles silo‐busting capability is most peculiar: U.S. ability to destroy ground‐based missiles would be seen as an intolerable threat to Moscow. My question is: Why isn't Moscow's ability to destroy our missiles an intolerable threat to us? GAMALIEL ISAAC Irvington, N.Y., June 1, 1979 To the Editor: In reply to Brian Mead's recent letter on his disaffection with the current usage of Celsius in lieu of centigrade: The Celsius and Fahrenheit scales are so called in honor of the scientists who invented them. In 1742 Anders Celsius (yes, an astronomer) chose as two fixed and reproducible points for thermometry the melting point of ice and the boiling point of water. The distance between he divided into 100 degrees; thus this is a centigrade scale. It has always been called the Celsius scale throughout the scientific world except in the U.S., Great Britain and Italy. Finally, in 1948, at the General Conference of Weights and Measures, CelOus was formally adopted as the universal name. Gabriel Fahrenheit, a physicist, about 30 years before Celsius, selected as his two fixed points the coldest ternperature he could achieve in the laboratory (that of a salt‐ice mixture) and that of the human body. This range he divided into 96 degrees, body temperature registering as 96. Thus, if Dr. Fahrenheit had been running a few degrees of fever or had chosen to divide his scale into 100 degrees rather than 96, the Fahrenheit scale would also be a centigrade scale, but not the Celsius scale.

The majority of the jurors, voting 11 to 1, favored acquittal. Dr. Waddill's lawyer protested that the absence of a verdict would leave his client with continuing problems, but Judge Byron McMillon of Superior Court said the time had come to dismiss the case. The jurors had deliberated for 48 hours over nine'days, It was the second trial for the 48‐yearold obstetrician. In May 1978, after four months of testimony, a jury deadlocked 7 to 5, ‘with the majority favoring Dr. Waddill's acquittal. The case arose in 1977 when Dr. Waddill administered a saline solution to abort the fetus of 18‐year‐old Mary Weaver. After returning home from the hospital, he received a call from the hospital that the baby appeared to be alive. There is disagreement over what happened when Dr. Waddill arrived at the hospital. A pediatrician told police that he saw Dr. Waddill with his hand on the baby's throat, strangling it. Dr. Waddill denied the charge. Workers Find the Oil Leak That Closed Alaska Pipeline ANCHORAGE, Alaska, June 11 (UPI) — Work crews digging into Alaska's frozen North Slope today in winds of up to 75 miles per hour uncovered a crack in the Trans‐Alaska oil pipeline large enough to account for the leakage of more than 1,500 barrels of crude oil. “The crews found a crack in the pipe five inches long and one‐sixteenth of an inch wide,” said John Ratterman, a spokesman for Alyeska, the company operating the line, which was shut down when the leak was discovered. The crack was found in a section of the pipe where a wrinkle was found earlier, indicating that the pipe had buckled. Mr. Ratterman said that the crew would look for further damage. Mr. Ratterman said cleanup crews had recovered 450 barrels of oil that had seeped into the Atigun river. Asked how long the shutdown would continue if the five‐inch crack turned out to be the only damage to the pipeline, Ratterman said, “It would be a matter of a day or two, but we won't know until the entire circumference of the damaged section is uncovered.” Spokesmen for oil companies said there was a three‐day supply in tanks at the Port of Valdez. Mississippi Primary Plan Rejected as ‘Racially Biased WASHINGTON, June 11 (UPI) — Calling the plan racially discriminatory, the Justice Department rejected today Mississippi's effort to create an open primary system under which only the two top vote‐getters could run in general elections. Blacks had strongly objected to the proposal passed by the Mississippi Legislature, contending that it would greatly reduce chances for minorities to win statewide office and also would hurt the two‐party system. It was the third time in the last five years that the Justice Department had rejected Mississippi's attempt to switch to an open primary system. Drew Days, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the civil rights division, said in a letter to Mississippi's Attorney General, A.F. Summer, that the change would eliminate the “political advantage that blacks have obtained” in recent elections. He said an open primary system not only would reduce the role of political parties, but would introduce a new majority vote requirement for winning general elections where a plurality previously was sufficient."
Jersey Assembly Supports Curbs In All Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/12/archives/jersey-assembly-supports-curbs-in-all-abortions.html,"TRENTON, June 11 — A bill that would make abortions more difficult to obtain in New Jersey passed the State Assembly today, 51 to 17, and was sent to the Senate. Special to The New York Times The bill would require that virtually all abortions be performed in hospitals, thereby doubling the $350 cost of the procedure now available in physicians offices or in clinics. It would require physicians to inform each woman seeking an abortion about the possible dangers, obtain her written consent and then wait 48 hours — except in medical emergencies — before proseeding with the abortion. The physician also would be required to inform the woman of agencies that would provide economic assistance to her and encouragement to carry her child to term. After the vote had been taken and the lawmakers had left the chamber, memtiers of Right to Life organizations, which oppose abortions, applauded in the Spectators gallery, and members of Right to Choose groups sang “We Shall Overcome.” AssemblynIan Thomas J. Deverin, Democrat of Carteret and the bill's chief sponsor, said the measure was an exercise of the Legislature's right to regulate medical procedures to insure the health of the woman — and of her baby in the case of a live‐aborted infant. The bill would make it a criminal offense for anyone to take the life of a liveaborted infant. The penalties extend to 10 years in prison.

The officials said they would not make public the names of the agencies involved until their cases go to court. The civil disobedience involves an effort to test the I.R.S. definition of “integrated auxiliaries” of churches, a major point of dispute in church‐state relations. Revenue service regulations say that organizations judged to be “nonintegrated auxiliaries” of the church and thus “not religious” in nature, are required to file an I.R.S. information Form 990 disclosing financial information about the agency. The agencies involved in the protest deliberately missed the May 15 filing deadline, church officials said."
Hers,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/14/archives/hers.html,"GOOD taste has been decreed. This year in Metropolis it's Michelangelo, garish running shoes, Le Fromage Triste for lunch. Why does it seem that in matters of taste we are so often bullied? Yes, ordered about. See this. Hear that. Tap dance. Buy Victorian. Unload Utrillo. For God's sake, lower your hem. Blow dry. Filter. Snort. The great weight of fashionable opinion. We all have our shameful little secrets. I dislike most French restaurants, all tapestries, Wagner across the board. When I am driven mad with the notion that the only alternative to being smug and correct is to be petulant and gutty, I turn to my neighbors, those free spirits, Art and Vera Less. I shall never forget the sweltering day when they moved into the small Tudor apartment house that ruins the row of brownstones on the block … Art, sweating in his La Cruste shirt with its mysterious salamander over the heart … Vera, puffing in Taiwan sneakers and a splashy Danish sack. With Muffles, their half‐breed on the lead, Art supervised the movers‐true amateurs. How beautifully matched they seemed, mutt and master — Art's barrel chest and little low legs, Muffles's heavy sheep dog head and sleek dachshund body scraping the curb. Vera, a vibrant streaky blonde, clung to her treasure, a near‐Tiffany lamp. The pavements sizzled and as a friendly gesture went to my refrigerator and brought the Lesses a sixpack of icy Coke. They accepted, but a look of wry intimacy flashed between them; I was soon to learn that they had discovered an exquisite celery tonic, the ne plus ultra of soft drinks, manufactured in Mineola, L.I., and shipped to them by the case. They are, Vera and Art Less, the dear familiar snobs in reverse, champions of the unknown, the unheralded, the second‐rate. In this world of blind sheep and anxious toadies, they are fiercely independent. What a treat it is to go to their apartment for a Saturday — never a Sunday ‐ brunch. The vodka for the Bloody Marys is their odd house brand, Lord Muckintyre; the Worcestershire a strangely bitter new taste delight. All about us we can observe the life that might be ours were we not slaves to fashion. No quiche, no fine china. Pastrami on ersatz rye. Yugoslav mustard served in a Melmac cereal bowl. Their furniture, a hodgepodge, with slight tears, dents and indecipherable scratches, is straight department store — all seconds. If the charm of the ordinary seems to wear thin when we are served the cheapest of Neapolitan ice cream bricks with Oreo cookies for dessert, Art's offbeat politics enchant us anew. His is pro‐nuke, pro. welfare, anti‐abortion, anti‐whale. For fear of being fashionably predictable be will not declare himself high on Carter when the polls are low. Actually, it is politics that brought Vera and Art together. As empty young things campaigning for Stevenson they revealed to each other that their allegiance was half baked. On the one hand Adlai was fine mind, a cultivated man, hideously tasteful to them in manner. On the other hand they sensed a real loser after their own hearts. Over the years the lAssses have never cast a vote for a candidate who's wort. Such purity of personal vision is rare. Raise the Lake Erie chablis in a final toast, before Vera pours our instant coffee into chipped mugs. Vera is looking swell in a jumper from her discount house. It was something of a trauma when everyone started buying secondhand clothes — old piano shawls and Harlowe bed jackets — an idea she'd thought up 20 years ago in her search for the dowdy and true. A feminist at heart, she has recently embraced the movement now that it has lost its flash and is slugging along. The Leases are like lovers still, off to Clint Eastwood movies with the same unbotmcled enthusiasm they once gave to Doris Day romps. Off season they go to forgettable islands or tour the dead mill towns of New England. It is, on the whole, a happy life, though their son, Willy, has gone soft at the center and bought a bundle of conventional camp — so it's minor Judy and Marilyn for him, Etvis in “Blue Hawaii,” Gidget flicks and Carmen Miranda. Obvious junk for the discriminating snob in reverse. Poor Will, he honors his heritage — still adores peanut butter Nabs and Orange Julius, still loves the unaffected, the flawed, the second best — but it is too hard day atter day. Now he wants his own apartment where be can sell out in peace‐ slurp Champale cut of his Shirley Temple glass, listen to Betty Hutton and Jeanette MacDonald — happy as a pig in schlock. Hope, the promising daughter, is away at an tmpretentious college in southern Idaho and has taken literary turn. The apple of Art's eye, she has discovered that Lear isn't much of a play, indeed, most the Bard is awfully overrated. Marlowe and Nashe are the genuine articles. Ditto Dorothy Richardson who's got it over Virginia Woolf. What splendid letters Hope Less writes home, brushing aside Ulysses to explicate the mytholoical underpinnings of a magnificent Raymond Chandler mystery and the hieratic structure of “Gone With the Wind.” This summer, the better to prepare herself for a thesis on negative capability, she will camp in the lesser Tetons with her beau who plays second fiddle in the Boise symphonette. I admit that when I leave the Lenses’ down‐toearth universe, I come directly home, put on the Chopin etudes and get an earful of Rubinstein while sip C,ourvoisier. I am happy, for a while, to accept whatever news the fashionable world may throw at me about purses and peace treaties. I will assume the “right” attitudes. But next week, thank heaven, will go with Vera and Art to a diner they found on Eighth Avenue that has not been touched since the mid‐50's and eat chili out of thick restaurant china and the best pumpkin pie in the city.

Top French Delegate Hopeful About Ew‐opean Assembly,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/15/archives/top-french-delegate-hopeful-about-european-assembly-hopes-to-form.html,"PARIS, June 14 — The leading French delegate to the newly elected European Assembly, often derided for its lack of power or attacked for its hope of greater power, takes a firmly moderate position, in seeping wan its predominantly centerright political makeup. She thinks it will be able to do a lot for its 280 million constitutents, provided it moves with “small steps.” Sirnone Veil, who headed the winning list of candidates in France and is bound to have a highly visible post when the Common Market's Parliament convenes in Strasbourg next month, is a 51-year-old woman who never ran for office before.’ But for the last five years, she has been Health Minister and regularly topped the polls as the country's most popular public official. “Europe won't really progress if tries to impose supranational rules, outside of national contexts,” she said in an interview. “Trying to harmonize national laws is a much better method, bringing countries into similar lines. They have to move closer before they can think together.” As usual, the basically nonpolitical Mrs. Veil had a concrete example law she recently steered through the French National Assembly reforming medical education requirements. Actually, it was written to standardize the situation in all European Community countries. But, she said, it would never have been approved in Paris as a Common Market requirement imposed on France. Presented as a useful domestic development, it had no trouble. The Assembly in Strasbourg, she said, will be able to make recommendations both to the European Commission and to national governments, offer amendments to directives from the community's Council of Ministers, and probably block undesirable initiatives from the commission by its power of persuasion. It is not a lot, she conceded, but it does prove “that Europe exists,” and she is committed to European integration. Mrs. Veil is an elegant *man, always cool and practical, who believes that attention to the details of everyday life is what makes the difference in government, not ideologies. “General ideas are all very well in politics,” she said, “but if they're not translated into specifics and logistics, they solve nothing.” It is precisely her calm, efficient nonpolitician approach that has won her so much admiration in France. She intends to continue that way in Strasbourg, giving the Assembly her full time. She will probably seek appointment to the committee on relations with underdeveloped countries, she said, but her interests also focus on social measures and in particular the problems of women. Hopes to Form Women's Group “I hope we can establish a women's hitergroup because the condition is growing distressing. In national parliaments, women are isolated and have little chance to be effective. There will be many more of us in Strasbourg, and there are very strong women's demands from Europe.” The “intergroup” would be a women's. caucus that crossed, party and national lines and Mrs. Veil made clear she had specific issues in mind. They include employment, equal pay, family allotments, whether to pay a maternity “salary” for women who quit work to have babies or extend their right to maternity leave, and the problems of women who live alone or head households. Mrs. Veil's first campaign was something of a trial for her, though she managed to come through with the gentle broad‐faced smile that is her almost unvarying expression. There was a series of particularly nasty incidents at the end, the day that Pope John Paul II was in Auschwitz. A group of right‐wing rowdies followed her from meeting to meeting, shouting “Murderess!” “Dirty Jew!” and “Veil equals Hitler!” It was an allusion to her having put through France's liberal abortion law, not to the fact that as a teen‐ager she was deported to Auschwitz and lost her mother, father, and brother there. She replied from the platform: “I'm not afraid of you, you poor man's SS I've survived worse.” Afterward, she said calmly: “I wasn't insulted because I disdain them so much. I don't hate easily but I do hate them because they would be dangerous if they ever had any power. But they shouldn't be dramatized. They can't get 1 percent of the vote. There always has been a violent, anti‐Semite extreme though, and they're still around.” More distressing to her, she said, were the attacks by other women politicians during the campaign. One said, “She hasn't a single personal idea,” and another ridiculed her handsome, relaxed campaign poster, a picture taken once when she was on vacation, as “just another ad for the Club Mediterrande.” “I really regretted these personal attacks ,from women, at a level I thought was terrible,” she said. “It makes the antifeminists sound right.” How She Caine to Run Mrs. Veil's candidaty was the result of the intricate French political situation. Former Prime Minister Jacques Chirac presented a list of his own, and did badly, sliding to fourth position among the major French parties although his neoGaullists are members of the Government coalition. But neither President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, who presents himself as above partisanship, nor Prime Minister Raymond Barre, who ostensibly represents the whole coalition, could head a rival list without jeopardizing Mr. Chirac's. So Mrs. Veil was drafted as the most attractive personality available to lead a list pledged to support Mr. Giscard d'Estaing's policies. From the Goverrunont's point of view, it did quite well, coming in first. In the 1978 national elections a similar group trailed Mr. Chirac's party. Mrs. Veil was born in Nice, July 13, 1927. After surviving Auschwitz, she marrieda government official, studied law, and took a job in the ‐Ministry of Justice,, where she dealt with penal affairs and rose rapidly. Her ambition, until she was plucked out of the bureaucracy to becaine. a Giscard d'Estaing Cabinet minister,, had been to direct France's penitentiary system and to reform it, she said recentr ly.

Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/16/archives/letters-to-nation-gasoline-fairly-silent-sufferers-city-hospitals-a.html,"To the Editor: The June 7 letter by Professors Scarf and Tobin confuses the rejection by Congress of President Carter's standby gas rationing plan with rejection of the concept of rationing. In fact, it was the feeling of many members of Congress — including myself — that we do need a standby plan to ration gasoline in the event of a shortage. We considered the President's plan to be fatally flawed because it was based on the initial allocation of fuel to vehicles rather than to individuals. Such a plan penalizes low‐income households where many people use the same car for all their transportation needs in favor of well-to-do, multi‐car households. It actually would have given less gas to those who have been trying to conserve by using mass transit or carpools. I believe that it is possible to design an equitable plan for rationing gasoline that is based on individual allocations — perhaps to licensed drivers and weighted according to geographic realities. We should include a set‐aside for state governors to administer ,within their states to cover essential occupations, social services, and hard• ship cases, thereby recognizing the need for local participation in making the most difficult choices. Because such a plan would be fundamentally fair, it would be more likely to be respected and would therefore ul- timately be more effective. I do not believe it is beyond the capabilities of this Administration — or Congress, if need be — to design a rationing plan with these features. The American people are entitled to no less. BARBARA A. MIKULSKI Member of Congress, 3d Dist., Md. Washington, June 8, 1979 Silent Sufferers To the Editor: Professors Scarf and Tobin's letter is admirable in all but one respect. The authors fail to recognize that America today acknowledges hardship only when it befalls organized interests. Those who suffer in long gas lines have no associations, advocates or spokesmen. Without these accouterments, they cannot stage press conferences or give Congressional testimony. Consequently, they► represent the path of least resistance for Representative Moffett and his colleagues. If historyis a guide, the National Alliance of the Short-cc-Time will soon appear.

FRANK LEVY Senior Research Associate The Urban Institute Washington, June 8, 1979 City Hospitals And the Church To the Editor: Your May 25 editorial “Abortion, the City and the Church” ignores the evidence. You say that a “contingency plan to hire outside physicians to perform abortions” in church‐run munici‐, pal hospitals should be tested. Our members have seen abortions virtually eliminated at Lincoln Hospital since Misercordia — an Archdiocese hospital — was given an affiliation contract. Any public hospital must serve the community equally. All services should be provided with dignity for patients. Reproductive services, including birth control and abortion, are basic parts of the primary care city hospitals provide. To limit or impede the delivery of these services Is obviously discriminatory to women. In this case there is a particular assault on Hispanic women, for whom Lincoln and Metropolitan are the most important hospitals. We condemn the current denial of services at Lincoln Hospital and the proposed extention of this illegal practice to Metropolitan. JONATHAN HOUSE, M.D. SANDY TURNER, M.D. JOHN BAUERS.

Prevailing‐Wage Law Worth Preserving To the Editor: I find the May 30 letter headed “Construction Workers in Fear of Competition” self‐serving and a continuance of a campaign of exploitive practices by unscrupulous contractors. I salute our Secretary of Labor, Ray Marshall, in his efforts to maintain the Davis‐Bacon Act. The opponents of the act are using the guise of inflation to repeal this outstanding piece of legislation. The purpose of the Davis‐Bacon Act and Section 220 of the New York State Labor Law is to establish a prevailing rate in geographical locations. The Davis‐Bacon Act was put into law in 1931 and signed by a Republican President, Herbert Hoover, during our country's worst recession. Representative Bacon of Long !gland was successful in obtaining desperately needed Federal funds for a post office in the area he represented. The contract was awarded to the lowest bidder, who was from Alabama. This Alabama general contractor did not employ the unemployed construction workers from Long Island but brought with him unemployed sharecroppers from Alabama to build the post office. Upon completion of this project, the contractor laid off his sharecroppers and left them as recipients of welfare on Long Island. Representative Bacon, Senator Davis apd President Hoover realized the variables in the geographical standard of living and pursued and established a prevailing‐wage law. If the Davis‐Bacon Act is repealed, then the next step will be to eliminate• the minimum‐wage laws and then the child‐labor laws. Our nation will go back to the Dark Ages. STANLEY SMITH President, Independent Electrical Contractors Association New York, June 5, 1979 With Regret To the Editor: Regretfully one must note that, regrettably, we've begun to say “regret. fully” when we mean “rearettablv.” P. M. O'Connor Delmar, N.Y., June 8, 1979 The Day the Law Stopped the Music To the Editor One of the great pleasures of New York City is to walk along Fifth Avenue. On any sunny day, the street musicians fill the air with a blend of sound, enough to delight anyone but Kalman Seigel the most tone‐deaf. From the steel drums at the Plaza fountain to the flutes playing a Telemann duet on 56th Street, past a Mozart quartet on 55th, solo violinist on the next block, a jazz saxophone two blocks farther — truly a musical smorgasbord for the thousands of people who pass by. Last week, on the way to an errand, I passed three musicians, obviously students, playing in front of the Hallmark store. I stopped, joining quite few others, to enjoy their skill and surprising virtuosity, when a policeman came along and much to everyone' s dismay issued a summons and ordered the group away. I intervened, not only in behalf of the performers but also for myself and the others who had been enjoying the tree concert. I was told, cavalierly, that this is the law, and as an offlcer he was enforcing it. Two blocks away, on 59th Street, in broad daylight on any day of the year, hoods line the walls of Central Park, arrogantly selling everything from flesh to dope, openly flouting the law. On this same street, as on Lexington Avenue near the Waldorf, on lower Madison Avenue and on countless more infamous streets all over the city, prostitutes peddle themselves night and day. A more recent but ever ‐growing plague is the street vendors parked on every available highly trafficked corner and sidewalk, many selling obviously stolen goods, costing both taxpayers and honest merchants incalculable dollars. I'd like to think the reason this officer chose these players as his target was only laziness. The musicians, not being street‐wise, made easy prey for a bullying policeman. I'd like not to think that their summons was issued because they couldn't make a payoff, or because the city's coffers are so empty. The city would in effect steal money from a few nice kids who, in helping their own cause, brought so much pleasure to other people. I left the scene feeling as one would feel leaving the scene of a tragedy. felt sorry for the kids, sorry for myself, but sorriest for New York City. When the police are done clearing the streets of the musicians, the only sounds left to those of us who still enjoy walking will be the shouts of the hoodlums, “Hey Baby, want some fun? Buy some smokes? Need some snow?” The day the music dies will be a sad day for us all. ELAINE BEDELL New York, June 10, 1979 Danger in the Subways To the Editor: The latest tragedy of the young flutist/pianist whose hand was severed when she was pushed in front of a subway train (the fifth such victim this year) should convince the New York City Transit Authority of the necessity for more safety measures. Why not install railings along the edge of subway platforms, with openings wide enough for the subway car doorways? Trains could always stop at the same position, aligning the doors with the openings in the railings. Like the shelters erected to protect bus riders from the elements, safety railings should be provided as part of the city's responsibility to help protect subway commuters from repetition of these vicious assaults. JOHN W. CHAMBERS New York, June 9, 1979 A Record of Progress for Indonesia's Government To the Editor: The May 23 Op‐Ed article by Eqbal Ahmad, “Suharto vs. Indonesia,” seems to us to give your readers a distorted picture of a people and a nation which by most independent accounts has shown remarkable resiliency and dynamic growth. No Indonesian would deny that the nation faces tremendous problems, caused by its geographic and ethnic diversity, its population size, its food requirements and the requirements of any developing nation. But to say, as Mr. Ahmad does, that the Suharto Government has not addressed these problems is both untrue and unfair. In fact, Indonesia has made remarkable progress under the Suharto Government, as can be corroborated by any number of responsible sources and independent observers. Inflation, which exceeded 600 percent in 1965, was brought down to 6 percent in 1973, according to an April 5 press release by the Inter‐Governmental Group on Indonesia, representing the assessment of 19 nations, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Asian Development Bank and the U. N. Development Program. More broadly, Indonesia has completed two five‐year development plans — achieving economic and social development targets‐and is well into the third. Among the substantial accomplishments of these plans, which have bettered the lives of each and every Indonesian, is a reduction in the population growth rate from over percent per annum to under 2 percent in a five‐year period from 1971 to 1976. The population control program undertaken by the Government of Indonesia has been widely considered the most successful to date and a model for other developing countries. With a sustained annual growth rate of 8 percent in domestic production, high levels of savings and investment, increased levels of consumption at all income levels, greatly expanded social services, particularly in health care, and a high rate of employment growth, Indonesia is well on the way to solving its problems and creating a better life for all of its people. This record, again, has been corroborated by a variety of independent observers. That problems still exist attests to their magnitude and cannot fairly be considered a reflection on the Suharto Government, which has performed remarkably well by all reasonable standards. Mr. Ahmad's comments on human rights and East Timor unfortunately rely on inaccuracies and unsubstantiated allegations. For example, he cites a figure of 100,000 killed in East Timor, but that “statistic” has long since been refuted and, in fact, disavowed by its original source, the Australian James Dunn, in testimony before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs on March 23,1977. That Indonesia has made progress under the leadership of the Suharto. Government is on the record for all to see; that major problems still exist is a fact forthrightly stated by all persons in the Government; that specific policies and programs to deal with these problems are being studied and implemented is confirmed by the steady flow of people visiting and writing about Indonesia. We welcome a balanced look at Indonesia, our problems and our poten- tial. SAMSI ABDULLAH Head, Information Department Embassy of Indonesia Washington, May 31, 1979"
The Region,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/17/archives/the-region-in-summary-koch-identifies-his-targets-for-hospital.html,"After months of city‐state sidestep. ping over the closing of hospitals, Mayor Koch screwed his courage to the sticking place last week and named four municipal institutions that would have to shut down to save $40 million from the projected budget gap in 1981. He immediately ran into the expected barrage of protests, implic fitly accusing him of racism. “They'll close over our dead bodies,” said Councilman Frederick E. Samuel, a Harlem Democrat. The harsh fact is that all four hospitals are in minority neighborhoods: Metropolitan on First Avenue and 97th Street just south of Spanish Harlem in Manhattan, Sydenham in West Har lem, and Cumberland and Greenpoint in North Brooklyn. Now Governor Carey has to make his lang‐delayed move. Koch officials said they Would urge him to close 10 private ‘ and voluntary hospitals as part of a synchronized effort to eliminate= 3,000 underutilized beds. Both agree that municipal closings must be accompanied by voluntary hospital closings so that neighborhood care can be dovetailed and economized. Some of the voluntary hospitals on the Mayor's “hit list” to the Governor include Holy Family, Lutheran and Baptist Hospitals in Brooklyn, St. Elizabeth's and Jewish Memorial in Upper Manhattan, the Fulton Division of Lebanon in the Bronx and Terrace Heights Hospital in Queens. The Governor seems to have harder job with the voluntaries; which he can heavily influence through Medicaid payments, and that may be why Mr. Koch took the first step and can only be in a position of recommending for the next. For his part, the Mayor must cope with opposition from the union representing hospital workers, most of whom are members of minority groups themselves; from community groups that insist the redistributed care will work to their disadvantage, and from fellow politicians like Representative Charles B. Rangel, who charges abandonment of the “defenseless sick, poor, elderly and children.” Despite opposition from the Health and Hospitals Corporation, which last week voted to table any discussion of his budget because its members hadn't been consulted, the agency is expected to endorse the closings this week — reluctantlY. N.J. Tightens Abortion Rules New Jersey legislators, under pres sure from constituents, are making abortions more expensive, harder to get and requiring that doctors recommend applicants to consult agencies that will encourage pregnant women to carry their children to full term. Further, a bill, which passed the State Assembly last week, 51‐17, and is now before the Senate, would make it a criminal offense — up to 10 years in prison — for anyone to take the life of an infant who is aborted while still alive. The bill would more than double the average fee of $350 for abortions in clinics or doctors’ offices by requiring that virtually all, be performed in hospitals. It also orders physicians to obtain each woman's written consent and then wait 48 hours before performing the operation. Did Pullman Pull a Sleeper? “At any moment there could be a derailment,” a retired Pullman Inc. executive named Walter V. Berry said last week. “People could get killed.” His words were one reason Mayor Koch announced that 109 subway cars Transit Authority official points to repaired hole on a R‐48 truck. were being pulled out of service for repairs and inspections. Mr. Berry was not alone in blowing the train whistle. In a series of articles ..in The New York Times, he and a former associate at Pullman charged that at least one Transit Authority official responsible for inspecting the 754 R‐46 cars Pullman built under a $208.5 million contract had been bribed by employees of Pullman to accept “substandard” cars. Some flaws began showing up quickly, authorities say. The first cracked truck — the cast‐steel assembly that carries a car's wheels, motors and brakes — was discovered in March 1977, city reports say, after a motor dropped onto an axle. M of last week, 1,058 cracks had been discovered in 618 trucks. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and° the city's Investigation ‘Department began looking into the bribery charges. Pullman and the Transit Authority denied any wrongdoing. Last week, the Mayor also announced that the city had filed a $112.3 million lawsuit against the the manufacturers of the cars for breach of contract and warranty. The city's suit maintained that the trucks had been “dangerously underdesigned.” Transit Authority officials were criticized for initially agreeing to accept late‐delivery penalties that could have been much larger and for going along with an unsatisfactory repairs program. A Failing Mark For Schools Suit Unfortunately, somebody will have to read this to Edward Donohue: You lost. The New. York State Court of Appeals last week upheld two lower courts that dismissed Mr. Donohue's lawsuit charging the Copiague Union Free School District on Long Island with “educational malpractice.” Mr. Donohue, who graduated from high school in 1976, claimed he was unable to read even a restaurant menu and that his miseducation had left him unemployable and “unable to cope properly with the affairs of the world.” The Court of Appeals, the state's highest, said courts should avoid making judgments in such suits as “a matter of public policy.” Several similar suits have been filed in the last several years around the country, but the Donohue suit is the first to reach a court as high as the Court of Appeals. Because of the court's prestige, its decision is likely to be influential in deciding the other cases. Suffolk's Troubles Undermining Klein “He's always supported me, but don't know how to reach .him anymore,” said a bewildered John V. N. Klein, the Suffolk County Executive, after he narrowly won renomination last week during a raucous, all‐night convention of the county's Republicans. The “he” to whom Mr. Klein referred was Peter Fox Cohalan, the Islip town supervisor who, at the urging of disaffected county Republican leaders, had made an eleventh‐hour bld to wrest the nomination from Mr. Klein• at the convention, where emotions ran so high that a fistfight broke out in one delegation. The same remark could have applied to dozens of others in the Suffolk G.O.P. In recent months, Mr. Klein, who once was considered a shoo‐in for re‐election, has collected political liabilities as he once collected commitments. His friend and political men‐, tor, Nicholas Barbato, was indicted for extortion and grand larceny in connection with county business. The Southwest Sewer District scandal grew; Mr. Klein's attempt to defuse it by accepting political reponsibility loudly backfired; and last week's unruly convention was only the first organized'echo. ‘Gray Power’ Votes Defeat School Tax Perhaps more than any other institution, America's public school systems are a gauge of the strength or weakness of the social contract. Citizens are called on to support the schools, whether or not they have a personal stake in them. In the western Connecticut town of Southbury, the social contract is under strain in a situation that may presage similar developments in more and more communities as the “graying of America” continues. In three referendums in the last six weeks, residents of Heritage Village, so‐called retirement community in Southbury, have provided the votes to defeat the proposed school budget for next year. Early in the budget battle, the Heritage Village Civic Association published a flier noting that village residents, who include no school‐age children, paid $1.5 million in school taxes “without having any children participating in the educational program.” The Southbury‐Middlebury regional school district has roughly 3,000 students and is growing. The school board met last week and pared another $12,500 from the proposed budget, which started out at $7.4 million and was cut to $7.3 million after the second referendum. The new proposal will be presented Wednesday at a town meeting where, it is hoped, it will receive enough popular support to avoid a fourth referendum. Alvin Davis and Don Wycliff"
‘Loose Ends’,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/17/archives/stage-view-loose-ends-is-fascinating.html,"STAGE VIEW Michael Weller's “Loose Ends” has just opened at Circle in the Square and, on almost all counts, it's fascinating. But first we must go back a step. There came a time in our lives, an indeter- mate time but let's say the early 1960's, when all the rules just blew away, like seckel‐pear blossoms in a rainstorm: rules about boys and girls sleeping together, rules about being polite to strangers, rules about marital infidelity, rules about pretending to love your mother, rules about aborting babies, rules about who runs the household and no backtalk, rules about not poking fun at the rules. For awhile the whole glorious sad‐funny freedom was exhilarating: was wonderful not having to lie about anything, wonderful being able to lie a blue streak about everything. In a definitive play called “Moonchildren,” playwright Weller pinned down the utter hilarity of total disbelief in the good, the• true, the prefabricated beautiful. He also let us hear, underneath the inventive mockery, a melancholy strain. It was almost as though we'd caught one of his youngsters alone for minute, biting at a hangnail with surprising savagery. For hangnails persist, even when you have no hangups. Implicit in the ending of “Moonchildren” was the notion that somewhere, around the next corner after college, there was an apparently stupid life to be got through. And if you weren't going to lead it as stupidly as the old rules had wanted you to, you would be faced with a possibly intolerable chore. You were going to have to decide every single move you made freshly, independently, and for 24 hours day. The ready‐made life of the Boy Scout oath was dead. You were going to have to live a life of infinite choice. Which is not so much the subject matter as the specific dimension of Mr. Weller's engrossing new play. “Loose Ends,” which I commend to you here and now while reserving the right to quibble a bit later on, would scarcely provide material for a play if an earlier structured world, with its gift‐wrapped guides to conduct, hadn't been reduced to shambles. What's it about? A boy and a girl fall in love (romantically, on the sands of Bali). In time they marry and are even happy together (making due allowance for quite customary spats). In greater time they are driven apart by career problems (perhaps a shade of something new there, given feminine liberation, but keep in mind that “A Star Is Born” wasn't born yesterday). What's new? What's worth intensive investigation? • • All of it, because the earth's turned turtle. Mr. Weller. picks up, in that very first scene, the tone of voice in which “Moonchildren” reveled. Yes, the scene is romantic, as the quick attraction between boy and girl is genuinely felt. Yet the skeptical eye of a generation that went to school so profitlessly a few years earlier is still sharply, playfully at work. Kevin Kline, wonderfully mercurial as the would‐be teacher, isn't in Bali for the moonlight, cruise‐conducted. He's there because he's finished a two‐year stint in the Peace Corps, where sanity did not especially reign. Mr. Kline is immensely funny (in his author's god-help-us-all way) as he describes a health program he and a friend have efficiently devised, using the whole of their savings for the necessary medication. When the medicines never arrive, he corners a superior, only to be contemptuously informed that the supplies are not going to arrive. Of course he can save local lives, he is told. But is he prepared to support the people he saves for the next 10 years? A calculated obsolescence involving death is at work here, and the irony inside it — the preposterousness of being kept from doing too much good is as cutting as Mr. Kline's account of it is cool. Neither he nor the friends he visits at home now and again want to “lose As Mr. Kline and his light and lively auburn‐haired companion, Roxanne Hart, return to the States, she comes to think marriage might prove practical enough. Though she's mentioned it five times, she confides to an acquaintance, he always says yes and never does anything about it. Not too long after, Mr. Kline, rocking in resolute and selfcontained rhythm on a garden swing, admits to his vastly successful, relentlessly jovial elder brother that they have, in fact, married. Asked by the now outraged brother why he hasn't so much as mentioned the fact to their ‐mother, Mr. Kline's buried angers erupt for once. In a fiercely telling tirade, he makes it plain that “marriage” means only what he permits it to mean, not what it means to a mother who bleeds her husband dry in alimony and pours the loot into meaningless boutique. Nor will he have any part of his brother's opulent way of life. He wants neither money nor a career, only what he “can see and touch,” a woman, a house, a child. The lines are read incisively, with such intellectual intensity and wit that cliché is driven from them. Mr. Kline has fought his way through every step that might bring him closer to convention, has had to define and redefine the commonplace words that might entrap him. He is, really, a closet idealist, but one who must justify to himself each gesture, each commitment he makes, each aspiration he acknowledges. There is heat in the process, because so much energy is spent; but humor is always scurrying to the rescue. The actor's timing is so impeccable that he can arrive at one firmly outlined conclusion and then, after a single suspenseful beat, draw a deeply satisfying laugh by adding an equally firm “Primari- ly.” You know that the self‐questioning is beginning all over again. While little rifts are beginning to scar the relationship, the play bubbles along — for the most part — on interim meetings with old chums. Jay 0. Sanders, as a husband and father who has cunningly kept his detachment intact, and Celia Weston, pregnant with a third child she admits is “mistake” (while cautioning the one in her arms that she doesn't mean it) make a dandy couple to drop in on. Jodi Long, attractively cynical as an assistant to Mr. Kline in his minor‐league filmmaking, fixes a knowing eye on the partners as they begin to indulge in rationalizations and bluntly refuses to play “middle man” in their personal lives. Your decision, your decision, echoes through the play's every inch. Not every inch is necessary. The evening can easily take 'some pruning. I don't think we really need to know that one acquaintance has gone to India and returned with robed guru in tow, a guru whose vocabulary consists mainly of the word “Yes” and simultaneously upthrust palms. We remember the kookiness that the moonchildren embraced; there are already traces of it here in Miss Weston's instant cure for depressions (she asks herself, “Well, how bad can be if there's still sex?”). Though Michael Lipton is fine rattling off an express‐train monologue, it's scarcely worth an entire scene to inform us that our girl's employer is gay. The author's most serious miscalculation, though, cornea with our return to the loving but liberated private lives of the two princi- pals. Miss Hart has stumbled into successful career as a photographer, in New York; Mr. Kline's work keeps him in Boston, a city he also happens to prefer. What's affection worth? The surrender of a job, of a congenial envi- ronment? It's got to be thought through, as honorably as possible and - if possible — without compromise. “Deals” are distasteful. Love can't be love if it limits either party's options. Thus far Mr. Weller has carried us through his precise reflection of what's going on around us with perception, restrained passion, a lighthearted decency‐playing fair with both contenders. Then, in the process of avoiding the commitments and the rather degrad. ing bargaining of a “deal,” the youngsters — no longer quite so young — arrive at a sort of trust-to-chance arrangement. Mr. Kline's been wanting to have a child; she, at 32 and enjoying her work, resists the notion. Mr. Kline offers to join her in New York, without stipulation; she offers, spontaneously, to do nothing to interfere with the conception of a child. The relationship survives the threat of separate cities, separate professions. Under the new decorated‐penthouse dispensation, Mr. Kline becomes — hilariously, for a time — a self‐mocking carbon copy of the coast-to-coast filmmaker: white suit, cropped hair, tinted glasses, missing plane tickets. While he is away, Miss Hart discovers she has become pregnant, and, after a most tentative soul‐struggle, has an abortion without telling him anything at all. With this, and much to our shock, we find all sympathy for the girl abruptly washed away. For she's cheated by herown standards. An offer freely made has been furtively withdrawn; the very silence is a lie. In a relationship built on fairness, she hasn't played fair, and the self‐betrayal hurts. Oddly, it hurts us: we don't like our own rejection of a girl we've liked so much. I realize that Mr. Weller may not have miscalculated his effect. He may well have wished human nature — unchangeable, irredeemably flawed — to intrude upon the most candid, the most considerate, the most fair‐minded of newly minted worlds. And the crisis does give Mr. Kline the opportunity to play two more striking scenes: one scathingly violent, one charmingly conciliatory if ultimately futile. Musing, in’ his final loneliness, on such concepts as “respect” and “trust,” Mr. Kline murmurs, “Funny how it comes back to words like that.” Perhaps Mr. Weller's own candor has compelled him to look uncertainty straight in the face again, to take us back to where the “Moonchildren” were before they managed to invent their own demanding code. In any event, and allowing for our surprise at finding ourselves — in a play of this kind — ultimately aligned with one partner rather than another, “Loose Ends” is the richly entertain‐. ing, always provocative work of one of our finest new playwrights. The voice is original and director Alan Schneider has made certain that we can hear its nuances, one by one."
The Courage to Be Utterly Selfish,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/17/archives/the-courage-to-be-utterly-selfish.html,"IT is fashionable nowadays in medical as well as literary circles to deny the existence of nymphomania as a condition and to treat the word “nymphomaniac” as little more than a term of sexist abuse, there being no exactly equivalent word for the compulsively promiscuous priapic male. Perhaps this is cor NANCY CUNARD By Anne Chisholm. Illustrated. 366 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $15. rect, and Nancy Cunard was singular in showing all the symptoms and responses generally attributed to this nonexistent class of women. But whatever label we choose to attach to her, there can be no doubt that in plain, nonpsychological terms, the rebellious Eng- lish poet and avant‐garde publisher, Nancy Cunard, was an appalling mess. She was born in March 1896, the only child of a rich, dim English baronet of American background, and a California heiress, Maud Burke, who changed her first name to Emerald when she later took her place as one of the great ladies of London society. It is sometimes thought that her real father was Geoige Moore, the Irish novelist, who enjoyed a certain vogue at the time. By the time Nancy grew up, her parents were separated — Sir Bache Cunard living in his vast man- sion and 13,000 acres in Leicestershire, Lady Cunard at 44 Grosvenor Square, where she could be close to her lover, Sir Thomas Beecham, the conductor. Nancy, an only child, plainly resented this arrange- ment, but not nearly so much as she resented the so- cial and financial dependence on her mother. Anne Chisholm, a British journalist, in the course of her ex- cellently written and compulsively readable biogra- phy, makes a strong case for supposing that it was this resentment — the only grain of sand in the world-oys- ter of a spoiled, rich, willful little madame — that ac- counts for everything: her inability to sustain a rela- tionship, her nymphomania, her adoption of the black cause, her left‐wing politics and finally her dipsoma- nia, drug history, insanity and lonely death in the pub- lic ward of a Paris hospital. If so, ‘the moral to be drawn from her sorry tale is that rich mothers should settle money on their children rather than leave them dependent. But I do not wish to put words in Miss Chi- sholm's mouth. She has far more sympathy for her subject than I have, and even, at moments, seems to see her as a quasi‐heroic figure, or at any rate a tragic victim of her age and upbringing. Miss Chisholm suggests that it was largely to annoy her mother that Nancy took up with the black Ameri- can musician Henry Crowder in 1928. If so, one can only say she succeeded. One suspects that her earlier involvement with Louis Aragon, the French Commu- nist, was similarly inspired. Her later involvement with the black cause in America br6ught her close, once again, to the Communist Party, which was com- peting for black support with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Neither fac- tion was particularly impressed by her anthology “Negro,” which remains, nevertheless, a curious but unmistakable milestone in black American history. Auberon Waugh is the author of three works of non- fiction and five novels including “Foxglove Saga” and “Path of Dalliance.” He is chief fiction reviewer for The London Evening Standard and a columnist for The Spectator and Books and Bookmen. Although Nancy never became a Communist, she de- cided from the late 1920's on that the Communist side was the right one to be on. Her reason for this choice and Miss Chisholm makes no bones about this — was to strike out against her mother and her mother's world. As Miss Chisholm says: “To associate with Communists, to have a Communist party member for her lover, and to espouse Communist ideas was a won- derful tease for her mother.” Photograph by Cecil Beaton Nancy Cunard, 1930. Before the affair with Crowder, which turned out to be the crucial relationship of her life and brought about the final break with her mother, Nancy had been briefly married to a young Australian soldier, Sydney Fairbairn. Later she was to attribute the failure of this marriage to her own artistic temperament, complain- ing of her husband's conventional interests, but Miss Chisholm suspects it may have been because of sexual incompatibility. Shortly after the marriage she suffered some gynecological trouble in the winter of 1920, which re- suited in a hysterectomy, followed by a third operation against peritonitis and gangrene. I can't make out from Miss Chisholm's account whether the trouble started with a botched abortion or a botched sterilization- “curettage” might cover either. One can't really judge how this affected her sexual life, which was to play such a large part in her undoing, but I suspect it begins to explain Miss Chisholm's sympathy for her. Raymond Michelet, the only one Nancy's lovers who was prepared to discuss this aspect with Miss Chisholm, says she found orgasm difficult but not impossible. Others close to her suggest that she was probably frigid most of the time. Of the various men whom Miss Chisholm wheels out to testify to her sexual attraction, I find it significant that most are elderly bachelors with no great history of involvement with the opposite sex: Raymond Mortimer, Sir Harold Acton and so on. Whatever quality it was that got men into bed with her is not caught by the photographs that survive, least of all by Cecil Beaton's famous study on the jacket: With bangles from wrist to shoulder, short hair and wild, staring eyes, she looks hideous as well as mad — the sort of woman normal man would run from. A partial explanation for the fact that she still can excite Miss Chisholm's devotion may be found in her conduct during the Spanish Civil War. Unlike so many others who felt themselves involved in the Communist cause, she actually went to Spain, in addition to editing the famous “Authors Take Sides,” precursor of all those pompous round‐robins from literary folk on moral and political topics of the day. Confronted with the somewhat tendentious question “Are you for, or against, the legal government and the People of Republican Spain? Are you for, or against, Franco or Fascism?” only five out of 148 respondents produced the wrong answer, and only one of these — Evelyn Waugh‐objected to the wording. Nancy survives as Iris March in Michael Arlen's “The Green Hat” — a book practically nobody reads nowadays, but once upon a time Greta Garbo played the role. She is also to be found as Myra Viveash in Aldous Huxley's “Antic Hay.” I can't help wondering whether some rumor of her relationship with Crowder had not reached Waugh's ears in time for it to be included in his description of Mrs. Beste‐Chetwynde's relationship with Chokey in “Decline and Fall,” which also appeared in 1928: “'My race,’ said Chokey, ‘is essentially an artistic race. We have the child's love of song and colour and the child's natural good taste. All you white folks despise the poor coloured man. . . .9 “'No, no,’ said the Doctor. “'Let him say his piece, the darling,’ said Mrs. Beste‐Chetwynde. ‘Isn't he divine?’ “ At the age of 64, on her last visit to England, the picture was rather different. Aggressive, violent, incoherent, drinking .constantly, she roamed London insulting policemen and making sexual propositions strangers. Arrested for soliciting in the King's. Road, she was eventually committed to an asylum. She was tormented in her last days by fears of persecution by the police. I suspect that the real reason she is held up for our pity and even our admiration has nothing to do with politics. Like the absurd and repulsive Lady Caroline Lamb — another spoiled rich woman Nancy Cunard had the courage to be utterly selfish.

Woman in Steel: Drive for Equality,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/18/archives/woman-in-steel-drive-for-equality-court-ordered-that-she-be-hired.html,"CHICAGO, June 14 —Alice Peurala has been fighting with her supervisors at the United States Steel Corporation's South Works plant here since she became convinced that women employees were being relegated to dead‐end lobs. “When I was hired as a metallurgical observer 26 years ago they told me it was a good job for women and that men did not seem to stay in the position long,” Mrs. Peurala recalled in an interview. “I began to see many of the men I had trained get promoted to better jobs while the women went nowhere. Then I got mad.” The 51‐year‐old maverick is still angry and is still fighting with her supervisors but now, as the newly elected president of Steelworkers Local 65 she is believed to be the first woman to head a major steelworkers’ unit. Local 65, the second largest steelworkers’ local in Illinois, has about 8,000 members, of whom about 500 are women. covers a one‐mile‐long stretch of mills, furnaces and worksheds along Lake Michigan near the Indiana state line. Mrs. Peurala defeated two other candidates by 37 votes on a platform.to work toward democratizing the United Steelworkers of America, reactivating and strengthening civil rights efforts and improving plant safety and job security. Mrs. Peurala's reputation as a fighter began in 1967, when she filed sex discrimination charges against United States Steel under Title VU of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. She accused the company of denying her a chance for promotion solely because she was a woman. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, after two‐year investigation, found that she had probable cause but United States Steel refused to conciliate the matter. Mrs. Peurala filed an action in Federal court and, in an outof‐court settlement, the company promised that she would be assigned the next job opening as a product tester. “I later learned that they were using supervisors to do the job rather than give it to me and I went back to court and the judge ordered me hired,” she said. “The job involved inspecting large pieces of metal make sure they conformed to the customer's specifications, and it seemed that I always got the most work and the hardest part of the job—lifting the heavy metal pieces, while the men I worked with simply kept a written log,” she said. “Finally I told them I would keep the log and that they could do some of the lifting.” Mrs. Peurala began her union activities in 1969, dissatisfied with the union because, she says, it had not helped her her fight for equal status with men. In 1970 she ran for recording secretary and lost. She lost second bid for the same job after the man who defeated her quit the post after a few months. In 1973 she ran for another union post and lost by seven votes. These bids were made before she was made a product tester under the court order in 1974, a job that took her throughout the 10 divisions of Local 65 and placed her in contact with hundreds of other workers. At union meetings she gained more recognition by introducing a number of controversial resolutions that, for example, advocated the right of the locals to vote on ratification the its labor contract, opposed the Cambodia invasion by United States military forces, supported abortion rights and supported the proposed equal rights amendment. In office less than two months, Mrs. Peurala has not yet had any real battles with United States Steel. She said she thought it likely that the first would be over worker safety. “The Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined the company thousands of dollars for health violations in our foundry after it was found that 33 workers had developed silicosis,” she said. “Now the company wants to close the foundry rather than improve it, which will mean the loss of about 200 jobs. To us, management is saying that if you dare to complain about conditions you will be out of a job.” The New York Times /Don Hogan Charles"
EDUCATION City Weighs More Explicit Sex Education,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/19/archives/education-city-weighs-more-explicit-sex-education-city-studies.html,"IN an effort to curb teen‐age pregnancies and be more responsive to student needs, Board of Education officials have prepared a new curriculum that would permit far more explicit instruction in sex‐education classes in New York City's public schools. The proposal, which would be the first official revision of the “family living” curriculum in 10 years, would authorize teachers for the first time to speak explicitly about such previously forbidden subjects as birth control, masturbation, homosexuality and abortion. Under the proposal, students could, for example, learn about methods of contraception as early as the fifth grade. “The times are changing, the life styles are changing,” said Mel Warren, the board's assistant director of health services. “We are responding to the needs of youngsters.” In the current curriculum, which is based on a 119‐page manual that was written in 1969, the female and male reproductive systems are discussed in anatomical detail but, according to those preparing the new curriculum, many important areas of sex education are avoided or not frankly discussed. Faced with an increasing number of pregnancies, rapes and cases of venereal disease among teen‐agers, the board's Health Division has sought to change the substance and format of the curriculum. “The key change is getting kids involved in the decisionmaking process,” Mr. Warren said. “Not that we want to encourage premarital sex. But what we want to do is set up a forum where this can be intelligently discussed.” The new curriculum, which is still in draft form and is subject to the approval of both the Chancellor of Schools, Frank J. Macchiarola, and the board, would authorize but not compel sex education. It would serve as a general blueprint from which school districts could select what they be‐ lieved to be appropriate segments for specific youngsters. Some suggested areas include: ¶In kindergarten through second grade, youngsters would learn that all living things come from other living things. They would be shown diagrams of an egg and a sperm and discuss how parents prepare fora baby's birth. ¶In third and fourth grades, children would first learn about the reproductive system. ¶In the fifth and sixth grades, youngsters would learn about heredity, the influence of hormones on the body, nocturnal emissions, masturbation, menstruation, the interaction of the parts of the reproductive system during conception and the methods of contraception. One suggested topic for discussion would be: “Even though an individual's reproductive system may be physically mature, they may not be ready for intercourse because they may be emotionally immature.” ¶In grades seven through nine, students would learn about changes in the American family and the ways of life of single parents, people who are divorced, widows and adolescent parents. There would also be discussions of homosexuality and an explanation of the various methods of abortion. For grades 10 through 12, students would discuss what constitutes “being. ready” for marriage or children. They also would learn about types of childbirth, stages of labor and infant care. Currently, schools are authorizedbut not required to teach sex education. In some schools, the subject is taught as part of the “hygiene” or “family living” curriculums. In others it is not taught at all. According to the board, I.S. 54 at 103 West 107th Street offers one of the most complete sex education courses in the city. A recent visit there, however, showed that misunderstandings abound among students. Some said they believed that a girl could notbe come pregnant the first time she had intercourse. Others said they belieVgl pregruincy could be avoided if a girl had intercourse every day. Still other said they thought a girl could becdnie pregnant through kissing. “The kids are ignorant,” said Michael Grossman, assistant principatin charge of health. Not only is there a need for a new curriculum, he added, but there is also a need for training teachers: “The teachers are technically knowledgeable, but they're lecturing about tubes and openings.” The New York Times/Neal Boenzi Roberto Sein follows a sex education lesson at Booker T. Washington Junior High School on West 107th Street in Manhattan."
Private Study Attributes Sheep Deaths to Fallout of ‘53 Atomic Tests,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/19/archives/private-study-attributes-sheep-deaths-to-fallout-of-53-atomic-tests.html,"WASHINGTON June 18 — The deaths of thousands of sheep after a series of atomic tests in the spring of 1953 can definitely be attributed to nuclear fallout, according to a private report that for the first time makes a direct scientific link between the deaths and radiation. The report also said that some of the dead sheep had been grazing in areas 1where the reported fallout was within the safety levels that had been set by the Atomic Energy Commission. The study on the deaths of the sheep was conducted by Dr. Harold A. Knapp. In 1962, when he was with the commission's Fallout Studies Branch, he wrote a highly controversial study that was the first to suggest that some children in communities near the Nevada Testing Site had received large amounts of radioactive Iodine‐131 that affected their thyroids. Dr. Knapp's current study comes at time whpn ranchers plan to go back into court to fight for reparations from the Government, a battle they lost in 1956 when the court ruled that they had not been able to establish a connection between the deaths and fallout. “Based on information I've received about the report, this is what we've been waiting for,” said Dan. S. Bushnell, the sheepmen's attorney. The report was also greeted enthusiastically by Stewart L. Udall, the attorney leading a class‐action lawsuit against the Government on behalf of people in Nevada, Arizona and Utah. “Dr. Knapp's methodology would also apply with equal ‘force to an analysis of the internal dose to human beings,” he said. The 55‐page report was researched and written privately by Dr. Knapp. It was released by Representative Gunn McKay, Democrat of Utah, who said that it provided the first direct evidence that the Federal Government should accept liability for the sheep deaths. After working on the problem for a few weeks, he got in touch with Senhtor Edward M. Kennedy, chairman of a Senate health subcommittee; Representative Bob Eckhardt, chairman of the House Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, and Scott M. Matheson, Governor of Utah. The final report, which is not yet out, will be prepared for them. In the conclusion of his report, Dr. Knapp stated: “The unusual and unexplained deaths of thousands of sheep in areas downwind of the Nevada Test Site in the spring of 1953 can be attributed to the fallout from two nuclear tests. “The simplest explanation of the primary cause of death, not considered at the time, is irradiation of the sheep's gastrointestinal tract by all the fission products present in the fallout particles which were ingested along with open‐range forage.” Approximately 4,200 sheep, which had been wintering 50 miles northeast of the site where the atomic weapons were tested, died that spring. The possible radiation symptoms began appearing in March. There were spontaneous abortions, lambs were stunted at birth and many had lesions consistent with radiation burns found in cattle tested in earlier atomic shots. At the trial of the claim brought by the sheepmen in 1956, Government scientists maintained that the sheep had died of natural causes."
A Summary of the Actions Taken This Year by the New York State Legislature,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/21/archives/a-summary-of-the-actions-taken-this-year-by-the-new-york-state.html,"ALBANY, June 20 — Following are some of the major actions taken by the New York State Legislature during the 1979 session, which recessed last Sunday morning: Criminal Justice and Courts PASSED Restoring the death penalty for certain “intentional murders,” including the murder of a police officer and a murder committed during a rape or robbery. This bill faces certain gubernatorial veto. Relaxing penalties for first‐time ,Offenders under the so‐called Rockefeller drug laws, allowing for resentencing of 1 most of those sentenced under the old laws, and stiffening penalties for repeating offenders and for the sale and possession of “angel dust.” Limiting the Marijuana Reform Act by changing the “pure” weight requirement* for conviction to “aggregate” weight, thereby making prosecutions easier. Enabling the state to take over the’ Bikers Island prison complex under ,a lease arrangement with New York City. Expanding the rights of defendants during “pretrial discovery” proceedings to enable them to find out more about the evidence against them. Relaxing the 1968 Juvenile Offender Law by taking jurisdiction away from the adult courts in some cases and returning the cases to the Family Courts. Establishing penalties for hazing or any other dangerous initiation practices of a college fraternity. Expanding the list of relatives whose deathbeds or funerals inmates may be given permission to visit to include grandparents, grandchildren, uncles and aunts. Increasing to $1,000 from $500 the limit on damages for which parents can be held liable when acts of vandalism of private drenproperty are committed by their chil- Raising the crime of making a false bomb threat from a Class B to a Class A misdemeanor. Repealing a law that required political party leaders to resign if they refused to testify before a grand jury. Requiring that the name of a victim in a rape case be left out of the public record if the victim is 18 years old or younger. Creating an Office of Fire Prevention and Control to train arson investigators. Merging the Long Island state parkway police with the state police. Enabling uncontested candidates for Civil Court vacancies in New York City to- avoid being listed on the primary ballot. Expanding the powers of the Crime Victims Compensation Board. Allowing the Crime Victims Compensation Board to pay for examinations for victims of sex offenses. Delaying for two years the establishment of a Housing Authority police fingerprinting and booking center. Expanding the powers of New York City marshals. KILLED Enabling the New’ York City Transit Authority police to set up a “fourth platoon,” rather than the current threetour system required in most of the state. Raising the legal drinking age from 18 to 21. Imposing a $250 penalty on those convicted of violent crimes to aid a fund for victims. Banning corporal punishment in schools. Increasing to $100 from $10 the penalty for a minor who purchases alcholic beverages. Imposing 100 percent liability on parents of children who commit acts of vandalism against religious institutions. Allowing juries to find defendants “guilty but mentally ill,” thus requiring psychiatric treatment in prison. VETOED Making it a misdemeanor for a store or hotel to use a two‐way mirror to watch patrons. Requiring courts to place on the record any plea‐bargaining arrangements. Removing legal restrictions that forbid police officers from joining political clubs. Finance Restrained by dire warnings of a possible deficit next year, the Legislature approved a $12.8 billion budget largely within the bounds outlined by Governor Carey. As usual, it scrapped Mr. Carey's plan to shift money to poor school districts at the expense of wealthy ones, putting into effect an increase of $186 million in general aid to public schools — slightly less than the Governor requested — with less aid to poor districts than Mr. Carey sought and protections against wealthy districts losing any money. This was later supplemented with $58 million aimed more specifically at poor districts. Also included was a new formula for general revenue sharing for local governments, which would slow the growth in aid in the future by attaching it to the entire tax base, rather than the more rapidly inflating personal‐income tax, as is now the case. Traditionally liberal programs did poorly in the budget. Attempts to get an increase in aid for welfare recipients foundered, although an increase for the elderly, blind and disabled was enacted later in the year. Efforts to hold down tuition in the State University system failed, as did a Carey proposal for a druginsurance program for the elderly. The budget, as last year, was snarled in a dispute over whether the state should continue to finance abortions for poor women under the Medicaid program, with the Senate favoring a cutoff of the funds and the Assembly resisting it. The Assembly position prevailed as support for the cutoff eroded in the face of an upcoming legislative recess and warnings that further delays could adversely affect the state's financial position. As passed in April, the budget contained a $300 million tax‐refund reserve, which would allow the state to cope with slower growth next year as the tax cuts of the last few years take effect. As the session ended, the Legislature began to believe there was even more money there and spent part of it in a • $145 million supplemental budget. Banking and Insurance PASSED Lowering insurance rates for persons who are in the state's high‐risk homeinsurance pool because of the neighborhoods in which they live. These insurance customers would pay rates no more than .40 percent above regular market rates, with small businesses and homeowners paying no more than 20 percent higher than regular rates. Making it easier for insurers to cancel auto insurance for a certain number of customers annually.

KILLED Requiring banks to tell customers how checking‐account charges work and making the banks adhere to uniform standards on such accounts. Limiting takeovers of New York banks by foreign interests. Raising minimum insurance requirements for drivers to $50,000’ for single deaths and $100,000 for multiple deaths. Minimums are now $10,000 and $20,000, respectively. Requiring that insurance contracts be written in nontechnical language. Providing for the election of savingsbank trustees by depositors.

TV Weekend Abortion Debate and a New Drama,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/22/archives/tv-weekend-abortion-debate-and-a-new-drama.html,"SUMMER is upon us, and therefore, so is a season of reruns. Efforts must be made to find the new and unusual. At least three choice specimens are available this weekend — two on television, the third on radio. At 10 P.M. on Sunday, Channel 13 will carry “Abortion: Right to Life Versus Right to Choose.” This 90‐minute “live documentary” is being produced by the Public Interest Video Network, the same group that several weeks ago, organized the three‐hour coverage of Washington's anti-nuclear-energy rally. On this occasion, the broadcast will cover both sides of the incendiary issue of abortion. Originating from Cincinnati, the program will contain excerpts from an annual Right to Life Convention and a counter‐event called Freedom of Choice Week. • On radio, specifically on WNBC‐AM, at approximately 11 P.M. on Sunday, there is “A Summer Radio Picnic With the Kraft Family,” a spinoff from last year's “Kraft's Family Reunion.” With Eddy Arnold and Ed Herlihy as hosts in a somewhat hokey format, the program plucks highlights from Kraft Cheese programs of the 1930's and 40's — most of them overseen by Bing Crosby. For anyone who grew up in those decades, the memories will be stunning. For those who didn't, the range of radio entertainment should prove startling. There is Charles Boyer singing in thick French accent “Home on the Range.” There is Crosby and Mary Martin breaking up while singing the silly lyric of “Rose O'Day.” There is Jimmy Durante expounding on the heldentenor Lauritz Melchior (he pronounces it Mell-ik-cure) and then offering his own high note (“The last time I sang that note, they thought Dr. I. Q. had a lady in the balcony”). Larry Adler plays the harmonica. Nat (King) Cole sings. And what was the name of the group that recorded “Cement Mixer — Putty, Putty?” Tune in for the fascinating answer. • Back on television, ABC‐TV is offering Sunday at 9 P.M., an ABC Theater production called “Hollow Image.” To begin with, this film is of interest because its writer, Lee Hunkins, was the winner of the 1979 ABC Theater Award for the best original script at the Eugene O'Neill National Playwrights Con- ference, which is convened each year in Waterford, Conn., under the aegis of Lloyd Richards. Beyond that level of establishment credentials, “Hollow Image” explores interesting territory — that of the black person who is “making it” in the wide, wide world and is, at the same time, being alienated from past roots. Are there obligations to those left behind? Can connections be maintained? Should they be maintained? In what form? Miss Hunkins deals with these questions directly and, on many levels, admirably. The problem is that she hasn't translated them sufficiently into dramatic material. The wheels of calculation are too apparent. The characters are forced frequently to stop and explain what the issues are all about. The somewhat awkward result is salvaged to a remarkable degree by the direction of Marvin Chomsky and the skills of a first‐rate cast. Saundra Sharp plays Harriet, the black woman who is succeeding conspicuously in the chic world of department‐store fashion. Her persistent suitor, Paul (Robert Hooks), is an ambitious lawyer. Harriet goes back to Harlem and is caught up again in an affair with Danny (Dick Anthony Williams). Which road will she take — Manhattan chic or Harlem roots? (The seemingly simple question is painfully real, for many whites as well as blacks.) Miss Hunkins has spiced her effort with two perpheral Saundra Sharp in “Hollow Image,” Sunday, 9 P.M., ABC. characters — Sweet Talk, a Harlem resident who is trapped in drugs, and Ivy, a pop singer who has constructed bridges between her many worlds. The roles are performed very effectively by Morgan Freeman and Hattie Winston. With all of its flaws, “Hollow Image” deserves attention. It struggles. It doesn't always succeed, but at least struggles."
State Is Upheld On Supervising Abortion Clinic,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/23/archives/state-is-upheld-on-supervising-abortion-clinic-ruling-made-on-state.html,"A decision strongly supporting New York State's authority to regulate abortion facilities was issued yesterday by Federal district iudee in Manhattan_ The judge, Henry Werker, stressed in 17‐page ,decision that “the fact that an abortion clinic must conform to mini‘ mum health and safety standards would not in any way coerce a woman into not having an abortion.” Judge Werker ruled against the Westchester Women's Health Organization, which maintains an office in White Plains for first‐trimester abortions. These are abortions performed during the first three months of pregnancy. The organization sued the state's Health Department to challenge state authority to regulate the abortion facility under Article 28 of the New York Public Health Law, but the judge's decision dismissed the suit. Ruling Made on State's Role Although he noted there was “no evidence of abuse or less-than-high quality medical care” at the abortion facility in White Plains, the judge ruled that the stale possessed the power to license and regulate it under Article 28. If the state found that the facility violated provisions of Article 28, which con- tains a comprehensive plan for regulating hospitals and other facilities, the judge said the state could require remodeling of the facility to comply with the regulations. A lawyer for the women's organization in the case said a decision on whether to appeal would be made after the judge's ruling had been studied. Judge Werker observed that applying Article 28 to abortion facilities might increase the cost of abortions, but would not be an “undue interference” with the rights of women to decide to have abortions. High Court Decision Cited He said the United States Supreme Court had decided in the landmark case of Roe v. Wade that a woman's fundamental right to privacy included the right to terminate a pregnancy, if she desired, but that the right to an abortion was not absolute. Even in abortions during the first three months of pregnancy, when the least amount of risk is involved, Judge Werker Said, “the state has the power — and responsibility — to insure that abortions are performed with due regard for the health and safety of the patient.” The judge added that the application of Article 28 to “diagnostic or treatment centers which administer first trimester abortions” would place no obstacles in a pregnant woman's path to an abortion because “abortions could still be performed at approved abortion facilities.”"

It was the news story of the year, perhaps of the decade, one the news media were poorly prepared cover because few journalists know theology or church history and because, in the standard manbites‐dog sense, religion is only occasionally “news.” Then, when a right‐to‐lifer firebombs an abortion clinic, an anti‐arms race priest digs a grave on the White House lawn, a bishop marries or a Pope dies, reporters must scurry around in search of a clerical spokesman (most of them are bland and noncommittal) to explain what is going on. Moreover, a certain kind of clerical mind prefers secrecy, knows little about journalism and is, at best, amused by what journalists call the public's “right‐to‐know.” Thus, papal election is to the religious journalist what a big fire is to a cub reporter — the challenge of his career, the chance, as I. F. Stone says, to have a “helluva good time,” if he doesn't “forget it's really burning.” Father Andrew Greeley, the Chicago sociologist and syndicated columnist, has had his eye on this story since 1975, when he began his flights to Rome to gather background and gossip for what was to become “The Making of the Popes 1978: The Politics of Intrigue the Vatican” — his first venture, after 80 books of seriRaymond A. Schroth, S.J., an associate editor Commonweal and associate professor of communications at Fordham University, has been named dean Rockhurst College, Kansas City, Mo. ous sociology, popular history, theology and commonsense sex advice, into the New Journalism. His model, he says, is Theodore H. White, his fellow witness to history; and with his teasingly disguised sources (two, he says, for every allegation), he clearly identifies with Woodward and Bernstein. But sometimes he seems closer to Lincoln Steffens, whipping up, for Playboy serialization, “The Shame of Vatican City,': discovering some of the same intrigue and disillusionment in Rome that the famous muckraker found in St. Louis and Philadelphia, but ever hopeful that his journalistic “shaming” would help inspire the city's reform. True to the New Journalism genre, Father Greeley brings in his own intellectual and emotional baggage at every opportunity. He is depressed about the decline and drift in the church; the American bishops have ignored his sociological surveys, including his study of the priesthood and his findings on the devastating impact of the 1968 encyclical against birth control, Humanae Vitae, on church attendance. His own diocese, he informs us, suffers the rule of John Cardinal Cody, an incompetent, racist, bizarre tyrant whom the new Pope, if he has the nerve, ought to remove. But the writer has not given up hope; he has come Rome with a profile of an ideal pope — “a hopeful, holy man who smiles.” ‘ “The Making of the Popes 1978,” like many of Father Greeley's other books and columns, is filled with useful insights and information: voting tallies previous conclaves, a long footnote on Vatican nances (the church is not really rich), his attempts to reconstruct the Cook County‐style wheeling and dealing of purple‐garbed conspirators. But Father Greeley, unlike Theodore H. White, has been reluctant to do the writer's work of reorganizing his raw experience. Father Greeley can never decide whether the popes, the church or he himself is his central subject, and gives us instead a repetitious, scarcely edited tape‐recorded diary about everything he thinks, hears or knows: his charges that the Vatican is trying to remove Cardinal Cody, which Cardinal Cody has publicly denied; his sideswipes at journalists who don't see what he sees (he misquotes and distorts Commonweal's editorial on John Paul I); his sinuses and migraines. At the end we share Father Greeley's new‐found hope for the church; but I wish, for his sake, he had either told us more about his personal struggle so we could share it more sympathetically, or had stood back and let the larger story speak for itself. But then he wouldn't be Father Greeley. Peter Hebblethwaite, a former Jesuit and former editor of The Month who covered the conclave for The National Catholic Reporter and The London Times, has established himself as the church's foremost journalist‐theologian. In “The Year of Three Popes,” he gives us a calm, scholarly, occasionally witty history of the contemporary church as reflected in the careers of three holy, and still mysterious, men. Some of his wit is aimed at Father Greeley; but, at heart, the two have a great deal in common: their outrage at the scandalous character assassination in Vatican circles; their disappointment in Paul VI's refusal to accept expert advice on birth control; and their profound respect for John Paul 1, whose abandonment of the tiara was an irrevocable statement about the Petrine office itself, a final relinquishment of the temporal claims of the papacy. The election of Karol Wojtyla to the papacy, said commentator in The New Statesman last fall, had been expected in certain European intellectual circles for some time— an observation that may tell us something about the isolation of some intellectual circles from the general religious press now digging through his published philosophical and spiritual works for clues to the future of his church. Those who still see Humanae Vitae as a shadow threatening the future credibility of the papacy can take little comfort from “Fruitful and Responsible Love.” It consists of an address Cardinal Wojtyla gave to the June 1978 Milan International Congress on the birth‐control encyclical sponsored by the International Center for the Study of Family Life, supplemented by a series of mostly fawning comments from authorities on the family. He emphasizes the importance of mutual love, the necessary connection between conjugal love and its fulfillment parenthood, and the parents’ responsibility to determine their family size with a free and upright conscience. But he jumps to the conclusion that “they will not have recourse to contraception, which is essentially opposed to love and parenthood,” without explaining why, for couples who already have children, every conjugal act need necessarily be open to conception. Indeed, his personalist framework and emphasis on love is the argument many Catholics have used to practice contraception with a clear conscience. Much of what John Paul II has said in his address the Latin American bishops at Puebla, Mexico, and his first, highly personal encyclical, Redemptor Hominis, he had already said to Paul VI and the Roman Curia in a Lenten retreat he preached to them in 1976. As Mr. Hebblethwaite remarks, “he became known to the Curia and the Curia liked what it saw.” These spiritual exercises have now been published as “Sign of Contradiction.” One of the paradoxes of John Paul II may well be that, as much as Catholic progressive intellectuals tend to appreciate a versatile and highly intelligent scholar‐pope, they may have in Wojtyla a man almost too intelligent, a man — unlike John XXIII, who captivated the world by his openness and almost careless boldness —whose learning and convictions in a few crucial areas are so deep that he will find it hard to be educated by broader experience and what Father Greeley calls “the enormous leap from Cracow to Rome.” “Karol Wojtyla,” says Father Greeley, “is going to have to draw back from the attitudes, opinions, and perspectives of a lifetime to be fully effective in his new job.” “Sign of Contradiction” reveals a mind filled with the Scriptures and the Church Fathers, yet unfamiliar or uncomfortable with recent scriptural scholarship; at home with Thomistic philosophy, yet always reinterpreting it in existentialist or phenomenologist terms; absolutely convinced that the false gods of “progress” — consumerism, the hunger for status symbols, technology — diminish man's dignity and his freedom to love. John Paul II warns us that Jesus never intended his opposition to secular and religious authorities to have political implications, but he sees in Jesus carrying his cross the Jewish prisoners in Nazi extermination camps forced to bear quarry stones on their backs and workers ground down by their maWhatever he may be, the new Pope seems a man thoroughly at home with himself. In the long run it will not matter much whether we have a pope who skis, jogs, canoes, sings, strums a guitar, writes poems and plays, tosses babies in the air, or even one who smiles. What matters is how well he reads the various spirits of his own time and can tell which movements enrich and complement Christian humanism and which the church must contradict. “It is the task of the church,” he says, “to fight on the side of man, often against men themselves. Christ fought like that, and he goes on fighting through the, ages in men's hearts and in the human conscience.” With Karol Wojtyla's leadership, it will be a fight to see. ■"
An Ex‐Legislator Ponders Hartford,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/24/archives/connecticut-opinion-an-exlegislator-ponders-hartford.html,"THIS is a time of critical shortage in Connecticut. A shortage not just of gasoline, as if that's not enough, but also of political leadership. The recently ended annual struggles of the Legislature are illustrative. Take housing. Housing is probably Connecticut's single most crying need. People with little money don't even have slums to live in anymore, let alone anything safe, sanitary or decent. One might expect a responsive administration or loyal opposition to promote a program of cure. Not so in Hartford. Great debate raged around the pseudo‐question of whether a separate housing agency should be created. No Republican or Democratic proposals for more funding, none for easier mortgage insurance, nothing to loosen the grip of exclusionary zoning, no program at all. The same observation can be made on other issues as well. Where is the drive for election reform that seemed so inevitable after both the Democratic and Republican conventions last summer? Where are the proposals to help our central cities with their financial distress, let alone their revitalization? Where is the tax reform for a state with such great private wealth and considerable public squalor? Where are the programs to draw young people into our machine trades, now that our average skilled machinist is 60 years old? The purpose of this litany is not to catalogue Connecticut's crises but to remind us that there are plenty of them out there and that no one is doing much about them. In some states there is debate between the political parties as to who offers the best solutions to sundry crises. In other states the parties argue as to whether a crisis may exist. In Connecticut it's different. We all agree a crisis exists but no one proposes to do much about it. All this is not to say that we are short of thoughtful, hard‐working, compassionate, creative legislators and administrators. We have the lot. A bunch of them are even committee chairmen. The problem is not ability or desire; it is direction. One has the scary feeling in the capital that no one is in charge. Legislators and department heads work like beavers promoting this or stifling that, but everyone is on his own. There is no set of goals or priorities making up an overall plan for the year. The place looks like an anthill, only without the underlying sense of purpose that an anthill suggests. Part of the problem lies with the ironbound time limits under which the Legislature operates. All activity is geared to deadlines. Committee chairmen become distracted from the substantive issues by the simple need to do something about all those bills before time runs out. House and Senate leaders panic at the thought of not finishing their business by closing day, which is not altogether surprising since the press tends to measure the quality of administrations by whether they finish their business early or not, rather than by their substantive achievements. It is easy to see how the tradition is passed on when a class of freshmen legislators is warned by the Speaker of the House that his chief goal of the session is to finish all business comfortably ahead of the witching hour. That begins the education of those who got elected dreaming of being part of motivated team grappling with vital policy issues. Is there really a need to do anything? Most readers of The Times probably don't have an urgent sense of Connecticut's becoming a political and economic backwater. The. housing crisis is bearable to those who have a good place to live. Unemployment is not gut issue if you have a job. Tax reform seems less pressing if you make good money. Why bother? That question can best be answered by the residents of Hartford, Bridgeport, New Haven, Waterbury, New London, Scotland, Chaplin, etc., who are watching their quality of life decline and their schools produce graduates unable to cope. Upon reflection the question answers itself. The pertinent question is how to improve the situation. Two retorms spring to mind. The first would be to remove the time limits on each year's session. Let the General Assembly run continuously like the Congress and the Legislatures in some states. This. will get rid of many of the artificial deadlines that stand in the way of the meaningful consideration of many important complex issues. The second reform is to pay legislators enough so they can make it a fulltime job. If we think we can get good government from a group of underpaid, overworked part‐timers, we will continue to get just the kind of government we deserve, namely one that is incapable of grappling with the critical issues. Finally, I guess, we have to demand some leadershp from our leaders. It never ceases to amaze me how docile we citizens become in the presence of a Governor, a Speaker, a majority leader, even a committee chairman. And the press is not much better. There are oodles of questions about controversial appointees, blue laws, abortion and the income tax, but when did you last see an article questioning the administration's plans for subsidized housing, election reform or preservation of manufacturing? Connecticut's policymaking process is fat and lazy, perhaps refletting us. We have developed an unfortunate tradition of not demanding leadership and have received just what we have sought from both parties. To get the kind of government we need we should start with continuous sessions, better pay and a requirement that our leaders lead. William A. Collins is the Mayor of Norwalk and a former two‐term member of the General Assembly. The New York Times"

Philanthropy,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/24/archives/philanthropy-giving-is-getting-reformed-to-aid-those-most-in-need.html,"WASHINGTON — The Young Men's Christian Association is now a standard recipient of charitable contributions.. But if George Williams, the 22‐yearold dry‐goods clerk who started the Y.M.C.A. more than a century ago in England, were starting up America today, he would have great difficulty getting philanthropic funds for his work. According the National Committee on Responsive Philanthropy, Mr. Williams’ venture, like today's women's groups, minority organizations and public interest organizations, would be a “nontraditional donee,” too new, too risky and too controversial to get money from traditional charity sources. In addition, his age and occupation, like those of many in today's nontraditional organizations, would effectively make him unable to influence the philanthropic circles of power ‐ mainly the white, middle‐aged and successful males who govern corporate and foundation giving. Something has gone wrong with America's charitable giving, according to the N.C.R.P. Instead of succoring the poor, the needy and the least powerful, most of the more than $35 billion in annual charitable giving since 1977 has gone to tried and true organizations, to such groups as the Boy Scouts, major hospitals, universities and museums. “The nonprofit world thinks of itself as God's gift to America,” said Robert 0. Bothwell, N.C.R.P.'s executive director. “Yet if you look back at the four or five major social action and public interest movements in this country during the last decade — the civil rights movement, the women's movement, the environment, older Americans, and other ethnic activist movements — you'll find funding of such organizations by and large negligible.” Four reports released during the last year seem support the group's contentions. For example, in report on 131 foundations and charities done for the Donor's Forum in Chicago, higher education got the majority of grants, some 30.8 percent of the $41.5 million awarded to local recipients in the city, with fully 10 percent going to the University of Chicago. Health was the second largest area of giving with large hospitals getting $4 million of the $8 million total allotted for that category. Despite the rise in teenage pregnancies and abortions, only 1 percent of the health money was alloted to family planning programs. Neighborhood health centers or groups dealing with drug and alcohol abuse also received little funding. Similar funding patterns emerged in three other studies done in Colorado, San Francisco, and Washington, D. C. • In the Washington study of 153 Washington‐based foundations and the United Way which gave away $32.2 million in 1976, 62 percent went to groups outside the city or that provided “no discernible direct services or benefits to District residents.”  •The Colorado Study, by the Colorado Committee for Responsive Philanthropy between 1974 and 1976, discovered that only 2.7 percent of the grant money distributed by Colorado's 25 largest foundations went to “nontraditional” organizations.  •The Bay Area study of 45 large foundations in the San Francisco area determined that much of the foundations’ funds went for permanent support for small group of organizations while new groups usually got one‐time funding for short periods. Diverse Origins Noting such patterns, the three‐year‐old N.C.R.P. has become the gadfly of the philanthropic world. An outgrowth of the Donee Group, a coalition of public interest, social action and volunteer groups that acted as advisers in 1975 to the Filer Commission on Private Philanthropy and Public Needs, sponsored in 1973 by the late John D. Rockefeller 3d, the committee now includes a diverse group of organizations from the National Council of Churches and Common Cause to the National Organization of Women's Legal Defense and Education Fund and the National Black United Fund. It has challenged the United Way's claim that “it works for all of us” and United Way's unique access to the chief and cheapest source of fundraising — the payroll deduction for charity. In general, the group has criticized the funding priorities of corporate and foundation giving as well as accessibility to them by nontraditional organizations. Its work is respected, if not always agreed with, by foundation and corporate funding members, and some of its suggestions have been instituted by corporate and foundation philanthropic groups. For example, the committee has declared the limited perspectives that foundation trustees have because of their homogeneous background and called for foundations to hold public meetings to introduce variety into their decisions. In 1976, the Bush and Otto Bremer Foundation in Minnesota held the first such public meeting. Since then the Lincoln Foundation in Nebraska and the Mary Reynolds Babcock Foundation in North Carolina have followed suit. “A lot of foundations are hesitant about public meetings,” said William Bondurant, executive director of the Babcock Foundation, explaining that last year the group ran announcements of the foundation's meeting in newspapers and on television and sent out invitations in order to generate public interest. “But we found public meetings instructive.” We got a chance to hear from voices that we wouldn't ordinarily hear from and it gave us an opportunity to explain why we can't fund every group,” Mr. Bondurant continued. He said that out of the meeting the Babcock Foundation learned about the Carolina Brown Lung Association, an organization dedicated to eradicating byssinosis, a debilitating and eventually fatal disease of textile workers which is caused by cotton dust. As a result, the foundation is funding the organization. “In order to stay alive and vital, foundations need organizations like the N.C.R.P. to prod and goad us from time to time,” Mr. Bondurant concluded. Jack Shakely, director of communications for the Council on Foundations, a philanthropic trade association, said that corporate giving has been changing, however subtly, over the last five years. “They're becoming a little more adventurous their grant recipients,” he said, noting that the Syntex Corporation in Palo Alto, Calif., had funded black organizations and encouraged other corporations to expand their giving to other nontraditional organizations. Levi Strauss Corporation in San Francisco has provided management and technical assistance to groups on how to approach foundations. Opening Foundations UP Still, there is some hesitancy in moving towards new directions. Mr. Shakely said that while some corporations and foundations were sympathetic to public meetings, others felt that what they give to whom “is nobody's business but their own.” Mr. Shakely said the Council encourages foundations to publish annual reports so that the public is aware of philanthropic grants and opportunities, adding that part of the reluctance of some organizations to do so came from a fear that they would be inundated with funding requests. He said that studies done by the council on the efficacy of annual reports showed that instead of more proposals being generated, annual reports and information on a foundation's interests produced better proposals, directed towards those interests. Efforts to broaden the philanthropic constituency have also been undertaken by some corporations: Cummins Engine in Columbus, Indiana, several years ago invited people from black organizations to talk to the foundation and help them shape their corporate giving. Monsanto Chemical in St. Louis in 1976 did a complete review of its contributions program. “Our thrust had been fairly conservative and we were largely giving to tried and true organizations,” said William Symes, president of the Monsanto Fund. “We decided because of rising profits that we should be giving more and we decided to give to some cutting‐edge organizations that were meeting the emerging and existing societal needs.” Still, there is room for change in the philanthropic world. Some of the newer, younger philanthropic groups were initiated because their donors felt a need for change. One such group is the Vanguard Foundation of San Francisco, set up in 1971 by Obie Benz, the heir to a food‐processing fortune, and seven other so‐called “fat kittens.” Vanguard is part of a cooperative of other similarly‐minded foundations, such as New York's North Star, Los Angeles’ Liberty Hill Foundation, Bread and Roses and the People's Fund in Philadelphia, Boston's Haymarket People's fund and the McKenzie River Gathering Fund in the Pacific Northwest. All these foundations support projects that are too young, too new, or too activist for traditional sources. In the last three years Vanguard has funded low‐income community organizing projects, prison reform, rent reform projects and women's groups. Vanguard is a nonendowed foundation and most of its grants are small, averaging $1,000. Responsive Philanthropy officials feel that donations could become a source of support for groups addressing emerging social problems, for individuals with new ideas, for alternative approaches to problems still too new or untested to receive government funding, and for supporting community organizations that have active citizen involvement. “There are 26,000 philanthropic organizations in this country and yet it's hard to know what their giving goes for because their categories are so general,” said Mr. Bothwell. “But what we've seen is that philanthropy today continues to fund traditional organizations far beyond their useful life. Parts of what the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller foundations, the Carnegie Foundation have done are really terrific, but even these devote a very small percentage to nontraditional organizations.” Mr. Bothwell said that emerging social trends having to do with women's groups, ethnic groups, older Americans, and social change groups are now part of the American social fabric. They won't go away. “We're going to continue to try to dig up information to illuminate this country and foundation leaders, both locally and nationally, and work towards increasing philanthropy's accountability,” said Mr. Bothwell.

Convention Speech Stirs Foes of Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/24/archives/convention-speech-stirs-foes-of-abortion-factor-in-elections.html,"CINCINNATI, June 23 — The keynote address was entitled “Medical Holocaust” and the 2,000 or so delegates to the National Right to Life convention listened attentively as William C. Brennan, a professor of sociology at St. Louis University, compared abortions in America in the 1970's to the extermination of Jews by Nazi Germany in the 1940's. Special to The New York Times “American doctors have, since the Supreme Court decision of 1973, destroyed over six million unborn human beings,” he said, referring to the Court's ruling that abortion in the first three months of pregnancy is a matter between a woman and her physician. As the evening wore on and as Mr. Brennan drew parallel after parallel between American society today and that of Nazi Germany, his voice increasing in intensity and fervor, the audience began to stir. Licensed physicians, he said, are “the executioners,” the bureaucrats who provide support services are the “medical mercenaries,” and the Upjohn Company, which manufactures medicines and devices used for abortions, is the I.G. Farben, a reference to the German concern that made chemicals used in mass executions. By the time he said that the news media were like that of Hitler's Germany “in concealing the facts and the public's right to know,” the audience was on its feet giving him a tumultuous ovation. Mr. Brennan, in branding much of society as murderers or collaborators, had touched the central nerve of the force that drives a political movement that has grown in numbers and effectiveness in the last two years. It has become by far the strongest of the single‐issue lobbying groups. It says it has more than 11 million members in 1,800 chapters across the country and It is expecting to have a substantial impact on next year's Federal, state and local elections. Assertions that abortions are legalized murder and that the enormity of the collective crime keeps increasing was the theme that permeated the meetings of the movement's first national meeting since it scored some surprising victories in last year's elections. “The pro‐life movement has turned the corner during the past year,” said Dr. Carolyn Gerster, a Scottsdale, Ariz., physician who is president of the National Right to Life Committee Inc., the umbrella group for a proliferation of organizations that want to nullify the Supreme Court's decision. Because the victories provided a psychological lift, Dr. Gerster said at a news conference, the movement has set three‐year goal for pushing through Congress a constitutional amendment that would end legalized abortions, except to save the life of the mother. “We know we can do it now,” said Dr. Gerster. “We have matured.” Factor in Elections Involvement of hundreds of thousands of “right to life” volunteers in the campaigns last summer and fall was a major factor in a number of Senate, House and gubernatorial races, most notably the defeat of Senator Dick Clark, Democrat of Iowa, by a conservative Republican, Roger Jepsen, who supports the “right to life” movement. In New York, the Right to Life Party polled more than 100,000 votes in the gubernatorial election, enough to insure an automatic place on the ballot in future elections. But success has also brought divisions on procedure. Sean Morton Downey Jr., a Nevada businessman and a former supporter of President Carter and the Kennedy brothers, announced a few days ago that he would run for President in the Democratic primaries as a “right to life” candidate. Mr. Downey is head of the Life Amendment Political Action Committee, one of the political arms of the movement. Mr. Downey, in an interview, said the movement was now strong enough to move into other issues and he would organize his campaign around a “God, family and country” theme and would include the “pocketbook issues of inflation, the energy crunch, and a strong national defense. At the convention, Mr. Downey added Senator John Glenn, Democrat of Ohio, to the list of senators his committee has selected for defeat in 1980. Previously, the group had named Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, and Democrats Frank Church of Idaho, John C. Culver of Iowa, Birch Bayh of Indiana, Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont and George McGovern of South Dakota as targets of the movement for failure to support its anti‐abortion positions. Dr. Gerster and others believe the movement should stick to the one issue, abortion, and have moved to set up an “internal” political action committee that would restrict itself to that issue. Nor does she believe senators ought to be selected for defeat at this time, she said in an interview. She hopes, she said, that some of the liberal senators can be brought around by persuasion before the campaigns. Ellen McCormack of New York, the 1976 Presidential candidate of the ProLife Action Committee, was also upset by Mr. Downey's entry into the race on multiple issues. She said she would probably run in the general election as an independent but that there was still the possibility she might run in the Democratic primaries, too. The “right to life” advocates have been unable to agree on a single approach to achieving a constitutional amendment, so they are pursuing both routes — seeking action by the states and Congress.

Dire Forecast For County On Recession,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/24/archives/westchester-weekly-dire-forecast-for-county-on-recession-dire.html,"WITHIN the next five years Westchester's economy will suffer more sharply than other areas of the country from the effects of a recession, according to a report on the county's future re cently completed by the Hudson Institute, the Croton‐based research organization. Proximity to New York City and its serious fiscal problems, loss of jobs and population from the region, and a high tax burden combined with the likelihood of a national recession will result in significant short‐term economic stresses for the county, according to the study. “Our best guess is that things are going to get worse here before they get better,” said Jane Newitt, project director for the Hudson Institute study. “But in the long run, the county will recover from the recession faster than the city and most of the rest of the region.” The report, entitled “The Future of Westchester County: A Guide for Long‐Range Social Needs Assessment,” is thought to be unique in the breadth and scope of its projections about Westchester. It is the first such county‐level report conducted by the Hudson Institute. Sponsored jointly by the United Way of Westchester and the County Department of Social Services, the Westchester report was designed to provide county officials with a longrange planning tool that could be used to determine the social‐service needs of county residents in the years to come. “Our hope was that instead of always reacting to yesterday in our planning, the study would enable us to look to the future to assess needs,” said Charles Bates, Commissioner of the Westchester County Department of Social Services. Financed with $100,000 in Federal, state and local funds, the report seeks to define county needs over the next five, and 25 years in the context of changing economic, demographic and sociological factors. The Hudson Institute, which was founded by Herman Kahn, is a major research institution that analyzes issues related to national security, social policy and international order. Because of its well‐regarded work for major corporations and government agencies and its location within the county, county officials felt the Institute was a logical choice for the Westchester study. A major part of the report is that Westchester's economic health is inextricably intertwined with that of New York City and the region and thus would suffer significantly in the event of a national recession. Representatives of the Westchester business community, while acknowledging that some of the sociological conclusions of the study may be valid, are skeptical about its predictions of impending hard times. “In my opinion the assumption is just plain wrong,” said S. J. Schulman, president of the Westchester County Association, a countywide business and industrial organization that represents the private sector. “Westchester generally tends to outperform the rest of the country economically and has done so for years. Even if the economic climate worsens, the county tends to suffer less severely than other parts of the nation.” He pointed to the latest unemployment rate of under 5 percent and the lack of vacant office space in Westchester as indicators of a strong economic climate. In addition, he emphasized the collection of corporate headquarters and nationally prominent businesses situated in the county. “Westchester is dominated by a stable, corporate management situation and therefore I don't see any basis for perceiving the county in a way more vulnerable than the rest the nation,” he concluded. According to the study, Westchester has experienced a loss of population since 1970, an outmigration of the young (particularly those participating in the work force), a disproportionately high inflation rate and tax burden, and a loss of manufacturing industries characteristic of the larger region. The study said that in 1950 Westchester had the highest median family income in the region but that by 1970 it was surpassed by Nassau County and closely rivaled by Rockland, Bergen and Fairfield Counties. Despite the movement of many New York‐based operations to Westchester in past years and a satisfactory recovery from the recession in the earlier part of this decade, it said, Westchester lost about percent of its manufacturing production jobs from 1970 and 1975, giving rise to an increasingly unhealthy imbalance economic growth. Based upon its interpretation of regional and national data, the study indicates these trends in the county in the next decade: q An accelerated aging of the county's population, skilled young workers leave the area for jobs in other sections of the country. q An increase in the number of poor families living within the county, particularly in the southern tier, as a result of emigration from New York City, fewer employment opportunities for semiskilled workers and possible reduced lack of access to abortion for low‐income women. q A rapidly shrinking teen‐age population as children born in recent years, a period of low birthrate, move through the elementary schools to the high schools. q An increased demand for singlefamily homes in the county as the “baby boom” generation enters the home‐buying and child‐bearing stages. q Decreased political influence in Washington as statewide population losses are reflected in Congressional reapportionment after the 1980 Census. It is the last of these predictions and its implications for federally financed social programs, coupled with an increasingly conservative trend among taxpayers — that has caused Mrs. Newitt to conclude that there might be increased conflict between the various groups demanding social services in the late 1980's. The report, citing a growing tendency toward the use of social services by middle‐income individuals, suggests that there will be a continued demand for such services in the next decade. Shrinking Federal expenditures coupled with those demands, however, may lead to a conflict between the “haves” and “have‐nots” for those services. In addition, the report makes several references to the potential for tensions between the aged and the young in Westchester in the competition for jobs, pension benefits and housing. The study suggests that at the end” of the projected recession, Westchester's economic condition will begin to improve at a faster rate than that of the city. This could intensify the “fortress mentality” of the county, it said. In the concluding chapter of the Westchester study, Mrs. Newitt writes: “Thus the 1980's will be a time when the territorial issue of social responsibility will be an especially troubling one. At a time when loss of legislative strength will increase the importance of identifying shared city‐county interests, this will be more difficult than ever.” While the report does not make broad recommendations or address specific social‐service problems, the study is, according to Mr. Bates, a new and innovative tool that can be used effectively by other social‐service agencies. “The report has taught us to stretch our thinking and take another look at our planning,” he said. “The actual cost of the report to the county was small, but from a point of view of impact, the study has already had a powerful effect.”"
KENNEDY: TIME OF DECISION,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/24/archives/kennedy-time-of-decision-kennedy.html,"The youngest of the nine children of Joseph and Rose Kennedy, Edward Kennedy lost the last of his three brothorc nn Junp 6 1968 His father was still alive, but not able to speak because of a stroke. So on that June day, at the age of 36, Kennedy became not only a possible President but also the head of a large family emptied of its men, and he was not ready. His mourning for his last brother was a time of turmoil, ending somewhere near midnight in an overturned car, in a pond off Chappaquiddick Island. It was an accident which he did not report for 10 hours and which some still think stands between him and the Presidency — that and a troubled marriage, a wife living away from him trying not to drink. Yet all the polls indicate that Kennedy could beat anyone, Democrat or Republican, that many can forgive him for everything, but something stops him from running. The question is not whether he will or will not ultimately run. The question for now is: What makes Ted Kennedy run? Chappaquiddick was, all his friends agree, a turning point for Edward Kennedy. He stopped being frenetic in the way he had been those summers. “He had been through a lot before,” one friend said, “personal trials, the plane crash, his brothers’ deaths, his father's stroke. But in funny way, it was the only tragedy totally of his own making, and he felt that. I think it quieted him, it killed all that, the excesses. There are two sides to Teddy, the public and the private. The implication to the public side after Bobby's death was: Now you've inherited the scepter, the mantle, you'd better get your act together. But between that death and Chappaquiddick, the freneticism had intensified with the pressure. And after Chappaquiddick he just was never that frantic again.” He stopped, too, feeling guilty, said another friend, for not having felt as strongly about Robert Kennedy's death as Robert Kennedy himself had felt about John's. Sorrow did not come as easily to him as it did to Robert Kennedy, and fo5r that he was truly sorry. There was another turning point that summer. A month after Chappaquiddick, Joan Kennedy miscarried for third time. There would be no more children. “After that I just thought we'd tried hard she said. Ted Kennedy went back to the Senate. The day he got back, Senate majority leader Mike. Mansfield came over and put his arms around him and said, “I'm glad you're back.” Claude Hooten, his Harvard pal, sitting in the gallery, had tears in his eyes. It was until 1971 that Kennedy began emerge from the shadow of Chappaquiddick, too late to hold on to the Democratic whip seat that he then held, which was taken by Robert Byrd West Virginia. Ted talked about quitting. “What do you think about family in politics?” he asked Fred Dutton, Kennedy political overview man, in typically elliptical way. “I mean, don't you think there is something more Kennedy stayed and his chief aide David Burke left, knowing that Kennedy couldn't, or wouldn't, be a Presidential candidate in 1972. There is always that chance that if he doesn't go, his best staff people will, and those are not small losses because after days and nights and asides together, it is hard to start with someone new. George McGovern did call Kennedy in the summer of that year at the Cape and asked him to be his running mate. McGovern said it was for the good of the country. Kennedy went out and walked on the beach for 95 minutes. Hooten, who was with him, said: “I just wanted to beat McGovern up; it was so cruel to come at Ted that way, with that line about the good of the country.” Kennedy said no, and there are those who think he should have said yes, that he should have run then, with McGovern, and that Chappaquiddick would have come up big and been over with. With Burke gone, Kennedy brought Eddie Martin back to be his administrative aide, the friend with whom he could banter and semireminisce —Kennedys don't reminisce much about good times or bad — in his family way. “I always viewed Eddie Martin as a piece of. the Senator's personality,” another aide said. “All Kennedys have their Eddie Martins. They could shoot the bull together, laugh about people back home. He couldn't do that, that way, with the rest of the staff.” He hired, too, Paul Kirk, a very savvy, very blue‐eyed young man, of whom it is said on the staff, as the Irish expression goes, “he wouldn't tell you if your coat was on fire.” He hired, too, Carey Parker, an unassuming man, a Rhodes scholar and a tax specialist; and, for a while, Kennedy was working more or less with contemporaries. He slowly began to speak out on big things, on tax reform and on campaign finance reform and on health, always health, and on gun control. His attempt to ban the shipment of long guns through the mails had begun just three weeks before his second brother's death, and he was gone during the summer after —missing the debate, there for the vote on Sept. 18 — but somehow not there, distant, uninvolved. The legislation passed. He has, in the years since, introduced bills and various amendments to bills to require the registration of all handguns and the licensing of all gun owners. None of them have passed and his staff is readying a new gun‐control bill that Kennedy will introduce in In health care, it is the same story, long one with few victories to tell of, and for a man from money, his heart seems in this, too. He introduced the first big national health insurance bill, S.3, in 1971, then again in 1973. When was obvious it would not pass, he joined Wilbur Mills in the House to sponsor a modified plan which included, as his original had not, a $150 deductible clause and made the insurance companies intermediaries, and he lost his labor‐union support and was accused of waffling. “There is a ball game going on up there,” he said to a downtown Washington group just before the Kennedy‐Mills bill was introduced. “And I'm going to be part of that ball game. don't want to be outside the park listening to the cheers and yells.” So there was that, too, the political instinct in there beside the heart, always. The Kennedy‐Mills bill did not pass, and Kennedy reintroduced S.3 again in 1975. It still did not pass, and he has just now, in 1979, unveiled a new plan, much more a man for the long haul than either of his brothers. The most quietly radical legislation he ever introduced, in 1974, a small thing but somehow so radical, would have required all medical students to serve in underserved places, for two years after graduation. It was radical because the shifting of people that way in this country is radical. That did not pass, either. In November 1973, Kennedy's oldest son, Edward Kennedy Jr., then 12, had a leg removed because of cancer. In the months he was in the hospital, his father stayed with him, often sleeping there. A little less than a year later, he called a press conference in Boston and announced that he would not be a candidate for the Presidency in 1976; his family problems would preclude it. His oldest son was not all well; his youngest, Patrick, had severe asthma; his daughter, Kara, was unhappy and running away from home, and his wife, who was O.K. when her son was very sick, nursing him, collapsed afterward, and was sad or whatever else it is that makes people drink. Kennedy himself gave up drinking for a year. “He wanted to clear his conscience,” friend said. “He always felt so guilty about having brought her into the environment he did. He said she ought to have married a New York banker. He felt terrible about Chappaquiddick but not guilty; he thought he'd done all he could. But he kept feeling guilty for about Joan.” Eddie Martin left in 1977; Paul Kirk left in 1978. Carey Parker stayed to anchor the staff and a new, a third generation, came in, men younger than Kennedy, so he was finally the father there, too. He runs his current staff of 90 much as his father ran the family, everybody competing and jockeying for the Senator's approval and affection. One morning he had scheduled a health subcommittee hearing and a Judiciary subcommittee hearing at the same time. He called his health people. “How many TV cameras have you got me?” he asked. They said six. Then he called his Judiciary people and said, “They have six cameras over there. How many do you have?” They had eight. So he called the health people back and said, “Sorry, they have two more, guess I'll go to theirs.” His main young men — his 26‐yearold administrative aide, Richard Burke; Dr. Larry Horowitz, 34, his chief health adviser; Kenneth Feinberg, 32, counsel to the Judiciary Committee, a former prosecutor who is the architect of his crime bill S. 1437, and his press secretary, former reporter Thomas Southwick, 30, and his political operative, Carl Wagner, 33 — these young men want to please him the way he and his brothers wanted to please their father, and he lets them try. They bring statistics to him like presents, learning early to understand his half sentences. At staff meetings he sits, the patriarch, slumped, smoking a cigar, peering over his glasses at them, mostly listening, “sucking the information out of them,” as one adviser said, “as if they were tulips. They work very hard; there is always the possibility that they might someday be Metternichs or Kissingers.” This is a typical Kennedy beginning to a staff meeting, this one on energy: “But there are, you know … I talked with someone at the White House … we have to set up a scenario on, you know, a variety of efforts to impact [his current favorite verb] energy, to see what the hell we can … we need to take a look at Scandinavia … I mean, I don't know what they're doing there but we ought to find … and the Japanese … I don't know what … well, what do the rest of you think?” Someone knows about Scandinavia already, in detail, and tells him, quietly, and then someone else talks about power plants and someone else talks about coal and the meeting goes on for half an hour and everyone leaves knowing exactly what is to be done, what is expected. “Work it out,” Kennedy says. It is his favorite phrase. And they do. They carry with them the conviction that working for a Kennedy, their Kennedy, is like working for no one else on earth. “It's a whole life working for him,” Eddie Martin said. “If you left the office before he left, you always felt guilty.” That conviction and that guilt makes the staff productive and eager and there is nothing cool and coy about them; they have no pretenses about being laid back, just as “the boss” doesn't. It is a crucial difference between Kennedy and Carter, the kinds of staffs their temperaments have invited — Carter's all low‐key, unvivid, and Kennedy's eager, strong in their office chauvinism. “Kennedy's staff is far more aggressive than anyone else's,” said someone who worked for him, “far less sensitive to the ego needs of other staffs and other senators. There was a health hearing in West Virginia and they didn't contact the home senators. They worked for Teddy and he views himself as a national figure. The policies are his; they just give him the mechanisms. Once you're his staff, you're his staff. If you leave, you just always miss him, you miss his office.” In this world there is not much room for women. He hires them but rarely for key positions; some of them leave quite embittered. Kennedy does support women's issues like the equal rights amendment and the right to Medicaid‐financed abortions — he is not for abortion per se, but as it is legal, he supports Medicaid coverage so poor women are not denied access — but staff women, professional women who work for him, make him nervous, make him look away. Irish and Catholic and chivalrous, an inveterate door‐opener, he simply does not know how to be in charge of them. He cannot banter with them, and he has to be able to banter. So around him are bright young men. Nights on the road, after long days of shaking hands and touring slums, he buys them beer — often borrowing their money to buy them beer — $5 bills, he likes fives — he talks about hockey scores and makes them laugh, referring to himself in the third person. Questioned on a home trip to Massachusetts by someone at a speech about the drinking age at a time when the state was about to raise it, Kennedy, not wanting to get into it, mumbled something about people not drinking until they reached the age of maturity. Back in the car, pressed on what age that might be, he quipped: “I don't know. I haven't reached it yet.” Later he said, “Well, what did you think of the Senator's answer to that question? …” They knew what question and what answer and they laughed. Some of them make him laugh, but it is not quite a give and take. Too many years and too many reference points and too many Holiday Inns lie between. know that if he runs for President, they are not quite the first string; David Burke would probably come back and Paul Kirk and maybe some of the old‐timers, some of Jack's men or Bobby's men, though they have made new lives now, as much as possible. Washington is still full of men who belonged to Bobby — John Kennedy was so long ago, now — men who have moved from cubicle to cubicle, from office to office carrying their Kennedy pictures. One feels them in that town like an undertow. “With the passage of time,” said Edwin Guthman, a former press secretary to Robert Kennedy, “the sense of loss just gets worse rather than better. Bobby was the kind of man other men would follow into combat feeling that they could not die.” “Ted Kennedy is a much more conventional figure than his brothers,” said a man who worked for them. “There were things about them that were larger than life; they had a literary dimension to them. But I think Teddy is finally.no longer intimidated by their memory. Virtually anyone close to Bob would be willing to do anything for Ted, not out of blind loyalty, but out of a strong feeling that he has the capacity. He knows his limitations. There is clearly a level of consciousness that was not there 10 years ago. Pain, drop by drop, does produce a deeper human being.” Of himself Kennedy says: “I like to think I have, over the process of life experiences, developed or refined my own values. I think we Kennedys are sort of constant learners. As life moves forward, our range of interests grows. Am I calmer? I suppose so. I suppose I am. I suppose … well, that's all.” “Remember,” Fred Dutton said, “he's been No. 1 a lot longer than Bob was No. 1. And the father was still alive when his brothers were, so Ted's really the only man since Joe Kennedy to be the head of that family. And that means a lot.” Eunice Shriver, Kennedy's sister, who is sometimes referred to as the head of the family because she is terribly energetic and older, and because Ted Kennedy would not and could not displease her, said of her brother: “He's had a hard time because he's had to do it all on his own. President Kennedy had my father and Joe Jr.; Bobby had all three. But Teddy's been without all of them for a long time.” Kennedy has no sense — or none that he speaks of — that his political heritage was anything less than liberal. To questions about the Vietnam War or the Bay of Pigs, he says simply that we must learn from our mistakes, must stay in touch with the opposition leaders of other countries so we don't find ourselves on the wrong side. His father's politics and the way he made his money are history to him. “I'm a believer in the here and now,” he says time and again. Once, when Robert Kennedy was running for the Presidency, he had a lunch with an impassioned young woman who worked with Cesar Chavez. “Your father owned Cutty Sark,” she said accusingly. “He did not,” Kennedy said. “Well then, he owned Schenley's,” she said. “I don't know,” he said calmly, “but whatever my father owned he doesn't own it anymore.” He was not angry. The man who had arranged the lunch said, in the four years he had worked for Kennedy, that that was the only time he heard him speak of his father in that way. If similarly challenged about his father, Ted Kennedy, one imagines, would have been no less directly defensive, perhaps a bit more flustered. His politics now, in 1979, are a mix of left and right, of social consciousness and old‐fashioned capitalism. On one side is his devotion to the nonderegulation of oil and national health insurance. Last month, he unveiled another rendition, combed as he is in the mornings, in the room where his brothers both announced their Presidential candidacies. Carter and Kennedy agree on the need for national health insurance and disagree on the way to effect it, both insisting on exaggerating the differences between their plans as if it were a miniPresidential referendum. Kennedy's new bill is a comprehensive, SO‐billion birth‐to‐death plan. It is a testimony to his political savvy that he has again included the insurance companies as intermediaries while holding, this time, the support of the unions. Carter's plan, unveiled earlier this month, is quiet by comparison, a 1;24‐billion phase‐in plan, pegged to inflation, which would provide catastrophic coverage for medical expenses above $2,500. Kennedy says that's not good enough, that he would “vote no” on Carter's plan. Kennedy disagrees with Carter, too, about the deregulation of oil, favoring, as in health, a controlled market. This, for lack of a better description, is KenneOn the other side, mitigating against his big liberal image, are his crime bill and his various deregulation bills. Introduced by Kennedy in early 1976, the crime bill, S. 1937, got through the Judiciary Committee and passed in the Senate. But hard‐core liberals jumped on the bill because it seemed to broaden the definition of crime, of conspiracy, and it died in the House committee. It has been modified and Kennedy will reintroduce it in a few weeks. He is also against the deregulation of oil, because he says the oil market is not a free market going in, so it must be controlled. But he favors the reinjection of competition into other industries, such as trucking and the airlines, and he quotes endless figures (his memory for them is prodigious) as to why these moves make financial sense. So there is not consistent party line; it is sophisticated piecemeal politics, no binding philosophical overview. It is smart politics, Presidential politics, precluding Carter from painting Kennedy as simply an out‐of‐step big spender; a man going one way as the country lists the other. Kennedy has tailored his liberal as much as possible to the careful, slightly ungenerous, mood of the country. Unlike Carter, he is a master of the elegant political gesture. The night before he was going to vote against an arms sale to their countries, he called both the Egyptian and Saudi Arabian ambassadors to explain why. When he went to the funeral of Pope John Paul I, in Rome, dark‐suited again, he stopped by the place from which Aldo Moro was kidnapped. Some would say that these are simply gestures, that they do not matter, that Kennedy, if he is still at all weak somewhere, is weak in the area of foreign affairs. His speeches about world matters do tend to be a bit rambling and rhetorical. As a shadow President, he must always have a position on Carter's positions, which he does, praising Carter for his efforts on strategic arms limitation, and for his human rights program, differing from him on the treatment of Taiwan, and voting against Carter's proposed Middle East sale. Kennedy feels bolder on domestic ground. About what goes on at home, about the future of the country, Kennedy can talk easily, in full voice, to an audience of one or 1,000. He talks about there being no magic wand; about the increasing power of special interests and of single‐issue constituencies; about how the American people need to be challenged; that they have not, Proposition 13 aside, lost their central compassion; that they need to be challenged the way his brothers challenged them — not mentioning their names, just “my brothers” — knowing that the myth of them grows with his obliqueness. There is shrewdness there, too, in that obliqueness, along with the sadness. There is something politically provocative about the aloneness of this Kennedy, a feeling that if he wants the Presidency, the American people almost somehow owe it to him because of what happened to his brothers. But does he want it? Kennedy knows he is at the top of the polls; the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll on June 10 showed that 73 percent of Democrats regarded Kennedy favorably, compared with only 43 percent for Carter. “These are very good odds for anyone else,” said a sometime adviser, “but there is a part of all Kennedys that wants to be crowned, not elected.” Kennedy says he's encouraged by the response of the American people, but he keeps insisting that Carter is his candidate. Kennedy says he met privately with the President on March 21 to indicate his “tentative support” of Carter for the Democratic nomination, yet Kennedy was quoted in The Boston Globe early this month saying that he would think “terribly seriously” about running for President in 1980 if Jimmy Carter withdrew from the Kennedy lights his cigars from matchbooks engraved with a picture of the White House on one side and Jimmy Carter's name on the other. He grins when he does it. But, on the other hand, he is sparring with Carter more and more, about oil, about health, grinning when he does that, too. And Carter is beginning to scrap; he told several Democratic Representatives at a White House dinner that he would “whip” Kennedy if the Senator opposed him for the nomination. “It's been kind of fun,” Kennedy said of the sparring. “I suppose there'll be a certain amount more.” If it's a game, it might go on too long. Kennedy likes the sparring and maybe it's for real, for final real, and maybe it isn't and maybe, just maybe, he himself doesn't know. He hasn't categorically, absolutely said no, and he knows he hasn't said no, not really. So it's spinning now, and he's letting it spin, the adulation and the longing, and if he's not careful maybe this time he won't stop it in time and he'll have to run, the unions and the blacks and the Carter defectors will somehow make him run. And if he doesn’t do it for the this time. there is a chance that having waited for him for so long, they will finally take their love away and give it to someone else. Walking beside him on a prematurely hot spring day through a Washington park, it is hard to imagine he will run, whatever the odds. The heat makes his sweet cologne very strong; he blushes when asked its name. On the way back to his office he stops in midpark to deliver a fervid, full‐voiced defense of one part of his crime bill — as if a full audience had magically appeared — earnest like the kid in class who is pleased to know all the answers. Then he drops back into his customary trot, tilting forward. There is buoyancy, and beneath it what a friend called the knickers syndrome, the baby‐boy syndrome, and maybe one doesn't ever stop being that, not totally, not from that family. That part of him, the boyish part, the soft part, does not seem to be heading for the White House. Just everything tells you when you're beside him that it is so. But then there is all the bantering with Carter and the coning man, in the chambers, all smooth and smart and commanding, his brothers’ brother who somehow feels he has to do what they did. Carter is currently worried that that might be so. “To the extent that Hamilton [Jordan] reflects the President,” said someone close to Carter, “it must be Kennedy he's afraid of. Carter has the same desire to be loved; he's just less skillful at getting it. He doesn't engender the same kind of love that Kennedy does — but then he also doesn't engender the same kind of hate.” There is that hate, hate for all Kennedys, hate for this Kennedy, and in it envy and the suspicion, still nurtured by some, that he is a lightweight made heavy only by sorrow. With Teddy, the baby, there was always the fear that he hadn't grown up, that he wouldn't, that the cheating and the women and Chappaquiddick were at the heart of him, of his character, and that the other side, the work he did and the father he was, were not somehow the real part. For a long time it was chic to dismiss this Kennedy, the last, as the least; that has turned now, and if John Kennedy is remembered as the coldest Kennedy, and Robert Kennedy as the toughest, then Ted Kennedy, it seems, is to be remembered as the shrewdest. There is always the bandwagon. the attempt to second‐guess history, and the current catch‐all judgment of Kennedy Is that he is a good Senator, the best of the brothers, and there is to some extent a quiet repentance among the reverse snobs who held him once in contempt. “There isn't a new Ted Kennedy,” said someone who has known him for a long time, “just as there wasn't a new Nixon. There isn't a new anybody. But since Chappaquiddick, he has grown and matured. Even those who don't agree with him mostly agree with that. His capacity to absorb information was always evident, and now he has a sureness of hand and judgment. I don't worry about his qualifications to be President, I just worry that people will expect too much of him, too much magic.” Kennedy's days are very long. A typical one begins at 7:30 or 8, when he is briefed at home by one of his aides. He then makes the 25‐minute drive to his office at the Senate; sits through two or three sometimes enlivening, often tedious hours of health or Judiciary Committee hearings; has lunch with somebody; has staff meetings; goes across the street to the Senate to vote; is interviewed; shakes hands and sees all the people who can't get to Carter and some who can. Through it all, he is mostly good‐humored, kind, rumpling as the day goes on. When he does get angry at someone on his staff, he just goes, flapping his hands in his pockets, glaring over his glasses as his father did, saying, “Jeeesus Christ, how could you do that to me; how could you brief me like that. You've got to do your homework. I can't go out there like that. I'm leader.” Those on Kennedy's staff, though younger than he, are protective of him, without ever saying so. They try to keep the hate mail away from him; he gets about 2,500 letters a day (10 full of hate, two serious enough to go to the F.B.I. each week), and then there are phone calls, and the numbers of letters and calls go up the minute he goes up in the polls. And on the anniversaries of the assassinations of his brothers, his staff people are quiet because he is quiet, and they don't schedule much. Nights, he goes home to his big comfortable house in McLean, Va., often driving himself, a little fast, in his slightly beat‐up 1971 Le Mans convertible. He lives there with his two sons. Joan Kennedy is in Boston going to school and going to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. He sees her maybe once a month. His daughter, Kara, is in college near her mother. His oldest son will be going to college next year so Kennedy will be alone with Patrick, who is 15. He is a man of small ceremonies. When he gets home, he lights the candles beside the fireplace in the den. He gives monosyllabic tours of the house. Everywhere there are pictures of his brothers and of his wife and framed family letters, even in the bathroom. He drinks daiquiris, which he drank with his brothers, and always refers to John Kennedy as “The President.” “I don't consider myself a lonely person,” he said. “A lot of it is what you permit yourself. Those kinds of emotions were possible to me many times. It is important to learn, to rediscover things that are important, like taking Patrick sailing. I'm very close to my family, my children, to the cousins and to a very few friends, very few. I enjoy life. I'm challenged by it. I enjoy competition — everyone always wants to beat the Senator. I've had my moments of pause involving personal disappointments. Joan is better, facing up to her problems, so that's hopeful. It's not stopping Jerry Brown that … I mean, it doesn't have anything to do with that; it has to do with the impact on the people, you know, the people one loves, and that family thing was so, I have … with my children. I'm very close to Whether Ted Kennedy stays married is both a personal and political decision. Can a man, and a Roman Catholic man, run for the Presidency halfmarried, or divorced, or remarried? Can Kennedy get divorced and remarry in time for 1989 when, certain friends say, he'd rather run anyway, because more people would have forgotten Chappaquiddick and because, if Carter holds on, he will not then be running against an incumbent, a political boldness for which his temperament is not well suited? These are political questions and they obscure matters of the heart. If there is something left to salvage in the marriage, no one knows; Joan Kennedy says she doesn't know. She says she is proud of herself for moving to Boston, for being on her own. After everything, he was not an easy man to leave. But she did. And, sitting in that house in McLean full of pictures of her when she was young and pretty and unbruised, and of her brothersin‐law when they were young and handsome and in the White House, it is hard to imagine how she could come back. People who see her now say she is still wounded, still fighting hard not to drink, loving him still, and that she is unable to be by his side if he runs; that he cannot run with her trying to mend, cannot divorce either — too Catholic, too traditional, too much his mother's son. There is always his mother. He visits her at least once month in Palm Beach or in Hyannis Port, taking his children often. In the winters, she lives in the big house in Florida with one maid. She is frail and lucid and funny and demanding. She sits at one end of the long dining table and her son sits at the other. There is roast beef and wine and afterward, Jell‐O and chocolatechip ice cream. He interrogates his own children and their cousins about their schoolwork as he remembers his father doing with him and his brothers and sisters. He is funny about it but it is just something he has to do. After dinner, his mother's Palm Beach friends come in for a slide show of his trip to China, and he talks to them in his serious senatorial voice. They leave and his kids go off to some disco, and his mother goes to bed early and he goes to bed. The next day he gets up and he takes her to church and they are pleased with each other. She does not want her son to run; she is the one person who has spoken and people say that if she has spoken, he will not run. “The temptation to be the one to kill the third Kennedy brother is just too great,” she said, cutting through everything else. “It's ironic, the polls indicate that he could be President … but “All I want, if someone's going to blow my head off,” Kennedy once said to a friend, “I just want one swing at him first; I don't want to get it from behind.” Today he says: “The idea of death doesn't bother me. I love life. I've had a full life. I don't mind about my own children. think they're all right now. It's the others, my brothers’ children; I'm sort of an anchor in their lives.” And then he adds, quietly, “I would be much happier if Carter were successful.”"
A Problem of Distrust,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/24/archives/a-problem-of-distrust.html,"THE BLOOD OF PARADISE By Stephen Goodwin. A Henry Robbins Book. 242 pp. New York: E.P. Dutton. $8.95. TEPHEN GOODWIN'S second novel is set in the year of the Watergate hearings, 1973. Anna and Steadman, an attractive, idealistic couple in their late 20's, leave Charlottesville, where he has been a law student, to live on a small farm along the Blue Ridge of central Virginia. Their earlier base had been Washington, where Steadman, scion of a wealthy Southern family, worked for a Congressman and published some fiction while Anna, whose family background is Italian and Catholic, painted and sketched. They have a small daughter, Maggie, whom they both Julian Moynahan teaches at Rutgers University. His most recent novel is “Where the Land and Water Meet.” dote on, but they don't get on that well with each other. As they set forth in their four‐wheel‐drive vehicle for new life in the paradisiacal environs of Zion County, currents of suspicion and resentment play back and forth between them, and each is hoping secretly that the change in their lives will regenerate their marriage. The substance of “The Blood of Paradise” is this effort at regeneration, and it is far from clear, despite an exchange of loving letters at the end — the couple having temporarily separated by then — that the effort succeeds. They have various hang‐ups. Anna, for instance, has a deep tie to an identical twin, Kay, that complicates her feelings toward Steadman. Kay druggy, self‐destructive and envious, an underminer of her sister's life. On her own Anna decides to have secret abortion — perhaps to punish her husband's male egotism and history of infidelities — but when Kay commits suicide on the Washington Beltway, Anna's reaction is to convert her shock and grief into hatred of her husband and to depart for Washington, leaving him alone on the farm with Maggie. Yet she has come to love the farm and the wilderness around it, while shrinking from the violence and bloodiness of rural living — the pain and confusion of livestock giving birth or in disease, the threat of rabid foxes and poisonous snakes on the nearby hills. Steadman is a WASP, and part of his problem is that he seeks approval from and is financially dependent on his grandfather, the cancer‐ridden Watts, a land developer and big daddy figure who castigates his favorite grandson for having escaped the draft, for marrying the likes of Anna, and for aspiring to be writer instead of a budding tycoon in the family corporation. This no‐win situation is scarcely resolved Watts's death, and one surmises that Steadman's sexual flings with countercultural sirens are compensations for inner self‐doubt. Certainly his talent for writing, to judge from a short story included in the text, slight. He can also be morally obtuse, although there is improvement in this area over the course of their year the country. Early on, Steadman wrests the farm he buys from the covetous grasp of an unethical real‐estate agent named Swink. He then punishes Swink, “who was wearing cheap greenish loafers and no raincoat,” by driving him to a remote mountain gorge and abandoning him In pouring rain. Steadman finds this funny, and is still laughing as he returns to Charlottesville to break the lease on the apartment and quit the law‐school course his grandfather's money has paid for. Maggie, who is in the car, is much less obtuse when she observes of Swink, “He's going to get wet.” Steadman is superb at woodcraft, a skillful and hard worker with his hands who can make a go of farming if anybody can. He has been sensitive and adventurous enough to marry an emotionally complex, artistically gifted woman from a tradition different from his own. But for both Anna and Steadman there is a problem of residual distrust that threatens; even at the end, to. spoil their future together. Mr. Goodwin made his literary debut with “Kin” (1975), a story of black‐white relations in the changing South of 1968. The new book has a much richer physical ambience and a more forlorn sense of human possibility. It shows the author getting on with fiction's perennial task of exploring human conduct; his language is fresh and he writes with a fine, if faint, spirit of irony. ■"
Jon Ormond Newman,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/25/archives/jon-ormond-newman-man-in-the-news.html,"HARTFORD — The elevation of Jon O. Newman today from Federal District judge here to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit seems a natural progression in the career of the 47‐year‐old judge. Man In the News President Carter's nomination of Judge Newman had been expected, given the judge's reputation as one of the most intellectually capable in the Federal district that covers New York, Connectjcut and Vermont. Jon Ormond Newman was born May 2, 1932, and grew up in the New Preston section of Washington, Conn. on Lake Waramaug, one of the most scenic areas of the state. His mother is dead and his father retired as a lawyer some years ago, moved to London and became an authority on porcelain. Princeton Honors Graduate The future judge attended Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Conn. Princeton University, where he was graduated magna cum laude, and the Yale University Law School, where he was an editor of The Law Journal. After receiving his law degree in 1957, he won the most coveted of judicial clerkships: he was named senior law clerk to Chief Justice Earl Warren of the United States Supreme Court. It was a time when the Court was handing down landmark rulings on civil rights. After a year of service with Chief Justice Warren, the young lawyer turned to Connecticut politics, serving as counsel to the Democratic legislative majority during the 1959 session. The next year he became special counsel to Gov. Abraham A. Ribicoff, and when Governor Ribicoff became Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare and later Senator, Mr. Newman remained as his chief aide. In 1964, Mr. Newman was appointed by Presideht Johnson as United States Attorney for Connecticut, in which capacity he served until 1969, when he‐. turned to private practice. He became a consultant to the Ford Foundation on criminal Justice and campaigned unsuccessfully on a liberal platform for a seat in the House of Representatives. Named Judge by Nixon Mr. Newman was named a Federal district judge by President Nixon and assumed his duties on Jan. 12, 1972. In his third month on the bench, he ruled as part of a three‐judge panel that the state's ban on elective abortion was unconititutional. In striking down the 1830 state law, Judge Newman wrote that the law was directed at two goals: “inhibition of promiscuous sexual relationships by prohibiting escape from unintentional pregnancy and the protection of pregnant women from the dangers of 19thcentury surgery.“ “However laudable a purpose the goal of reducing the frequency of promiscuous sexual relationships may have been considered 100 years ago, it does not amount to a compelling interest today in the face of changed moral standards,” the judge wrote. “Moreover, advances in medical science since. 1860 have made akortion in the early stages of pregnancy no more dangerous than childbirth,” the decision said. Probably the strongest minority view on Judge Newman's judicial qualities is ‘held by lawyers for the SCM Corporation, a conglomerate that sued the Xerox Corporation for antitrust violations. Last August, after a 14month trial, the longest jury trial ever held in the Federal courts, SCM won jury verdicts for damages of $37 million, which was then reduced to zero by Judge Newman. The landmark case, involving what Richard Sexton, vice president and general counsel of SCM called the judge's “extreme form of judicial legislation,” is being appealed to the Court of Appeals, which will review the case without Judge Newman's participation. With a secretary and two law clerks, Judge Newman will spend about five days a month in New York hearing cases and do most of his deliberations in his chambers in Hartford. He and his wife, Martha, and their three children, Leigh, 22; Scott, 20, and David, 17, live in West Hartford. Off the bench, Judge Newman is an avid skier, golfer and tennis player, and a collector of miniature liqueur bottles. As a reader he alternates between mystery fiction and law books. The New York Times Began his training at the very top of the judicial hierarchy."
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/25/archives/letters-1000-gallons-of-gasoline-per-family-per-year.html,"1,000 Gallons of To the Editor: Recent polls have shown that, a strong‐handed President would be welcomed: a President who could “solve” our problems, including inflation and energy dependency. One response is described by Richard Halloran's June 11 news story predicting a “tough” Presidential demeanor at the Tokyo talks among the industrially advanced countries of Western Europe, North America and Japan. Such a position must strike our trading partners as offensive, ludicrous or both. Sweden, for example, with a standard of living at least comparable with our own, consumes energy at 60 percent of the U.S. rate, and uses half the energy per capita for transportation. Before lecturing those with a better conservation record than our own, our President would do well to ask Congressional leaders to make a final effort to catch up with a public opinion that prefers equitable rationing to regressive price control. Congress might consider (1) that oil is in finite supply while demand is high, growing and ought to be diminished; (2) that no conservation will be totally painless for everyone and (3) that legislation could reduce our dependence on imported oil while making alternative forms of transportation more attractive. Specifically, it should be possible to devise a rationing system that would provide to each family 1,000 gallons of gasoline a year. The increasing readiness of our automobile thanufacturers to employ metric descriptions of engine sizes helps to illustrate the consequences. If the typical traditional‐sized American car has a 6‐liter engine and gets 12 miles per gallon, a 1,000‐gallon allotment would permit 12,000 miles of annual automotive travel. The multicar family would have to use vehicles with smaller engines. Two 3‐liter cars (the X‐chasis GM vehicles; for example) could each travel 10,000 to 12,000 miles on the same 1,000 gallons. Then there are 2‐liter cars (e.g. AlfaRomeo, BMW, Peugeot and Volvo) and 1.5‐liter cars (such as Fiesta, Renault and VW as well as the smaller Hondas, Fiats, Datsuns and Toyotas). One‐ or two‐car households with no appetite for dinosaurs could sell their surplus coupons on a “white market” (run by banks or the Post Office) for resale to salesmen, Texans and Marlboro men. The preliminary metrication (even Canada and the U.K. have metricated; we are the last Tudors) might be sweetened by raising U.S. highway speed limits to 100 kilometers, thereby appeasing the truckers and still leaving us with the lowest speed limits in the automotive world (a fact which in itself poses the question of why we need engines three times the size of others’ luxury sedans). Subsequently, additional possibilities include (1) pegging road‐use taxes to engine size, as every other industrial nation has done for decades, (2) repealing highway construction acts and diverting funds to (3) improving railroad tracks and terminals. Such measures might persuade the O.E.C.D. that we mean to conserve oil supplies and might, even ‘ convince OPEC that we are able to do without them. Alone among our major trading partners, we are able to be self‐sufficient in energy. If our political leaders — Congressional and Presidential fail to act so as to realize that potential, they deserve neither confidence nor our support. K. ROBERT NILSSON Professor of Political Science Dickinson College Carlisle, Pa. June 18, 1979 Leavenworth Jackson Whom the Rulers Of Indonesia Pity To the Editor: There was an Orwellian irony in the report of a statement by an Indonesian delegate to the recent meeting of nonaligned nations in Colombo (news story June 8). The delegate, acting as spokesman for Malaysia and Singapore as well as his own country, reportedly said that the three nations “were united in their condemnation of the wholesale killing of civilians when Pol Pot was in power but nevertheless supported the seating of the Pol Pot delegation because of the manner in which a new government under Heng Samrin was installed in Phnom Penh with the help of Vietnamese soldiers.” I find this extraordinary: The Indonesian Government has never expressed the slightest regret over the massacre of 500,000 of its own citizens in the months follqwing General Suharto's military takeover in 1965. There has been a similar lack of official regret over the tens of thousands of Indonesian political prisoners who, until large‐scale releases began 18 months ago, were all held under appalling conditions, in most cases for more than 12 years without trial. According to Amnesty International, at least 20,000 of these prisoners remain in detention. Nor has the present Indonesian Government shown any qualms over its December 1975 invasion of the former Portuguese colony of East Timor. According to authoritative Catholic sources, tens of thousands of East Timorese have been killed thus far, and these same sources assert that Indonesian atrocities continue. While Jakarta solemnly condemns the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia, it is carrying out a similar exercise in East Timor, in defiance of six United Nations resolutions which called on Indonesia to withdraw its forces from the territory and reaffirmed the right of the East Timorese to determine their own future. Ittlaca, N.Y. June 11, 1979 The Life and Death of Jo Roman To the Editor: It was with considerable sachiest that I read of the death of Jo Roman [news story June 17]. I had been close friends with Jo and Mel Roman in the early years of their marriage. Jo was a creative and vibrant person who assisted many in times of difficulty. I will not argue for or against her action since I am too far removed from the facts and reasoning leading to her untimely demise. I wish to point out that alternatives do exist. There are many counseling programs which seek to help the cancer patient in what is an experience of extreme physical and emotional stress. I have had the good fortune to be part of a project which was initiated by a group of mastectomy patients who sought to share their concerns and feelings and to gain a therapeutic understanding with the help of others who have experienced a grievous injury to themselves and with the assistance of mental‐health professionals. I suggest that your readers reach out to the special programs in many of the mental‐health clinics in the city and the Long Island Cancer Council in the Nassau/Suffolk region. I do not suggest that these programs have the answer or that they can solve the more complex issues involved in the death of Jo Roman. I do affirm that we are not alone and that there are many who live with cancer and remain active in our society. To the Editor: Brava, Jo Roman! The only void in my reaction is that I was not one of her close friends, was not there at the end to embrace her, to toast her great courage. On the first day of spring this year my wife died of cancer. Unlike Jo Roman she went through all the “demeaning” rituals of the medical indus try — removal of part of the colon, months on end of chemotherapy, the horror of 28 days of radiation and the gross indignity of a colostomy in February. She was an intelligent human being. She knew her cancer was terminal and she wanted to die. But there was no procedure available. The entire thrust of the industry's effort was to keep her breathing. And as long as she breathed her pain grew, her body wasted and her mind went through the torture of inadequacy — to make meals, to care for the house, to comfort family and friends with her cheerful common sense. For the first time in her life she was a dependent. The reward for her goodness: Let nature take its course. For what you have done for the cause of self‐determination. Jo Roman, I love you. J. J. HARTIGAN Livingston, N.J. June 17, 1979 Risk/Loss Ratios To the Editor: It seems a great irony that while the Government is willing to take the risk of investing in eapons which the military might never use it is unwilling to spend considerabaly less on Amtrak trains which travelers might never use. As for my tax investments, I'd rather take the chance that people won't ride the trains than that the Government will ever find use for all the missiles it is stockpiling. DAVID C. ALLON Cambridge, Mass. June 18, 1979 Business Education To the Editor: To Clifton Fadiman's perceptive June 13 account of the growing “pop culture” alternative to traditional classroom education, let me add two “traditional “ lessons: (1) The aim of the media‐centered alternative system is to sell, not to educate; therefore (2) we can best learn from it if we understand, in the tradition of the ancient Taoists, that a “liar” does not really lie; he reveals the truth about himself. RICHARD HANAN GREIF New York, June 18, 1979 Boothless Subways To the Editor: The exact‐fare system, an unqualified success on buses, should be applied to the New York subway system. Attractive redesign of subway entrances to 24‐hour, street‐level fare/ exit turnstiles and elimination of token booths would enable personnel to be phased out or redeployed; allow easier, quicker, safer access and movement; rid our urban catacombs of hundreds of cul‐de‐sacs designed to further the muggers’ trade, and remove many beggar and wino gauntlets, (pissoirs?) which the rider must run. Banks and neighborhood businesses could sell tokens, and the public would likely adjust to the changes ouicklv and happily. CORMAC MACCARTAIGH New York, June 18, 1979 A Wrong Hospital‐Church Link To the Editor: Citizens” Committee for Children is grateful to The Times for alerting civic and community groups to the affiliation contract with New York Medical College, proposed by the Health and Hospitals Corporation, to supply all medical services at Lincoln Hospital and Metropolitan Hospital. It appears now that “all medical services” would not include contraceptive information or abortion. New York Medical College, though claiming to be a nonsectarian institution, is completely under the control of the Archdiocese, which has stated that after July 1 abortions will not be performed at the two affiliated hospitals.. We at Citizens’ CoMmittee believe that the Catholic Church has every right to design the services in its own hospitals to fit the beliefs and tenets of its religion. But Lincoln and Metropolitan are municipal hospitals, built with taxpayers’ money and administered by a corporation which is part of New York City's government structure. Abortion is legal in the United States and has been declared a right for all women in‐New York State. That is the only inference to be drawn from the willingness of the Legislature‐to include In the state budget the necessary funding for. Medicaid payments. The corporation states that it will send doctors into Lincoln and Metropolitan to perform abortions. Which doctors will be sent? Where will the corporation find doctors willing to go into a hostile environment to perform an operation or a procedure with no back‐up from the hospital staff? According to The Times's article, corporation doctors were promised to Lincoln Hospital last July but none have appeared and no abortions have been performed. Both municipal hospitals are located in low‐income areas. In East Harlem some 115,000 women in their childbearing years rely on Metropolitan for all their medical care. At Lincoln the numberX are greater — 124,000 women in this age group. For reasons not yet fully understood, the age at which young women conceive has been dropping steadily, and we now find that many prospective mothers are children themselves, some 11 or even 10 years old. Should these children have no alternative to having a baby? If the Archdiocese is unwilling to comply with established policy and with state and Federal law, and if it is unwilling to recognize the rights of all patients, why does it wish to have New York Medical College involved in this affiliation contract? Why does the corporation even consider affiliation which excludes important services to which the patients are entitled.? Citiens’ Committee for Children has an oft‐stated policy endorsing the right of all women to choose whether or not they should have a child. We are therefore opposed to any affiliation contract which denies safe abortion. MARION R. ASCOL1 Chairman, Health Section New York, June 18, 1979"
Archdiocese and a Medical College at Odds,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/26/archives/archdiocese-and-a-medical-college-at-odds-protesting-trustees-say-a.html,"At least two members of/the board of trustees of New York Medical College have resigned in protest and several ohers are considering similar resignalions in a dispute with the Roman ‘Catholic Archdiocese of New York. According to a number of board members, the dispute involves the issue of abortion, charges of nepotism and allegations that the archdiocese has compromised earlier guarantees of maintaining ‘the board's independence and the col3ege's nonsectarian status. • The nonsectarian status of the college, is important becauserit entitles the 100year‐old school to $2.25 million a year in state aid, which under state education law and the State Constitution cannot be given to a sectarian institution. ‘Opportunities for Service’ In return for assuming the fiscal responsibility for a $10 million debt and thus rescuing_ the college from bankrupsion tcy a year ago, Catholic Charities, divi of the archdlocese,, was allowed year ago to appoint 20 of the college's 30 board members. It was also allowed to appoint all five members of a newbody called the Members of the Corporation, which now appoints all board members and which is Said to exercise policy :control over the college's administration. Msgr. Joseph T. O'Keefe, vicar general of the archdiocese, informed pastors throughout the archdiocese at the time that “Catholic Charities has in mind not only the preservation of the largest private medical school in the metropolitan area, but also the opportunities for service to people that 14 Catholic hospitals in the archdiocese might derive from affiliation with the college.” Catholic hospitals, he added, “have long desired a strong affiliation with fine medical college” and “a close relationship between our hospitals and the New York Medical College.” As for training medical students to perform abortions, Monsignor O'Keefe said: “A medical school's unique role is to educate and train students in the protection and defense of life. All medical students, as part of their professional training, must be aware of all medical procedures for the purpose of saving lives.” Despite the designation of a majority of the board's members by Catholic Charities, Msgr. Eugene V. Clark, the director of communications for the archdiocese, contends that the medical college is independent of the archdiocese. “Catholic Charities never has controlled, and does not control, New York Medical College,” he said. However, several board members, who agreed to be interviewed on the condition that they not be identified, contradicted Monsignor Clark. They said the archdiocese maintained “direct control” over the medical college through Msgr. James P. Cassidy, the director of Catholic Charities’ division of health and hospitals. Monsignor Cassidy is also the secretary of the college's board of trustees and bead of the Members of the Corporation, the smaller trustee body. According to several trustees, the appointment of Monsignor Cassidy's brother, Jack, as the chief fiscal officer of the medical college raised questions of nepotism and prompted the recent resignations of two trustees — Fortune Pope, who was chairman of the executive committee of the board of trustees and is the editor and publisher of Il Progresso Italo‐Americano, the Italian‐language newspaper, and Richard V. Giordano, president and chief executive officer of Airco Inc. Monsignor Clark and Mr. Pope could not be reached for comment despite repeated calls to their offices. Mr. Giordano refused to discuss his resignation. Dr. Joseph A. Cimino, the college's president, denied in a statement that the archdiocese “controls” his institution. He also said that “media coverage has emphasized the negative aspects” of the college. Concern by some trustees over whether the archdiocese controls the college reached a critical point after the archdiocese, through Monsignor Clark, denied in a statement last month that it had had anything to do with a decision by the college not to provide abortion services at two of New York City's municipal hospitals. Under an affiliation contract with the New’ York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, the city agency that open ates the municipal hospital system, New York Medical College will continue tc provide medical services at Metropolitan Hospital Center on the Upper East Side and begin providing them at Lincoln Hospital in the South Bronx. The city has similar affiliation contracts with the seven other medical schools here, under which the schools agree to provide medical care in municipal hospitals while the city provides administration and housekeeping. But the city's arrangement with New York Medical College differs from the others. Although there is nothing in writing, the college was said to have told the city that it would not provide abortion services at Lincoln and that it would cease providing abortions at Metropolitan on July 1, when new affiliational contracts take effect at both institutions. No abortions have been performed at Lincoln because medical services there have been provided by the Misericordia Hospital Medical Center, a Catholic hospital in the Bronx and a major teaching affiliate of New York Medical College. For its part, the city said it would have its own physicians provide abortion services at both hospitals and that it would subtract their cost from the contract it had signed with New York Medical College. Hoffman Cites Problems However, Joseph C. Hoffman, the president of the Health and Hospitals Corporation, said in an interview that he had “some problems” with allowing rival pro‐ and antiabortion services to operate side by side in a municipal hospital. Pro‐abortion groups such as Planned Parenthood of New York City and the Citizen's Committee for the Children of New York, saying that they doubted whether abortion services would be adequately provided in the two hospitals, have called on Mayor Koch and the hospitals corporation to provide new assurances that they would. At a meeting of the college's board of trustees last month, the abortion question was raised by several trustees who were members of the ‘board before Catholic Charities became involved with the college. As recounted by several of them recently, they contended in a heated discussion that when the archdiocese negotiated the agreement last year under which it named a majority of the board, also promised to keep the college nonsectarian and free of religious involvement. A similar promise to the State Department of Education also meant that the college would continue to receive state aid. Resignation Weighed One carry‐over board member who said he was considering ‘resigning in protest recalled his argument at the time: “I said I agreed that the archdio. cese was entitled to a major say to protect its investment. But I argued that it was not living up to the original agreement. If this institution is to remain nonsectarian, it must provide training in all the specialties, including abortion. What is going to happen to the students? This is the intrusion of a religious concept and a serious blow to academic freedom and the reputation of this institution.” Another carry‐over trustee, who, like the first, refused to be identified, said that he and the other old board members had been personally assured last year by Monsignor Cassidy, who was also member of the old board, that abortions would continue at Metropolitan Hospital, despite the archdiocese's involvement. They said they felt deceived and were angered by what they said was the monsignor's decision to stop them. “I had no objection to the archdiocese refusing to perform them in a Catholic hospital,” the trustee said. “But this decision involved a municipal hospital, and it disturbed me.” However, both trustees said that when the issue of abortion was raised again last month, Monsignor Cassidy declined to discuss it except to say that the college “would make other arrangements” with the two municipal hospitals involved so that abortions could be performed. Trustee Recalls Warning A trustee appointed by Catholic Chad. ties, who declined to be identified, said, “Right from the beginning I warned the archdiocese that it could not hav,e it both ways with the college — that it could not pretend to be nonsectarian and then prohibit abortions.” Dr. Dorothy Harrison, Deputy State Commissioner of Education, said in an Interview that she had determined last fall that the college was still eligible for state aid despite its involvement with the archdiocese. According to a college official, the school, which was on upper Fifth Avenue before moving to Valhalla, N.Y., 10 years ago, receives $3,000 annually for each of its 750 medical students. Robert Stone, counsel to the department, said that the law governing state aid prohibited it to any institution that Is “under direction or control of a denomination” or that teaches “religious tenets.” He said it had been deteimined that the college was “not controlled” by the archdiocese and that it “did not teach religious tenets.” Nevertheless, Norman Alexander, the chairman of the college's old board of trustees who continued as chairman under the reconstituted board, was said to have declined last year to vouch that the college, under its new relationship with the archdiocese, fulfilled the state's nonsectarian standards and had asked Dr. Cimino to make such a declaration."
‘NEW RIGHT’ CAUSES PRESSED IN SENATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/26/archives/new-right-causes-pressed-in-senate-republican-steering-committee.html,"WASHINGTON, June 25 — Twice in recent months Senator Robert C. Byrd, the majority leader, has taken the floor to denounce ‘a group called the Steering Committee. In unusually harsh tones, Mr. Byrd has described the committee as “shadowy,” “mysterious” and “arcane.” Special to The New York Times The group's chairman, Senator James A. McClure of Idaho, told the Senate that he was grateful for Senator Byrd's remarks. The Steering Committee had been trying to get some attention and shed its “cloak of anonymity,” Mr. McClure said, and now, thanks to the majority leader, “we are not under that cloak any longer.” Pulling away the cloak revealed an unofficial group of conservative Republican Senators who meet, trade notes, plan strategy and finance a four‐person staff that looks after their interests. The door to the committee's Capitol Hill office has no name, just a number, and is not listed on the building's register. But the organization has had considerable impact on the Senate. Capitalizing on what Senator Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee calls a “floodtide of conservatism,” the committee represents the emergence of a New Right, an aggressive call for a return to tradition, packaged in the most contemporary style. Several Recent Bills Blocked In recent years, committee members have helped block several bills favored by labor and consumer groups, and led the fight against the Panama Canal treaties. Last week, they led the opposition against several of President Carter's more liberal nominees to the Federal judiciary and announced a package of amendments to the proposed treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union on limitation of strategic arms. Senator Byrd was aroused by reports that the Steering Committee was misrepresenting itself as an official arm of the Senate. He was also furious that it had helped thwart his attempt to change the Senate rules to make filibusters more difficult. “This crowd is very methodical,” conceded a moderate Republican who usually opposes the committee; “they sit down and plan a campaign and they're good at it. They raise tough questions that have to be answered.” To liberal senators, including some Republicans, the Steering Committee, is dominated by ideologues, right‐wingers who favor confrontation with foreign enemies and ignore the problems of the needy at home. Their only real impact is negative, the argument goes, and by entangling Congress in delaying tactics, they add to its reputation for ineffectiveness and ineptitude. The committee was founded five years ago by Senator McClure and Carl T. Curtis, the former Senator from Nebraska. They were frustrated by the listlessness and disarray of their fellow conservatives after 15 years of liberal domination. As Mr. Curtis has put it: “I got tired of being defeated on the floor. I decided what we needed was a little organization.” Priorities and Assignments The core members, 16 of the 41 Republicans, contribute part of their office space and allowances to support the small staff, but half a dozen other Senators float in and out of the group, depending on the issue., At weekly lunches the membeis discuss pending business, set priorities and assign one of their number to take the lead on specific issues. Senator Jake Garn of Utah has emerged as a leading voice in the debate on the arms limitation treaty, Senator S.I. Hayakawa of California speaks out on educational issues and Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina takes over when the issue is prayer in the schools or abortion. In philosophy, the New Right Senators are bound together by many of the same issues as those of the Old Right: less government and lower taxes, more defense spending and reliance on the private sector. Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah summed up their credo: “We have to get back to basics in this country.” The real difference between the generations is one of tone and style. “The New Right,” said a veteran committee staff member, “embodies a new effort to promote conservative principles. The Old Right had given up.” “They're more activist now,” said Margo Carlisle, the executive director of the Steering Committee. “People used to consider conservatives as protecting the status quo, but the status quo is hardly conservative. We are in favor of change.” Laxalt In Leadership Role If the New Right has a natural leader and spokesman it is probably Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada, who talks easily with friend and foe alike. He was able to lead the opposition to the Panama Canal treaties last year and still retain cordial relations with most of his colleagues. The formal leader of the Steering Committee is Senator McClure, a highly regarded legislator and strategist. He is the leading conservative expert on Senate rules and the man most likely to give the Democratic leadership fits on the floor. Senator McClure concedes that the committee must content itself with marginal gains.‐ A major victory was a successful filibuster against a labor reform bill last year, but often the committee focuses on trying to water down a bill that it has no hope of stopping. Another stratagem is to take the offensive on legislative issues. The best example was the Kemp‐Roth tax cut bill, which made a strong showing last year and helped galvanize budget‐balancing sentiment on Capitol Hill. For now, the conservatives are aiming to “nudge the consensus over a bit to the right,” in Miss Carlisle's words. “Barry Goldwater and those other poor old guys,” Senator Laxalt said, “were always swimming upstream, fighting the political tides of the time. But most of us have been elected since Watergate, the attitude is swinging in the other direction, and we have a lot easier time.”"
The Region,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/27/archives/the-region-us-inquiry-asked-on-suffolk-police.html,"U.S. Inquiry Asked On Suffolk Police Federal action is needed to deal with allegations of police brutality in Suffolk County, the New York Civil Liberties Union said yesterday in calling for an investigation by the Justice Department. Telegrams to Attorney General Griffin B. Bell and Drew Days, head of the department's Civil Rights Division, signed by Dorothy J. Samuels, the Civil Liberties Union's executive director, and Linda Margolin, head of its Suffolk County chapter, said that “the level of police misconduct in Suffolk County exceeds that which is tolerable in a free society.” They said that “persistent efforts” by civil, rights groups over a decade had failed to persuade local public officials “to address the police‐abuse problem in an appropriate manner.” Workmen Repair Raw‐Sewage Hazard The flow of raw sewage into the Hackensack River about a mile upstream from Lake Tappan, a major reservoir straddling the New JerseyNew York state line, was stopped yesterday after workmen installed three rebuilt pumps and motors in a disabled 25-foot-deep sewage‐pumping station in Blauvelt, N.Y. After repairs were completed, the sewage was pumped along its regular pipeline to a treatment plant in Orangeburg, N.Y., where it is processed before being dumped into the Hudson River near the Tappan Zee Bridge, according to a spokesman for Rockland County Sewer District No. 1, the pump's operator. G.O.P. Chief Keeps Connecticut Post STRATFORD, Conn. — Frederick K. Biebel, Connecticut's Republidan state chairman since 1975, was re‐elected without opposition last night to a third two‐year term after efforts to oust him collapsed. The vote of the 70 members of the party's state central committee at the meeting was 66 for Mr. Biebel with four abstentions. Mr. Biebel's replacement had been urged by Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr., and a few other Republicans who contended that the party needed new leadership after its statewide ticket was badly defeated by Gov. Ella T. Grasso and the Democrats last fall. But Mr. Weicker did not directly intervene in the leadership contest and when it became apparent that Mr. Biebel had more than enough votes on the party committee, three other challengers for the chairmanship withdrew. They were James Irwin, a Litchfield management consultant; Hendrik Eleveld, the Windsor town chairman, and Nancy Owen of Glastonbury. Ruling on Abortions TRENTON (AP) — A physician whose negligence deprives a pregnant woman of her right to an abortion is required to pay damages for “wrongful birth” if the child is born defective, the State Supreme Court said yesterday. The court, by a 7‐0 vote, amended 12-year-old ruling that rejected claims for wrongful birth on behalf of a physi- cally deformed infant, because the United States Supreme Court has since established a woman's right to an abortion. By a separate 6‐1 vote, the justices upheld part of the ruling that says a deformed child is not entitled to damages for “wrongful life.” Paul and Shirley Berman of Upper Saddle River alleged that physicians neglected to inform her of a test that would have predicted that their 4-yearold daughter would be born a mongoloid. Mrs. Berman, who was then 38, said she would have had an abortion. The Supreme Court ordered a new trial to assess the amount of damages the Bermans are entitled to if they prove that the physicians were negligent, but the court rejected a claim for expenses neessary to raise their daughter.

"House Again Votes Stringent Limit On Federal Financing of Abortions,",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/28/archives/house-again-votes-stringent-limit-on-federal-financing-of-abortions.html,"WASHINGTON, June 27 — The House of Representatives reaffirmed tonight its position that no Federal funds should be spent on abortions unless the life of the mother would be endangered without such an operation. By a vote of 241 to 180, the members rejected an attempt to write into an appropriation bill the provision in current Federal law, which permits Government financing of abortions in two other circumstances. Several Representatives had planned to offer other amendments to moderate the relatively strong antiabortion position in the financing bill for the Departments of Labor and of Health, Education and Welfare. However, the measure came to the floor today accompanied by a procedural rule that permitted only one amendment, the one offered tonight by Representative David R. Obey, Democrat of Washington, and defeated by a relatively large margin. Language Adopted In 1978 The Obey amendment would also have authorized Federal financing of abortions when they involved “medical procedures necessary for the victims of rape or incest” who have reported the crimes “promptly” to law enforcement or health officials and cases “where severe and long‐lasting physical health damage to the mother could result.” This is the language adopted by a Senate‐House conference late in the 1978 session, and it may yet become the 1979 provision. Historically, the Senate has not taken as strong an anti‐abortion stand as the House. Earlier, the House defeated by voice vote an attempt to strike from the bill the language barring all Government under- writing of abortions “except where the life of th mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term.” The. sponsor, Representative Louis Stokes, Dethocrat of Ohio, was unable to get the necessary 25 votes on the floor to force a roll‐call vote on his Proposal. The provision left intact in the House bill has been sponsored for a number of years by Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois. He lobbied vigorously on the floor tonight in opposition to the Obey amendment. Approved by Smaller Margin In February 1978, the Hyde amendment won House approval by a somewhat smaller margin, 201 to 155. The rule that made the Obey amendment the only substitute for the Hyde language was adopted by the House Rules Committee yesterday without a recorded vote. Some of the panel's more liberal members reportedly said’ that unlimited renewal of the abortion debate on the floor would be fruitless. Defending the rule on the floor earlier today, Representative Robert E. Bauman, Republican of Maryland, said there had been 28 votes on abortion in Congress last year and limiting amendments would avoid the “agony” of the long debates that had preceeded them. In preliminary debate on the restrictive rule, liberal members of both parties urged that it be defeated so other amendments could be presented. But they were too slow in requesting a roll call after the voice vote, and therefor there was no full record of opposition to the limit."
House Puts Off Food Stamp Vote,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/29/archives/house-puts-off-food-stamp-vote.html,"WASHINGTON, June 28 (UPI) — The House of Representatives decided today to delay a vote on authorizing more spending for food stamps until after the July 4 recess. The measure, intended to prevent cutbacks in the food stamp program in August or September, had been scheduled for a vote today but was removed from the agenda after a long debate on the windfall profits tax bill. Earlier, the House approved, by a vote of 327 to 84, a $73.5 billion appropriation for the Department of Health, Education and Welfare after a frenzied debate over prohibiting, payment for abortions. A large majority of House members voted to allow welfare money for abortions only when the mother's life was in danger. After a brief session tomorrow, the House was scheduled to recess until July 9. The food stamp bill would increase the limit on food stamp spending in the 1979 fiscal year by $620 million to $6.8 billion. The Administration had hoped to do away with the ceiling, but the House and Senate Agriculture committees resisted. Congress imposed the limit in 1977 in an effort to control rising spending for food stamps. Spending in this fiscal year is close to the limit in part because of unanticipated inflation in the cost of food. On July 1 benefits will go up by 7 percent in response to increasing food prices. Also, eliminating the cash requirement for getting stamps on Jan. 1 resulted in more new recipients than had been anticipated. From December to March, the number of Americans receiving food stamps increased from 15.9 million to 19.1 million. The new recipients, mostly the very poorest Americans, appear to be heavily concentrated in rural areas. Federal officials have told state governments to be prepared to cut benefits in half in August and September, or to cut them out entirely in September, in the unlikely event that Congress does not act. If the authorization is enacted, Congress still must appropriate the extra money needed for benefits between now and the end of the fiscal year."
"West Expects Soviet Might, And Ms, to Peak in Mid‐80's",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/29/archives/west-expects-soviet-might-and-ills-to-peak-in-mid80s-military.html,"Despite the new strategic arms limitation treaty, the military might of the Soviet Union is expected by intelligence organizations in the United. States and Western countries to peak by the mid1980's. But ‘it is also pre- cisely in that period, the intelligence organization's believe, that Moscow's economic and political problems will become critical. Military Analysis Some analysts believe that the Communist system is incapable of dealing with these problems and that their, growth could lead in time to disintegration of the Soviet Union. Others suggest that the Moscow might be tempted to go to wan when its military advantage has reached its maximum, and before the eroding factors in Soviet society have a serious impact on war‐making ability. In that case, the Soviet leaders would be following the classic pattern of embarking on a foreign adventure to divert their people from internal problems. This portrait of Soviet military power based on an increasingly shaky economic and political base is the result of a series of interviews with senior intelligence officers in Washington, London and at NATO military headquarters in Belgium. Western intelligence services stress the sharp contrast between continued high military spending and accumulation of strategic and conventional arms on one hand and the country's economic and social problems on the other. Soviet Military Structure The picture of the Soviet military structure laid before the defense ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization made these points: 9Soviet military production is well ahead of NATO's: 3,500 tanks annually against 1,500; 3,400 military aircraft to 2,000. gMoscow is also ahead in production of intercontinental missiles, ballistic-missile submarines and supersonic bombers. The United States leads in the number of warheads, but experts estimate that the Soviet Union has twice as much “throw.weight” capability. gThe Soviet Union is replacing two tactical nuclear weapons, code‐named Scaleboard and Scud by NATO, with new missiles for use in Europe, of which the SS‐20 is the forerunner. For a decade, the Soviet Government has devoted 11 to 13 perceiit of gross national product to the military, with 70 percent of that total going to research, development and testing. Behind this glittering facade•of shiny new. weapons is a society beset by industrial, social and nationality prob.’ lems, a society committed to the economic and political values of 1945 in a rapidly changing world. • Slowdown in Industry The central economic problem i8 the slowdown in the growth of industrial production. This is related to problems in the Soviet Union. The Soviet economy grew at ari annual rate of 6 pdcent in the 1950's. A decade later, the figure had fallen to 5 percent. By the mid‐1970's, lt was down to 3.5 percent. For the 1980's, the Central Intelligence Agency forecasts a growth rate of 2.5 percent. Intelligence sources note that Soviet military spending in the last 12 years has grown 4 percent to 5 percent a year. Some put the figure at 6 percent to 7 percent. The slowing of industrial growth has affected oil output. There are ample supplies of oil in Eastern Siberia, but specialists in this field expect a drop in production between 1980 and 1985. The expectation is that the Soviet Union will enter the oil market as a buyer in that period but” that its purchases will be limited by an unwillingness to push foreign spending beyond 30 percent of export earnings. Two kinds of population change will continue to affect the Soviet economy. The first and most obvious is a sharp slowdown in the growth of the Soviet labor force. From 1970 to 1975, the working‐age population increased by just over percent annually. Since 1975, the increase has been about 1.5 percent and the intelligence forecast is that from now until 1995 the working population will grow ai a rate of about half a percent =magi/. Losses From War and Purges The decline is ascribed to the huge military and civilian losses in World War II and the death toll in Stalin's purges. Easy access to birth control devices and to abortion has kept families small. The reservoir of peasants and women who reinforced the work force in the 1950's has dried up. Incentive plans to lure women back to the factories have not been a success. With Soviet agriculture staggering from crisis to crisis, no more peasants can be drawn away. A second population change, this one dealing with the ethnic composition of the Soviet people, could have a severe effect on political stability as well as economic output. Today, slightly more than half of the total population is Russian. But bir# rates among the Russians are low while those in the eight Moslem republics and autonomous regions to the south are rising. Between 1980 and 1985, experts predict the Russian population will fall by about two million while that of the Moslem areas will rise by nine million."
Justices Facilitate Challenge To Evidence in Convictions,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/29/archives/justices-facilitate-challenge-to-evidence-in-convictions-rights.html,"WASHINGTON, June 28 — The Supreme Court today eased the test that state prisoners have to meet to persuade Federal judges that their convictions were based on insufficient evidence. In a 5-to-3 decision, the Court abandoned a 19-year-old standard that made a conviction sustainable if there was any evidence at all to justify the verdict of guilty. Instead, the majority held that a Federal court, in deciding on a state prisoner's application for a writ of habeas corpus, “must consider not whether there was any evidence to support a state court conviction, but whether there was sufficient evidence to justify a rational trier of the facts to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” The previous standard, Associate Justice Potter Stewart wrote for the majority, is “simply inadequate” to enable a Federal court to make sure that a defendant's constitutional rights were sot violated at his trial. Rights Even fora Thief “The question whether a defendant has been convicted upon inadequate evidence is central to the basic question of guilt or innocence,” Justice Stewart wrote. “The constitutional necessity of proof beyonda reasonable doubt is not confined to those defendants who are morally blameless. Under our system of criminal justice even a thief is entitled to complain that he has been unconstitutionally convicted and imprisoned as a burglar.” Today's case, Jackson v. Virginia (No. 78‐5283), was an appeal by a man convicted of first‐degree murder. Under Virginia law, that crime requires proof of premeditation. He admitted that he had killed the victim but argued that his intoxicated condition made it legally impossible for him to have formed the required specific intent to kill. He lost his argument both at trial and on direct appeal in the Virginia state courts. He then challenged the constitutionality of his conviction through a Federal court petition for habeas corpus. The Federal District Court, applying the old standard of review, found that there had been no evidence at all of premeditation and overturned the conviction. The Federal appeals court, also applying the old standard, found that there was some evidence and reinstated the conviction. But the appeals court expressed doubt about whether the old standard was still valid, noting that in a 1970 case called In re Winship the Supreme Court had held for the first time that proof beyond a reasonable doubt was constitutionally required in a criminal trial. Two Standards at Issue The question for the Court today, then, was whether In re Winship had in effect Overruled the old “any evidence” standard expressed in a 1960 decision, Thompson v. Louisville. Eight states joined Virginia in urging the Justices to retain Thompson v. Louisville as the standard. They argued that In re Winship applied only to the requirement of proof at trial and not standards of Federal court review of state criminal convictins. Further, the states argued that adop. tion of a reasonable doubt standard of review would cause the Federal courts to Intrude unnecessarily into the work of state courts and would increase the burdens on Federal judges by encouraging even more prisoners to file habeas corpus petitions. Justice Stewart”s majority opinion today was joined by Associate Justices William J. Brennan Jr., Byron R. White, Thurgood Marshall and Harry A.Blackmun. Associate Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. did not take part. Stevens, Burger and Rehnquist The dissent was written by Associate Justice John Paul Stevens and joined by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Associate Justice William H. Rehnquist. The dissenters wrote that In re Winship bad “nothing to do with appellate, much less habeas corpus, review standards.” They said there was “no necessary connection between the rule recognized in Winship and the rule invented by the Court today” and warned that today's decision “will surely impose countless additional hours of unproductive labor on Federal judges and their assistants.” The majority opinion said this fear was “exaggerated.” The reasonable doubt standard, the majority said, “will expand the contours of this type of claim, but will not create an entirely new class of Federal habeas cases.” One ‘criminal law specialist, Barbara Underwood of the Yale Law School, said today that a typical habeas corpus petition was almost never confined solely to the argument that the evidence was insufficient; it is much more commonly based on arguments about procedural deficiencies at the trial, misbehavior of the prosecutor, inadequate legal help and the like, she said. Professor Underwood said that while today's ruling might lead prisoners to put more stress on their insufficient evidence arguments, it would probably not greatly increase either the number of petitions or the effort required of Federal judges in dealing with them. The opinion has even less impact on the prisoner in the case, James Jackson. The Justices ruled that even under the reasonable doubt standard, there was enough evidence to convict him of firstdegree murder. The Supreme Court will conclude its current term on Monday by handing down seven opinions. Among the cases are those involving school desegregation in two Ohio cities, a Massachusetts requirement that teen‐agers get their parents’ consent for an abortion and a New York court decision permitting judges to close most pretrial hearings to the press."
Court Temporarily Bars New Law In Missouri Restricting Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/02/archives/court-temporarily-bars-new-law-in-missouri-restricting-abortion.html,"JEFFERSON CITY, Mo., July 1 (AP) - A Federal judge has temporarily barred Missouri from enforcing new restrictions on abortions signed into law on Friday by Gov. Joseph P. Teasdale. Federal District Judge Elmo Hunter issued the restraining order after a hearing yesterday at which a lawyer, Frank Stamen, argued that the new law was unconstitutional. Judge Hunter scheduled another hearing on the issue for Aug. 6. The law required women under the age of 18 to get the consent of at least one parent or a court before an abortion could be performed. It also required women to give their written consent for abortion after the physician had given a detailed explanation of alternatives. As he signed the measure on Friday, Governor Teasdale called the law an affirmation by the Legislature of the respect they have for life.”"
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/02/archives/letters-before-the-healthplan-plunge.html,"To the Editor: Helen Eleasari has a very valid point in her letter of June 24. She intimates that by studying the health‐care systems in Britain, Israel and the Scandinavian countries we ought to avoid egregious and expensive errors in creating an effective system for the United States. To her list of examples to be studied, I should add certain of the Canadian provinces. But my chief contention is that we have no business. plunging into Federal health legislation, massive both in design and implication, until we have methodically and quantitatively studied our existing system such as it is. Unsatisfactory though it be, it is not all bad. Yet one can, by injudicious and ill‐informed legislative action, make it worse. The sort of study I envisage would, by meticulous sampling in representative areas of the country, define case by case very precisely what happens, beginning to end, when individuals fall ill or meet with accident and, sooner or later, seek health care. The information thus gained would for the first time permit the construction of an accurate quantitative picture of the American health‐care system, and this in turn would be subject to scrutiny by fully qualified authorities, both medical and non‐medical. The strengths and defects of our system would then become apparent, and the design of legislation could at long last solid information than guesswork and political. whim. The sort of examination I envisage would take perhaps five years and would be expensive. But its total cost would be minute compared with the cost Federal health care would impose on the taxpayer, especially if Senator Kennedy's bill is passed. I submit that neither Senator Kennedy nor President Carter really knows what he is doing. Of the two proposals, the President's is preferable because there can be little argument about the need to protect Americans from the cost of catastrophic illness. But of even greater ‘importance, it will permit the gathering of muchneeded information and analysis as the plan is implemented step by step. I am well aware that political considerations and dogma, ,rather than solid information, have in the past determined the size and shape of most health legislation. I am also aware that a five‐year research project of the sort I have suggested is not likely to be welcomed by Congress or the executive branch because so few Federal officals know in advance that they will remain in office that long. But to design legislation without making a serious effort to collect adequate information on which to base the design seems to me to be irresponsible. And in this regard Senator Kennedy is the major offender. CARLETON B. CHAPMAN. M.D. President, The Commonwealth Fund New York, June 25, 1979 To the Editor: The risk that some individual will be struck by fragments of Skylab when it lands in July appears to be about one in several hundred, and the risk that a specified individual will be killed is probably only about one in several hundred billion. Some people are seriously concerned about this risk. In his letter to The Times (June 21) Professor Turkevich urged that efforts be made to destroy or break up Skylab into smaller fragments before it lands. Skylab is circling the earth from west to east at intervals of about 90 minutes, at a height of about 150 miles. It is moving closer to the earth on each circuit, because of the resistance of the atmosphere. Fragments will strike the earth within a band several hundreds of miles long, somewhere between 50 degrees north and 50 degrees south latitude. The exact location of the landing area cannot be predicted until less than a day before impact. All risk of being struck by Skylab can be avoided by going to a point outside the region of possible impact, that is, to a point in Canada further north than 50 degrees or to a point in Chile, Argentina or Antarctica further south than 50 degrees. But since the present risk of a fatal accident when driving by automobile in this country is about one in 100 million per mile traveled, the risk of driving to escape would be much greater than the risk of staying at home. A simpler way to escape all risk from Skylab would be to station oneself for a few hours on the east side of mountain or small hill. Such a hill would provide excellent protection. THEODORE DUNHAM JR. Cambridge, Mass., June 22,1979 • To the Editor: I am reassured by NASA's statement (June 23) that the odds are only one in 600 billion that I — “a specific person” — will be hit by a chunk of Skylab. But what about Chicken Little and nonspecific persons? PAUL THEAD Tinton Falls, N.J., June 23, 1979 To the Editor: Catholic hospitals have a tradition of particularly warm, tender and expert care of the sick and injured of New York. Catholic Charities is now seeking to develop these institutions into a system of teaching hospitals by integration with New York Medical College. At the same time the very special needs of Lincoln and Metropolitan Hospitals can be met magnificently by the revitalization of New York Medical College by Catholic Charities. The singular and to my mind false issue of abortion threatens divisively here, as it does on the broader political scene. Accommodation can be made and is offered. Catholic Charities deserves its chance to further its mission in medical excellence and care. JOSEPH DEUEL SULLIVAN, M.D. New York, June 26, 1979 To the Editor: It would save hundreds of thousands of gallons of gasoline every day if New York City taxis not on call were parked at conveniently located taxi stands. They used to do so, and they should be required to do it again. WARREN P. MUNSELL New York, June 22, 1979 To the Editor: Cost containment of health care is possible if medical schools include medical economics and medical administration in their curriculums. Today's graduates of medical‐school and specialized training are taught to function in the milieu of an expensive technology and a medical bureaucra- cy. They are unequivocally naive when confronted with the costs of health care. This lack of business preparation contributes directly to rising costs. Ancillary personnel profit, parasitize, and prosper from this ineptness. Elegant office suites, extraneous equipment, irrelevant medical meetings and other notions, gimmicks and frills are sold to gullible physicians. Many physicians do not know the costs of the services they render. This presents opportunities for fraud and other insurance rip‐offs. Insensitivity to the size of a patient's medical bill exists for the same reason. Expense used to be no object in the treatment of disease. Today we have the $200 X‐ray study, the $200-a-day hospital bed and the $200 laboratory workup. A different priority is present. Cost can no longer be considered a minor consideration by the fulltime medical school faculties in their teaching and practice. Properly oriented physicians will be effective in containing and controlling the costs of health care. Surgery could be taught not only as an anatomical and physiological exercise but also as an economic problem for the patient, the hospital and the surgeon himself. Specifically, physicians must be instructed in the elements of the following topics: accounting, medical business administration and hospital administration, the health‐insurance industry (both public and private), the costs of a medical practice and medical equipment, the economics of medical institutions and foundations and the economics of the pharmaceutical industry. In the early part of this century we needed to develop both the scientific approach to disease and the scientific physician. Now, at the end of the century, we need physicians who have been prepared for the economic responsibility of our advances. F. JAMES WHALEN. M.D. Rawlins, Wyo., June 22, 1979 Jacqueline Chwast To the Editor: Somewhere between June 14 and June 16, in the final days before adjournment of the 1979 session, the New York State Legislature made a costly mistake when it removed the $1.5 million allocation for high school equivalency programs for adults from the supplemental budget. New York State currently has 4.9 million adults without a high school diploma. Of these only 20,000 are able to enroll in a high school equivalency program because the state allocates only $2 million for the high school education of 4.9 million adults (roughly 90 cents per eligible adult). This year the Regents requested an additional $1.5 million for the equivalency program to be included in the Legislature's supplemental budget. This money would have amounted to just 1/100th of the entire supplemental budget but would have given 15,000 more adults an opportunity to obtain their high school diplomas. But obviously the Legislature felt was more important to provide $1.6 million for the leasing of a state helicopter than $1.5 million to give 15,000 adults an opportunity for self-improvement and thus to become additional or greater contributors to the economy of the state. In a recent national survey of males 25 to 34 years of age, the assessed costs to society of not educating the public through the high school level were: $237 billion in forgone income throughout their lifetime; $71 billion tax cost to the Federal Treasury; $24 billion to state and local tax treasuries. The cost of education through high school would have been $40 billion. Net loss: $200 billion. In addition, high school non-cornpleters cost $2 billion of the $8 billion spent in the criminal justice system and $698 million in unemployment compensation was directly attributed to undereducation of the unemployed. All the high school equivalency programs requested of the members of the Legislature was a paltry $1.5 million, which they could not find for them. FLORINE LEVIN New York, June 23, 1979 The writer is president of the New York Association for Continuing/ Community Education. To the Editor: Reactions to the Joan Baez letter about human rights in Vietnam assume that we who were active in the antiwar movement, and also signed the letter, have dramatically changed our minds about Vietnamese Communism. Some correspondents suggest that if we had recognized 10 years ago what, we recognize now we would have supported the war. Others, coworkers of ours in the antiwar movement, believe that by pandering to shallow anti-Communism we encourage Americans to learn nothing from the Vietnamese nightmare and make it more likely that there will be new Vietnams in, say, South Africa or the Near East. I believe Vietnamese Communism, like Communism in the Soviet Union, China and Cuba, has improved life for the majority of the people while repressing minorities. By minimum estimates, tens of thousands have been detained without trial. Comparable numbers, apparently mostly middleclass persons of Chinese background, have become boat people. However great the American contribution to the hardships of Vietnamese reconstruction, there must be a more humane policy than that which sends these refugees Sorth, often to their deaths. My own concern about these matters is not new. In 1967 1 declined to join Lord Russell's War Crimes Tribunal because, while believing that American war crimes far exceeded those of any other party, I felt that such a tribunal should be open to tiny evidence of any alleged crimes by any side. However, knowing what the out- come has been, I would again oppose the Vietnam War, and would oppose American involvement in any similar future war elsewhere. As we heard again and again from returning servicemen, regardless of their position on the war, the people of South Vietnam opposed the American presence. Precisely because those whom we purported to help were united against us, the American Government resorted to weapons which destroyed indiscriminately, like napalm, B‐52 bombing and fragmentation bombs. Why is it inconsistent to have opposed napalm in the 1960's and to oppose detention without trial now?

Parental Consent Law on Abortion Is Struck Down,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/03/archives/parental-consent-law-on-abortion-is-struck-down-deficiencies-in.html,"WASHINGTON, July 2 - The Supreme Court today declared unconstitutional Massachusetts law that required unmarried minor girls to get the approval of their parents or a judge before being able to obtain a legal abortion. me 8-to-1 ruling was a setback for those opposing abortion who have been pressing for such laws in state legisla- tures across the country. Governor Carey vetoed a• parental consent law in New York in 1976, days before the Supreme Court struck down a similar statute in Missouri. The setback could well'be only tempo- rary, however. A majority of the Court appeared to endorse an arrangement under which a state judge could declare girl mature enough to make a decision on her own. If found immature, the judge could decide whether an abortion was in the girl's best interest. PresuMably, state legislatures are now free to enact such an arrangement with relative assurance that it would be found'constitutional. For that reason, today's opinion, Bellotti v. Baird (No. 78‐329), is likely to be only the latest chapter in the Court'S effort to deal with the continuing ramifications of its 1973 decision that a woman has a constitutional right to abortion. The Massachusetts law, enacted in 11974, required a girl under the age of 18 to ‘obtain the consent of both parents to get an abortion. If one or both withheld consent, the girl could ask a state Superior Court judge for a special order allowing her to get the operation. A Federal District Court enjoined enforcement of the law in 1975, and the state ‘ appealed to the Supreme Court. Eight Justices agreed today that the I law was unconstitutional, but no single analysis commanded a majority. Associate Justice Lewis F. Powell announced the Court's judgment in an opinion that was joined by‐three of his colleagues, Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Associate Justices Potter Stewart and William H. Rehnquist. The Court said that a state can constitutionally put some limits on a minor's right to abortion as long as the state recognizes that some “mature minors” are capable of making the decision on their own. But the Massachusetts law was defi- :ient, the Justices said, both because it required all minors • to seek parental consent before going., to a judge and because it created no exception for the so- called “mature minors.” . Justice Powell said, “Every minor must have the opportunity - if she so desires - to go directly to a court without first consulting or notifying her parents. If she satisfies the court that she is mature and well‐informed enough to make intelligently the abortion decision on her own, the court must authorize her to act.” If the judge finds that the girl is not “mature,” the opinion continued, he is to authorize the abortion if persuaded that it is in her best interest and refuse to authorize it if it is not in her best interest. Four other Justices, while agreeing with the judgment of unconstitutionality, said that ‘Justice Powell's description of the kind of law that would be consitutional was an “advisory opinion” of the sort the Court usually shuns. Associate Justice John Paul Stevens - joined by Associate Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, and Harry A. Blackmun - said that he would have declared the Massachusetts law unconstitutional as “potentially even more restrictive” than the Missouri law the Court struck down three years ago. That law gave an absolute veto to the parents, without recourse to a judge. Giving the’ final veto to a judge, these four Justices said, did not cure the constitutional defect. The sole dissent was by Associate Justice Byron R. White. “Until now,” he said, “I would have thought inconceivable a holding that the United States Constitution forbids even notice to parents when their minor child who seeks surgery object to such notice.” Special to The New York Times"

He said the effect of. the proposed guidelines “would be to withhold public funding for one medically necessary procedure and only one, the abortion to protect a woman's health.” The proposed guidelines followed standards for public financing of abortions contained in the Federal so‐called Hyde amend- ment, which says that such abortions can be carried out if the life of the mother is endangered, if the pregnancy is the result of incest or rape, or if there could be severe and long‐lasting damage to the woman's health if the fetus is carried to full term."
Carey Ponders Maternity Rights for Public Employees,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/04/archives/carey-ponders-maternity-rights-for-public-employees-unusual.html,"ALBANY,July 3 - Governor Carey's administration is split over a measure that would require both state and local governments to give maternity benefits to employees, their ‘spouses and their depndents. Carey Ponders Maternity Rights for Public Employees The bill is opposed by the Office of Employee Relations, which argues that such benefits should be negotiated at the contract bargaining table, not granted through legislation. It is designed to extend to the public employees insurance requirements that now apply only to the private sector. The bill would require the government to pay medical costs estimated at $1,000 to $1,200 in maternity cases. The cost of the bill to the state and to local governments is estimated by state officials at $4 million to $16 million annually. Unusual Alliance Supports Bill The measure is supported by State Attorney. General Robert Abrams and coalition that includes both women's rights groups and state legislators opposed to abortion. “I am of the opinion that this bill will not have the kind of fiscal impact on local government that the ‘doomsayers’ predict,” said Senator James H. Donovan, Republican‐Conservative of Chadwicks and the lead sponsor of the bill in the Senate. Mr. Donovan, a leading abortion foe, finds himself in the unusual alliance with liberals and women's groups in support of the measure. According to the bill's supporters, it is needed to bring the state into line with Federal civil rights law forbidding discrimination because of pregnancy. In a statement released today, Mr. Abrams said it would be a violation of Federal law for the state or any other public employer “to refuse to cover their employees for maternity health care since they do provide thorough coverage for other illnesses.” Aides to the Governor said he had not made up ids mind on the issue, but he had a way out if he wanted to veto the bill. According to the aides, Federal law requires that maternity benefits be given to employees and their spouses, but not to their dependents. The bill includes dependents in its requirements - an extra benefit Mr. Carey might reasonably oppose, the aides said. Meanwhile, the Governor signed score of bills today, including one that regulates the troubled check‐cashing industry. The bill sets up a comprehensive regulatory plan for check‐cashing companies, which are particularly important operations in poor and minority areas in New York City. Under the bill, the state Banking Department is charged with regulating the companies."

Army in Europe Has Family and Housing Problems,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/06/archives/army-in-europe-has-family-and-housing-problems-unable-to-pack-up.html,"BAUMHOLDER, West Germany —The United States Army in Europe is facing serious, and unanticipated, social problems: high rates of pregnancy among women soldiers and the financial and emotional difficulties afflicting the growing number of dependents living abroad. Army officials in Heidelberg, Baumholder and other troop commands make it plain that those problems now overshadow such difficulties of the early 1970's as drug abuse, racial tension and crime. Moreover, the current problems are, in the words of Army officers, both gnawing and delicate, and they are especially complicated because they touch the roots of the volunteer force, whose future is once again being debated in Congress. The number of pregnancies’ among enlisted women in the Seventh Army in West Germany is sizable, but there is some uncertainty as to just how severe the effects of the problem are. “Pregnancy is, most certainly, a problem,” said Brig. Gen. William H. Fitts, chief of personnel for the United States Army in Europe, echoing the Views of many officers in Germany as well as within the Defense Department. In a major field exercise last winter in Germany, for example, the Army learned that numerous women were unable to pack up and leave their home bases because they were either pregnant or ailing for small children. Estimates vary, but some personnel officers say that anywhere from 10 to 20 percent, and possibly far more, of the 13,000 Army women in West Germany are pregnant at any one time. How many are married, how many single, how many decide to have a child and take the option of leaving the Army and how many choose to have abortions is unclear. Of 20 women in a military police company in Baumholder, for instance, nine have become pregnant since Octo. ber. Two of them are married. Restrictions supported by the Carter Administration bar most abortions at Government expense. One of the young women flew to London for an abortion, at a cost of $1,000, and another woman had an operation in West Germany. The others are waiting to give birth. “About 10 percent of our women are pregnant and, yes, it's a problem,” said Brig. Gen. Frederick J. Brown, the Baumholder commander. “I don't think it's any more of a problem, though, than with males not present for duty. Practically speaking, the women work as late as they possibly can.” One ranking defense official conceded that there was “no coherent body of policy” on pregnancy and said that the Army lacked specific evidence that pregnant servicewomen on “sick call” posed greater problems than men failing to show up for work. “Certainly there's a difference,” the official said, “between a pregnant woman who's a typist, and who can work up to the end, and a woman who's a line handler on a tugboat.” Several sergeants and junior officers in Baumholder and Kaiserslautern said, however, that pregnancy among servicewomen was taking its toll in offices and motor pools and that the problems it caused for the Army — shifting women into less taxing jobs, absences over longer periods of time, the inability of women to go to the field — posed more serious difficulties than men calling in sick. Officially, a woman is given six weeks’ medical leave after having a child. But, according to Army officers, medical problems often arise in the weeks and months leading up to birth, resulting in the women's taking time off from their jobs in administrative offices, repair shops, motor pools, hospital facilities and kitchens. “It's no way to run an army”, said warrant officer in Kaiserslautern, the headquarters of the 21st Support Command, the Army's major supply center. “When our gals get pregnant, we don't know from day to day if they're going to show up.” The Army currently has only a minimal education program for women—and men‐on averting pregnancy and on the problems facing single parents abroad. However, the Army and Defense Department are now planning a major education campaign involving pregnancy aimed at women, and are weighing plans to increase the availability of contraceptives. Under recent Army directives, those single parents who seek to remain in the military must guarantee that a qualified adult can take over and care for their children in a crisis or an alert. Otherwise, the mother or father is discharged. “The Army is not in the baby business; it's not in the marriage business,” said Capt. Paula Scott, the personnel officer at Baumholder. “The thought of combining a military career and being a mother is mindboggling to me,” said Captain Scott, who is married to an infantry officer. “The Army, in Germany, has alerts, you're always on call, and I just think it would be a tremendous strain to try to be a mother under those conditions.” Currently about 6.7 percent of the force in Europe is female, as against about percent of the total force. By 1982, the Pentagon expects the percentage of women in the armed forces to climb to 12 percent. The next most pressing personnel problem facing the volunteer Army, officials say, is the growing number of civilian dependents in Europe, 175,000 at present. It is another problem that the Army failed to anticipate. Essentially the volunteer Army, unlike the draft Army, is a married force. More than 30 percent of the 18- and 19‐year‐olds in their first enlistment are married, which may be triple the figure for the draft Army. And many of the young soldiers have children. In many ways the young married soldier is what officers and ranking sergeants term the ideal G.I.: hardworking, motivated and less prone to alcoholism, which is now a more serious problem than drugs. However, the young married soldier is under considerable strain. Housing shortages on military bases around West Germany are forcing thousands of lowergrade enlisted men and their families to “live on the economy,” off‐base. Because the value of the dollar has plunged more than 30 percent over the last three years, straining paychecks, and because young enlisted men often must go 10 or 15 miles away from their bases to find apartments, increased marital difficulties and depression among Army wives have stirred concern in the Army hierarchy and set off a debate about the efficacy of the threeyear tour for enlisted people and their dependents. “These young girls come here, and they don't have a car, don't know the language, have a baby and are totally isolated,” said Capt. Lewis E. Gallant, social worker and the Army's community services worker in Baumholder, which has 10,000 soldiers, the largest concentration of American combat troops in West Germany. “We get an awful lot of marital problems, three or four separation agreements, or at least questions about it, each day,” said Lieut. Col. Michael A. Haas, the Judge Advocate General in Baumholder. Those living off‐post sometimes encounter chilly, even hostile, treatment from their German neighbors, according to several soldiers and their wives. “The Germans are just very cold to us, not particularly friendly,” said Specialist 5 Michael Thomas, who lives with his wife and 8‐month‐old daughter in a oneroom, $200‐a‐month apartment near Kaisersalutem. “My wife is taking it in her stride, but we're both a little sick and tired of it here.” Even those enlisted men and their wives who are accustomed to the difficulties of military life complain bitterly that the Army and Air Force left them totally unprepared for, the cramped quarters given to enlisted people in Europe. “I just couldn't believe what they gave us,” said Natalie Penn, the wife of an Army staff sergeant and the mother of two small children. “I cleaned these small rooms every morning and got totally depressed. My husband was away from 5 in the morning to 6:30 at night. just sat in the house for six months and ate and ate and gained 35 pounds.” Seated beside her in a mess hall in Kaiserslautern., Helga Betsar, the German‐born wife of an Air Force sergeant, and mother of three children, said ‘quietly: “I started to drink. I just couldn't handle it. What they gave us was awful. Everything was incredibly expensive. The Germans, my own people, were rude. I had nothing to look forward to. “I went down to 88 pounds,” she added. “My husband and oldest boy took me to psychiatrist on the base. He gave me some valium and told me to get a job.” The two women, as well as several other wives of enlisted men, are now working for the Army, too, painting and spraying and overhauling jeeps, tanks and trucks. At a tank range near Baumholder, Sgt. Robert Riese, a 22‐year‐old gunner and driver who lives in Wiesbaden with his wife and year‐old daughter, noted that he earned, before taxes, $915 a month. He pays about $300 a month for a three‐anda‐half‐room apartment and is burdened with heavy car insurance and utility bills. “We cut it very close,” he said. “No movies, nq luxuries, nothing like that. It's hard for my wife too. She doesn't speak the language. Can't communicate. Has the baby to watch. And we'll be here 16 days now in the field.” “ A lot of soldiers, a lot of wives, are simply very depressed here,” said John Starr), a civilian psychiatrist who works for the military in Kaiserslautern. “For older women, too, it's very difficult here. The kids grow up. The husband moves a lot and and works very hard. She comes to a strange place like this asking herself where is she in her life. “You get a lot of women saying, ‘I'm only a dependent,’ putting themselves down like that,” he said. “When she tries to do something - hold a job, further her education - it's difficult because her husband moves. Resentments build. The pressures on women, on Army families, are acute, and getting more so.” An American Army family in Germany whose financial and social problems are made more severe by the shrinking value of the dollar."

The Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/08/archives/the-nation-in-summary-a-refusal-and-a-hedge-in-courts-abortion.html,"Since 1973, when the United States Supreme Court ruled that a woman has a constitutional right to abortion, the court has been telling states how far they can go in attempts to narrow the impact of that ruling. Last week came the latest round of instruction. The court declared unconstitutional, 8‐1, a Massachusetts requirement that an unmarried minor who wants a legal abortion must first obtain the approval of a judge or her parents. However, a majority seemed to support the position that if, in the view of state judge, a girl was not “mature” enough to make such a decision independently, the judge could decide if an abortion was in her best interest. The ‘High Court's lead may be followed in short order in states where anti‐abortion sentiment is strong, many authorities believe. Nonetheless, a spokesman for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops and the United States Catholic Conference called the ruling “a grave blow to human rights and family relationships.” In other decisions, the court: Upheld, 6‐3, a lower court finding that gives the American Indians of the Pacific Northwest the right to catch up to half the Puget Sound salmon run. Attorneys for the Indians and the United States Government argued successfully that treaties struck in 1854 and 1855 had given the fewer than 1,000 eligible Indian fishermen the right to share the catch equally with some 6,000 commercial fishermen who weren't Indian. The Washington State Supreme Court had held earlier that interpretting the old treaties in that manner violated the equal‐protection rights of non‐Indian fishermen. The dispute has been rancorous and for a time a Federal District Court judge ‘has supervised salmon fishing in Washington state. • Held, 5‐4, that Federal courts can overturn state court convictions if the grand jury that originally indicted defendant was selected in a racially discriminatory procedure. The case stemmed from an appeal by two inmates who had been charged with murder by a Tennessee county grand jury that had never been chaired by a black. But the court decided, 7‐2, that the defendants — who were subsequently convicted of killing two people in a 1972 armed robbery — should remain in prison. Refused to review a lower‐court ruling and thus allowed to stand President Carter's authority to withhold Federal contracts from firms that violate wage‐price guidelines. Bias and/or Bribery Trial in Cleveland George L. Forbes, President of the Cleveland City Council, went on trial last week in a kickback case muddied by allegations of racial persecution. Mr. Forbes, the city's leading black office‐holder, has acknowledged accepting $4,000 from carnival operators seeking permits to run their games in Cleveland neighborhoods. However, his defense attorney said last week, he gave the money to charity and “never kept a dime for his own purposes.” Lewis H. Thompson, a former partner in a carnival operation, testified that Mr. Forbes had received much more than $4,000. Mr. Thompson said he had delivered up to $11,000 to the Council President over two years. Supporters outside the courtroom have seemed less concerned with the amount and disposition of the money than with what some have called “selective prosecution.” Such payments are common in Cleveland ward politics, they contend, but of the six councilmen scheduled for trial in the “carnival scandal,” only one is not black. Forbes sympathizers range from the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, who says the indictments are part of a national conspiracy to credit black officials, to the local equivalent of the Chamber of Commerce, which shares the Council President's antipathy for Mayor Dennis J. Kucinich. Last week, Mr: Kucinich got through the City Council an emergency measure giving the city another year to repay $7.6 million it borrowed from its own agencies. The action averted another default of the kind that brought hostilities between the Mayor and Mr. Forbes to the fore last December. California Inquiry Widens Its Scope Chief Justice Rose Bird of the California Supreme Court last week avoided the possibility of a contempt citation by deciding to answer questions about memorandums prepared by her staff. The fact that the issue arose points up a difficulty for Miss Bird. Having asked that the Commission on Judicial Performance investigate the court's handling of decisions, and having promised to cooperate fully, she is now openly unhappy with the scope and methods of the inquiry. Miss Bird and her staunchest ally on the court, Justice Mathew 0. Tobriner, contend that the commission has exceeded its bounds by questioning justices about their state of mind and personal feelings concerning certain decisions. Such matters seem to be at the heart of the court's divisiveness. Last week, the Chief Justice replied “no comment” when a commission attorney asked whether she had received, but not turned over to the commission, staff memorandums concerning leaks to the press. A few days later she replied in writing that such documents existed, but that they had been prepared at the request of her lawyers for future, presentation and were therefore part of a privileged “work product.” That satisfied the commission for the moment, but shed no new light on questions being investigated. One is whether the court delayed announcing a sensitive gun‐law decision until after last November's state election, in which Miss Bird was up for voter confirmation. Another is whether any justice cooperated with reporters who broke the details of the story on election day. Justice William Clark, a Bird adversary, told the commission last week that he had received a call from a Los Angeles Times reporter about the case, but had neither confirmed nor denied the account subsequently published. He denied that he felt any “political bias” toward Miss Bird or that he tried to “trap” her, as she has contended. Chief Bounced In San Francisco A riot by homosexuals on May 21 thrust a tough choice upon San Francisco's Police Chief, Charles Gain. Crowds protesting a manslaughter verdict in the killing of Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk, a homosexual, were battling policemen, stoning City Hall and burning cars. His options: To let the violence run its course or use extra force. Chief Gain backed off and it has proved his undoing. Mayor Dianne Feinstein, who had supported his action during the violence, last week asked the Police Commission to get his resignation, effective next Jan. 8, the day a new Mayor takes office. She noted somewhat apologetically that the Chief was “not getting the kind of respect that is necessary” from his subordinates. That was putting it mildly. Last month, the Police Officers Association voted no confidence in the chief, 1,081 to 22. Derogatory T‐shirts and bumper stickers (Our Gain Is Your Loss) have become hot items. Dan White, the former supervisor convicted of the Moscone and Milk shootings, was sentenced last week to seven years and eight months, the maximum for manslaughter. After New Tests, DC‐1 O's May Fly The Federal Aviation Administra tion last week ordered a new round of rigorous, six‐hour inspections of DC‐1C jetliners, and suggested that the grounded planes could begin flying again this week. There was a big “if,” however. If the Government is still not satisfied, “other inspections, and even design changes, could be required,” Federal officials said. The domestic fleet of 138 DC‐10's has been grounded since June 6, 12 days after one of the planes crashed in Chicago with a loss of 273 lives. As the craft left the ground, the mount from which the left engine was hung beneath the wing broke off, causing the pilot to lose control. F. Langhorne Bond, the F.A.A. Administrator, has said that finding a solution to such a control problem, involving wing slats and hydraulic systems, is one factor that will determine whether the planes will be allowed to fly this week. The eight domestic airlines that rely heavily on DC‐10's for long‐haul flights have lost an estimated $2.5 million a day during the grounding. Foreign airlines returned most of their DC‐10's to service late last month but the aircraft have not been permitted to land in this country, Michael Wright, Daniel Lewis and Caroline Rand Herron George L. Forbes"
A Vote for the Federal President,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/09/archives/a-vote-for-the-federal-president.html,"A strong alliance of reformers is again pushing the idea that we elect our Presidents by direct popular vote, without the filter of an Electoral College. Counting every vote equally sounds so simple and attractive that normally cautious politicians find it difficult to resist. A Constitutional amendment to abolish the College reaches the Senate this week with an outside chance of obtaining the necessary 67 votes. One would think that the reformers’ zeal for “one person, one vote” might as logically lead them to abolish the Senate. If any of our Federal institutions offends arithmetical justice it is the one that grants the same two votes to 22 million Californians and 650,000 Nevadans. For reasons that Senators should value, these United States have found it useful and in no sense undemocratic to retain some imbalance and geographical color in their Federal system. Simplicity is not the synonym of democracy. Voter parity is not the only source of stability. A Presidential election that is federal is not therefore unsound. Every youngster understands our rules for electing a President. The winner of the popular vote in every state receives its total “electoral vote.” Each state's electoral vote equals the size of its delegation in Congress; as in the Senate, this arithmetic favors smaller states. But in a close election, there is compensation for voters in more populous states. As urban minorities have recognized, winning a large state by a slight margin yields a richer prize than winning a small state by a landslide. The unplanned effects of this system have been mostly good. It turns the contest for President into 52 races (including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico). It makes it impossible for candidates to write off the less populous regions or overcrowded city slums; both count for slightly more than their numerical weight. Moreover, the system blunts single‐issue fury. Citizens who oppose gun control or abortion cannot simply unite nationally to elect, or defeat, a President; they must join, state by state, with other voters moved by other passions. This necessity for compromise, in turn, holds most voters inside our two federal parties, and the parties are thus held near the middle of the political road. To elect a President, even arrogant majorities must be so licitous of minorities; even alienated minorities must work with majorities. The system encourages moderation in radical times and protects against parochial passions. It discourages minor parties yet rewards their protest with major‐party attentiveness. It is widely understood and accepted. It is a bond with history, a source of stability. So why abandon it? Because to many a “direct” and “popular” election sounds more democratic. They also want to avoid the largely theoretical risk that electoral votes might elect a candidate who lost the popular vote. That could happen‐ but it hasn't happened since 1888. To guard against that small risk, Senator Birch Bayh and 38 cosponsors of his amendment would abandon all the advantages of federal voting and run dangerous new risks. Knowing that a direct election would encourage third and fourth and fifth parties to run their own candidates, they would let a vote of 40 percent determine the winner. Sensing that minor candidates might skim off enough votes to leave no one with even 40 percent, they would then run a second election between the two top contenders, who had maybe 37 and 32 percent of the original vote. Just imagine their sordid barter for the support of the first‐round losers. The clamor for abolition of the Electoral College was born in the fear of George Wallace in 1968. Some thought the strident Alabaman might parlay a mere 10 percent of the popular vote into enough electoral votes to deny Richard Nixon or Hubert Humphrey a majority. And because electoral votes are cast by real people in the Electoral College, he might have traded their ballots for a heavy price. Mr. Nixon, especially, might have paid well to avert a deadlock that threw the choice to a Democratic House of Representatives. It didn't happen. And the chances are that Mr. Wallace would have won still more votes in the first round of a “direct” election — and thus enormous influence in the runoff. But that is only one of the flaws of the proposed reform. The danger of tawdry trading in the Electoral College is easily averted without any radical change. The desirable amendment would abolish the flesh‐and‐blood electors yet retain the counting of electoral votes. Why change what works?"
High Court Term Report: Advances in Civil Rights,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/09/archives/high-court-term-report-advances-in-civil-rights-successful-year-for.html,"WASHINGTON, July 8 — The Supreme Court term that ended last week will be remembered as the term that upheld both affirmative action to eliminate job discrimination and busing to integrate schools. The decisions gave legal and psychological boosts to the frayed civil rights movement and made clear that the Court would continue to play an active role in integrating the job market and the public school system. But the decisions, coming as they did in dramatic sequence In the final days of the session, also lent an aura of purpose and consistency to a Supreme Court term that, scholars say, was notably lacking in either trait. In areas from criminal law to women's rights and the regulatory powers of the Federal Government, the Court's actions often seemed contradictory and confusing. If there were any coherent themes to emerge from the term, they remain as yet undiscovered by those who scrutinize the Court's activities. ‘Successful Year for Race’ “On the one hand, they're locked up in a fortress, beating back threatening developments that come up from the lower courts,” said Laurence H. Tribe, a constitutional scholar at Harvard Law School. “On the other hand, it was an exceptionally successful year for race.” To assess the term as inconsistent or confusing, scholars say, is neither to condemn the Court nor to read a final judgment, but to look upon the Court as a political institution that reflects an uncertain national mood. “You've got a country at large somewhat confused about its direction,” said Paul Gewirtz; a professor at Yale Law School. “Labels like ‘liberal’ and ‘conservative’ are increasingly absurd. On every issue of public policy, there's a thrust and counterthrust that paralyze action. How can the Court be unaffected by that mood?” In the last few years, Professor Gewirtz said, the Court has been preoccupied with deciding how far to extend firmly established principles In such areas as equal protection or defendants’ rights. ‘Trouble With Margin Questions’ “They're not retreating from the core principles,” he added, “but they're having trouble with the margin questions.” The Court issued 130 full opinions during the term, which began last Oct. and ended July 2. Fifty‐one of the term's 130 cases were decided by unanimous votes, and 13 others brought only one dissent. The Justices split, 5 to 4, in only 21 cases — statistics that hardly support the image of contention sometimes ascribed to the Court. But the statistical harmony can be misleading. The unanimity came in the areas of commercial, labor and administrative law. In the 16 cases involving issues of race or sex discrimination, there were eight 5‐to‐4 splits. The votes that produced the frequently contradictory results were made up of shifting coalitions. As in past years, Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Associate Justices Lewis F. Powell and William H. Rehnquist often voted together, providing a more or less predictable three votes on the right as Associate Justices William J. Brennan Jr. and Thurgood Marshall did on the left. Swing votes were provided by any of the remaining four members of the Court — Associate Justices Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens, Potter Stewart and Byron R. White. The results were sometimes surprising. Justice Stewart is regarded as having providing the crucial fifth vote for the majority in United Steelworkers of America v. Weber, which upheld the legality of voluntary affirmative action in employment. Justice Stewart also wrote the opinion for the five‐member majority in Gannett v. DePasquale on the last day of the term. That opinion, giving judges wide discretion to exclude the public and the press from criminal proceedings, was one of several decisions in which a majority of the Court adopted a restricted view of the First Amendment. Following is a summary of the Court's major actions this year: Racial Discrimination In the Weber case, the Court ruled that private employers can legally give special preferences to black workers to eliminate “manifest racial imbalance” in historically white‐only jobs. Voting 5 to 2, the Justices rejected the argument of Brian F. Weber, a white worker from Louisiana, that the ban on discrimination in employment on the basis of race, contained in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, made such “affirmative action” illegal. The Court strongly reaffirmed its commitment of court‐ordered busing as a means of integrating Northern school districts by affirming Federal busing orders in Dayton and Columbus, Ohio. Women's/Family Rights The Court upheld the constitutionality of veterans’ preference laws, rejecting the lower court's conclusion that because an absolute preference law in Massachusetts had such a “devastating” impact on women's job opportunities, it constituted unconstitutional discrimination on the basis of sex. The Justices held that the women had failed to prove that the lawmakers intentionally discriminated against them. The Court ruled in two abortion cases. In one, it struck down a Pennsylvania law that required a doctor to choose the method of abortion most likely to save the life of the potentially viable fetus. In the other, it declared unconstitutional Massachusetts law that required unmarried minors to get the permission of their parents or a judge to obtain a legal abortion. The Justices upheld state laws that allow parents to commit their minor children to state mental institutions, rejecting two lower court rulings that the child is constitutionally entitled to a formal hearing before commitment. Criminal Law On issues involving probable cause for physical searches and arrests, the Court usually came down on the side of the defendant. In Delaware v. Prouse, it declared unconstitutional the widespread police practice of random stopping of motorists for license and registration checks. In Lo‐Ji Sales v. New York, the Court set aside a conviction based on an open‐ended search warrant, sanctioned by the judge and filled in by the police after they had completed their search. On issues of privacy and prisoners’ rights, the majority generally favored government. In Smith v. Maryland, the Court held that the police do not need a search warrant before installing a pen register, a device that records the numbers dialed from a particular telephone. In Rakas v. Illinois, it limited to those with a “legitimate expectation of privacy” — in that case, a car's owner but not a passenger—the right to raise a constitutional challenge to a search of a particular location: The decision that may have the greatest impact on criminal law may be Bell v. Wolfish, which reversed an appellate court opinion and held that the presumption of innocence accorded to inmates awaiting trial does not give them the constitutional right to, be subjected only to minimal restrictions that could be justified by the “compelling necessities” of jail administration. Government Regulation The Court unanimously upheld the authority of the Food and Drug Administration to ban the interstate distribution of laetrile. Other Federal regulatory agencies did not do so well. In a defeat for the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Court ruled that a worker's interest in his pension is not a security and allegations of fraud by pension plans are not within the S.E.C.'s jurisdiction. The Justices also ruled that Congress had not authorized the Federal Communications Commission to require operators of cable television systems to provide free community access to their facilities. Rejecting an interpretation by the Department of Health, Education and’ Welfare, the Justices ruled that the Rehabilitation Act does not require a college to accept a student whose handicap prevents him from meeting the requirements of a particular program. The case involved the effort of a deaf woman to enter a college nursing program. Access to Courts This was one area in which an identifiable trend did seem to emerge. A hallmark of the Court in the last decade has been a series of decisions limiting the circumstances under which individuals can take their complaints to Federal court. In this term, several decisions went the other way. In Jackson v. Virginia, the Court overruled a 19‐year‐old precedent and directed that Federal courts, in ruling on petitions for habeas corpus from state prisoners, set aside convictions if the evidence does not show guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Under the previous standard. Federal judges denied habeas corpus if any evidence supported the conviction. The Court ruled that the law known as Title IX, which bans sex discrimination in education, permits individuals as well as the Federal Government to sue schools and colleges for violations. On the other hand, in Baker v. McCollan, the Court threw out a damage suit against a sheriff for false imprisonment, holding that the mistake had not deprived the victim of any constitutional rights. Antitrust The Court ruled that consumers, as well as commercial enterprises, can sue antitrust violators for triple damages under the Clayton Act. It also ruled that Blue Shield plans have no automatic exemption from the antitrust laws when they contract to reimburse doctors or druggists at fixed rates. In the decision with the broadest implications for antitrust doctrine, the Court held that the system under which television networks are charged a blanket fee for a license to broadcast copyrighted music ‘does not constitute illegal price‐fixing. The decision, Broadcast Music Inc. v. CBS, was a strong indication of the Justices’ growing dislike for automatic applications of the antitrust laws without detailed inquiries into whether the challenged applications might be increasing economic efficiency and helping consumers. Press/Public Access In affirming a New York court ruling that made it easier to close pretrial hearings to the public, the Justices went Considerably further and gave judges almost unlimited discretion to close not only hearings, but also criminal trials when the defense and prosecution agree to the closing. Lawyers representing the press generally regarded the decision against the Gannett Company Inc., the Rochester‐based newspaper chain that brought the case challenging judicial secrecy, as the most unfavorable in years. They were scarcely enthusiastic about other rulings in the First Amendment area. In Herbert v. Lando, the Court ruled that the First Amendment does not shield reporters and editors from having to answer questions about their “state of mind” if they choose to defend against libel suits. In two other libel cases, Hutchinson v. Proxmire and Wolston v. Reader's Digest, the Court all but eliminated from the category of “public figures” — those plaintiffs who must prove “actual malice” — anyone who had not voluntarily become embroiled in a public controversy. The decisions will make it easier for persons accused or convicted of crimes, as well as for low‐level government officials, to bring successful libel suits. In one favorable press decision, Smith v. Daily Mail, the Court held that a state may not punish a newspaper for publishing the name of a juvenile accused of a crime."
Science Watch,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/10/archives/science-watch-alaska-quake-predicted.html,"Using the so‐called gap method of earthquake prediction, a team of specialists has concluded that a major quake is due near Cape Yakataga on the coast of Alaska midway between Anchorage and Juneau. Consequently, Dr. H. William Menard has alerted state and Federal officials. No specific time was predicted, but the group said that “the earthquake could occur .anytime and is likely within the next two to four decades.” The gap method assumes that the northwest drift of the vast plate forming much of the Pacific Ocean, floor develops strain around its rim, and that periodic earthquakes are necessary to relieve the pressure. Where earthquake records indicate a gap in such activity, it is assumed that a quake is overdue. In recent months, this method has been used successfully to predict quakes in Mexico and Alaska. The newly identified gap lies between zones affected by two major earthquakes of the recent past. To the west, toward Valdez and An chorage, is the region affected by the great earthquake of 1979. To the east is a coastal zone shaken by a major quake in 1958 and the area to the north was badly shaken last Feb. 28. The prediction was made by scientists from the Lamont‐Doherty Geological Observatory of Columbia University and the United States Geological Survey. Hazardous Herbal Remedy An herbal “remedy” that is toxic to the liver and has already caused at least one death is being sold in health food stores and used by women to induce abortions. As little as a quarterounce of the substance, called pennyroyal, can cause dizziness and intoxication. The woman who died, an 18‐yearold in Colorado, had consumed two half‐ounce bottles of it. Two other Colorado women who survived their abortion attempts were hospitalized. According to Dr. Barry H. Rumack, director of the Rocky Mountain Poison Center in Denver, as little as a teaspoon of pennyroyal can cause seizures. Other symptoms of pennyroyal poisoning include nausea and kidney and liver failure. Plan for Space Station The feasibility of a space station orbiting the earth at an altitude of about 29,000 miles — a tenth of the way to the moon — will be studied under a contract awarded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to General Dynamics in San Diego. It would serve as a platform for a variety of “plug‐in” payloads. At that altitude, an orbiting station would keep pace with the earth's spin, seeming to remain stationary over one region. The station would be assembled in space and would be able to carry payloads for communications, studying weather and earth resources and various other scientific roles. Saliva and Wound Healing The tendency of animals to lick their wounds has been so familiar for so long that it has become an accepted figure of speech. It is logical to think simple cleansing of the wound is part of its value. But scientists at Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne, Australia, have discovered another benefit. Although their discovery was made in experiments with rats, the research workers think it may prove valuable to surgeons and their human patients. The discovery, described in a recent issue of Nature, the British science journal, is that some substance or substances in rat saliva accelerates the contraction of tissues that is an early part of the process of wound healing. “This may be of practical significance in human surgery, as wound contraction is believed to be similar in all mammals,” said the report."
Books of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/11/archives/books-of-the-times-the-evil-is-banal.html,"I'VE been thinking about suspense novels rnd wondering why so many of them are poorly written. An experienced author like Desmond Bagley will learn all about vintage airplanes and about the customs and topography of the Algerian desert FLYAWAY. By Desmond Bagley. 300 pages. Doubleday. $9.95. KIKI. By John Gill. 217 pages. Little,Brown. $8.95. in order to write “Flyaway,” but he won't take the trouble to learn the most elementary things about writing fiction, or about creating characters. The people in “Flyaway” snap and snarl their lines instead of saying them, and they snap and snarl acidly, caustically, suspiciously, carefully, gently, grimly. Even worse than this, which is a relatively small affair, they snag and snarl the most improbable things. Stafford, a former colonel in the British Army and the head of a private security organization, says “I suspect jiggery‐pokery at high levels.” Faced with a difficult search in the desert, he says: “Talk about needles in haystacks. And there's that proverb about leaving no bloody stone unturned.” Lash, a hired killer, says “I'm not going to stand here and fry my brains out.” When he believes he has finished his job and earned his fee, Kissack, another hired killer, jumps up and down shouting “5,000 quid! Five grand!” The Evil Is Banal Perhaps I'm romantic, but it seems to me that a hired killer would not jump up and down with joy, would not say “I wish I could believe you,” as Lash does. If only for sentimental reasons, I insist on thinking that the diction of hired killers is just a little different from other ,peoples'. There must be some consistency in the world. Evil can't be all that banal. Could such inept writing be deliberate? Is it possible that,, just as their characters break the laws of society, so the authors of some crime novels break the laws of fiction? The notion is no more far‐fetched than to suppose that, after several successful books, they still don't know how to write at all. Crime novels are admittedly an escape from ordinary life. Could their readers be escaping from the ordinary rules of fiction too, commiting crimes against the form, enjoying the brutality of the technique? Could this be an unconscious collusion between author and reader? If you can ignore the style, which I could not, “Flyaway” has some readable moments in the middle, where Mr. Bagley's research pays off. The beginning is slow and stiff, however, and the conclusion is mostlyjiggery‐pokery. “Kiki,” by John Gill, is a much smoother affair, a reasonably original psychological thriller with two or three well‐realized characters. Sarge, the protagonist, is a divorced 4merican doctor in a hospital in southern France. He leads a life of careful, limited happiness with his 17‐year‐old daughter Marion, until she dies of an illegal abortion. After reading his daughter's diary, Sarge kidnaps a young doctor, Kemp, whom he accuses of being his daughter's lover and murderer. Locking Kemp in the specially prepared cellar of his house, Sarge says, “You've destroyed the meaning of my life and I intend to destroy the meaning of yours.” Kemp is a womanizer, and in order to humiliate him, Sarge presents him with a life‐size rubber doll, especially designed for pornographicurposes. The scene in which Sarge buys the doll in a sex shop — with “accessories,” she costs almost $1,000 — is interesting, and even stranger is the section In which Sarge gives the doll, which is named Kiki, a thorough medical examination. A Perfect Character Peyruse, the detective investigating Marion's death and Kemp's disappearance, is just about perfect. He marshals his evidence as a first‐rate novel‐, ist might. He says to Sarge, “You have helped to flavor my mind.” Alicia, Kemp's former wife, is one of those attractive women whose humanity is almost wholly tensed in a kind of sexual voracity. When Sarge tries to go to bed with her, he suffers a spontaneous nose‐bleed. Peyruse says of Alicia, “She is a woman in need of consolation.” Then adds to Sarge, in a sentence that exploits the tonal irony of the French language, “One hopes you were able to console her.” In his confinement, Kemp makes a remarkable adjustment, asking.Sarge to buy Kiki a dress, so she won't have to sit around naked all day. He requests flowers for her, and a spool of lavender thread, so that he can take up the hem of her dress, which is a trifle too long. While “Kiki” is a closet drama, with none of the panoramic sweep of “Flyaway,” Mr. Gill works with the precision of a miniature painter. He reminds us that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in our philosophy. And he writes so well that even Kiki is more real than any of Mr. Bagley's flesh-and-blood characters."
NEW EDUCATION UNIT APPROVED BY HOUSE Bill to Create Cabinet Department Is Sent to Conference Panel.,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/12/archives/new-education-unit-approved-by-house-bill-to-create-cabinet.html,"WASHINGTON, July 11— The Carter Administration won a narrow victory today as the House voted, 210 to 206, to create a Cabinet‐level department of education. The Senate passed similar legislation last April, 72 to 21, but there could be rough times ahead as Senate and House conferees seek to reconcile broad differences between the two bills. The Senate bill was essentially what President Carter had requested, simply the creation of a 13th Cabinet department embracing some, but not all, of the scattered Federal education programs. Senate Opposition Expected The bill that emerged from the House was amended to permit laws encouraging prayers in public schools, to ban the busing of students to achieve racial desegregation, to prohibit racial or sexual quotas for admission to colleges and to bar abortions in the proposed new department's medical facilities for employees. The Senate, as well as the Carter Administration, is certain to oppose inclusion of such controversial amendments. But most of the amendments were adopted by the House by margins of at least 2 to 1, making it difficult for House conferees to bow. to Senate demands for dropping them. One of the principal opponents of the bill, Representative John M. Ashbrook, Republican of Ohio, said today those against the bill were attempting to bring about “a permanent impasse in conference” in offering such amendments. However, the Senate floor manager for the bill, Abraham Ribicoff, Democrat of Connecticut, said, “I'm sure all differences between the House and Senate will be ironed out in conference.” Administration spokesmen hailed the House vote on what they called “historic’ legislation.” $14 Billion Budget As President Carter's principal Government reorganization effort of the year, the bill would create a new department with an initial budget of about $14.1 billion and about 17,400 employees. The major component of the new department would be the present Office of Education, now housed in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Thus, H.E.W. would be stripped of its “E.” Also shifted to the new department would be the Defense Department's schools for overseas dependents, the Agriculture Department's graduate school, the Labor Department's migrant education program, certain science education programs now run by the National Science Foundation, and college housing loans administered by tie Department of Housing and Urban Development. Indian Schools Among Exemptions Among Federal education programs that would not be transferred to the new department are the Indian schools run by the Department of Interior and the preschool Headstart program, which would remain in what is now the Health, Education and Welfare Department. The long and often bitter floor fights leading up to today's House passage of the bill stretched over more than month, with House Democratic leaders putting the measure aside from time to time to consider pressing legislation. Support for the bill seemed, for the most part, unenthusiastic. And with the addition of the amendments to curb busing and racial quotas and encourage school prayer, support melted even further. Creation of the department was opposed by a coalition that had seldom joined forces. It included a majority of House Republicans, who feared the bill would lead to Federal control of local education, as well as to creation of another giant bureaucracy, and a large number of liberal Democrats who feared that creating the department would crumble the education‐labor‐health‐civil rights bloc that has wielded power over social legislation. Strong backing came from the National Education Association, with its 1.8 million membership of teachers and educators. Opposing the new department were the American Federation of Teachers and a number of other education groups. Today, during the tense 15‐minute vote, House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. and his Democratic lieutenants pleaded privately with wavering members as the electronic vote tally seesawed back and forth, with first one side forging ahead, then the other. Supporters cheered loudly as the final tally was announced. Voting for the bill were 175 Democrats and 35 Republicans; voting against, 89 Democrats and 117 Republicans. The relatively few Republicans supporting the bill were led by Representative Frank Horton of upstate New York. Democratic floor leader for the measure was Representative Jack Brooks of Texas."
Women's Caucus Drafts Strategy for 1980 Election,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/15/archives/womens-caucus-drafts-strategy-for-1980-election-emissaries-from.html,"CINCINNATI, July 14 — The political activists pulled their chairs into a circle and took up the topic of the evening how to become delegates to the Presidential nominating conventions next year. One speaker warned that aspiring delegates had to start early because the maneuvering begins “long before the precinct meetings are held.” A precinct captain from Colorado urged the audience to volunteer for party work on Election Day because “that's where the power is, in the election judges.” Here at the biannual convention of the National Women's Political Caucus, an organization with 40,000 members nalon wide, Presidential politics is in the air, and with good reason. The Democrats have agreed that 50 percent of the delegates next year will be women, and the Republicans have promised to try to reach that goal. Accordingly, women have greater opportunity to influence the selection of Presidential nominees than ever before.  “It's hap pened late, reluctantly and slowly,” id Mildred Jeffrey, the chairman of he caucus. All Presidential candidates, she said, must “deal positively with women and women's issues.” Emissaries From Candidates The rising political power of women was demonstrated this weekend when most of the major'Republican candidates sent representatives here to answer questions and seek support. The Administration was represented by half a dozen officials, including Sarah Weddington, President Carter's chief adviser on women's issues and a founding member of the caucus. “They're hard workers and they know what they're doing,” said William C. Chafey, an aide to John B. Connally, the former Governor of Texas. Dorann Gunderson, a political coordinator for the George Bush campaign, added: “The women's movement has a growing influence in politics. They're not on the fringes anymore.” In a series of workshops and strategy sessions, the women here indicated that they were more concerned these days with precinct lists than with protest marches. Cleta Deatherage, a State Representative from Oklahoma, warned one audience that.party leaders would probably try to fill the female quota with their wives and friends. Representative Barbara Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, urged Democratic women not to lose in‘terest in the election because Mr. Carter appeared likely to win renomination. “Funny things,” she said, “might happen on the way to the White House.” Women accounted for only one‐third of the delegates to the two conventions in 1976. The change next year could have several important implications, and already Republican women have forced their party to hqld its convention in Michigan, a state that has ratified the proposed equal rights amendment. Republicans within the National Women's Political Caucus have also drafted a long questionnaire for Presidential aspirants, asking them for their positions on such issues as abortion and the selection of a female running mate. “We have to keep the candidates’ feet to the fire,” said Patricia Goldman, a Republican activist who is a member of the Natonal Transportation Safety Board. Most caucus members said they continued to care deeply about such traditional women's issues as child care and the proposed equal rights amendment, if only because they believed that men did not care enough about them. But it was also clear this weekend that the members were increasingly concerned with broader national issues, from energy to economics. One reason is that many women are making the connection between their traditional experienes and questions of Government policy. “ Lhook at taxes, inflation, energy, health — these are all really women's issues,” said Susan McLane, state legislator from New Hampshire. “We're the ones who turn on the oveqs, or take care of the sick and elderly.” Lack of Eneigy Has Impact The vast influx of women into the work force has accentuated these concerns. “When women are commuting to work, the lack of energy has a real impact on them,” noted Joanne Howes, leader of the caucus's Democratic wing. Miss Gunderson, the aide to Mr. Bush, added: “As my salary gets higher, I focus more on taxes, on how much interest rates are going up, on what it costs to send kids to college. These issues are no different than for men.” This weekend many women conceded that gaining more political influence, particularly over issues not traditionally associated with women, was not an easy task. Several speakers asserted that Bella S. Abzug, the former Congresswoman from New York, was dismissed from her job with the Carter Administration, at least partly because she criticized the President's economic policies. At several meetings, women voiced the problem of balancing their feminist feelings against political reality, and the need to appeal to a broad spectrum of voters. In a speech yesterday, Betsey Wright, political action director of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, told the convention delegates that women were still “too modest” about themselves and their abilities. But there were definite signs at this convention that women were shedding that cautiousness. “Power is a good word,” asserted Miss Jeffrey, the caucus leader. “Sometimes we back away from it.” “Women are taking themselves more seriously,” Miss Gunderson added. United Press International Mildred Jeffrey, caucus chairman, asserted that Presidential candidates must now address themselves to women's issues.

From Minister To Midwife,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/15/archives/connecticut-weekly-from-minister-to-midwife.html,"NEW HAVEN WHEN Gail Carlo of West Haven gave birth to her first son, Brian, recently at Yale‐New Haven Hospital, she was attended by a nurse‐midwife who is a former football player and an ordained minister. Ronald L. Krauss, 34, gave up the ministry to become a certified nursemidwife, an occupation almost overwhelmingly populated by women. Of the nearly 900 nurse‐midwives certified by the American College of Nurse‐Midwives, only six are men. The role of nurse‐midwives covers a wide range of services, but is designed .primarily to manage pregnancies, labor and deliveries that are “normal,” Mr. Krauss said. The birth of an infant is one of life's greatest celebrations’ In addition, they offer advice on prenatal care, management of the postpartum period, family planning, nutritional counseling and childbirth education. Still athletic in appearance, the 6‐foot 4‐inch, 210‐pound Mr. Krauss conceded that he had qualms about entering his new occupation. “However, what these nurse‐midwives were doing,” he said in an interview, “was more important to me than the fact that midwifery is an occupation made up mostly of women.” The father of two children, both of whom were delivered by nurse‐midwives, Mr. Krauss is employed as a nurse‐midwife at the Community Health Care Center Plan, a comprehensive, prepaid medical and hospital health maintenance organization, on New Haven's waterfront. Before deciding to become a nursemidwife, he served in the ministry for five years, two at the First Congregational Church in Stamford, and then at the Congregational Church in Killingworth. Mrs. Carlo said she was pleased with Mr. Krauss's skill and consideration. “I was really impressed with the fact that he stayed with me all night at the hospital until the baby was born,” she said. Not only did he take a lot of time to answer all of her questions, she said, but “he called me every couple of days before the baby was born to learn how I was doing.” She added that she was very satisfied with Mr. Krauss as a nurse‐midwife because he “has a very good understanding of what a pregnant woman is going through.” Mr. Krauss is a graduate of Lycoming College in Williamsport, Pa., where he was on the football, basketball and track teams, and of the Yale Divinity School. To become a nurse‐midwife, Mr. Krauss spent three years at the Yale School of Nursing, completing the course in May of this year. When he realized that the ministry no longer satisfied some of his innermost needs, he said, he discussed the problem with his wife, Judith, an associate dean of the Yale School of Nursing. Together they decided that he should become a nurse, believing that this would enable them to do “more collaborative work.” In the process of becoming a nurse, he was attracted to nurse‐midwifery. “This profession,” he said, “allows one to develop a very close and intense relationship with people in a deeply personal and joyful experience.” He was not a complete novice in the field. Recalling his years on a farm near Lansdale, Pa., Mr. Krauss noted that by age 12, “I was already assisting in the birth of farm animals. We had a large dairy herd and sometimes a cow would have difficulty delivering a calf, especially when there was a breech birth in which the calf's feet came out first.” In this type of birth, he explained, the cow needed assistance if it and the calf were to survive. He learned that he could assist the cow by pulling on the calf's exposed legs and hindquarters. “Those experiences,” he added, “were ones of amazement and wonder to me. The miracle of birth has never ceased to fascinate me. It gave me a feeling of being close to nature.” He added that nurse‐midwifery combined for him the best in both nursing and the ministry, noting: “The birth of an infant is one of life's greatest celebrations, which is also one of the major themes of the ministry.” Nurse‐midwives manage the normal pregnancy in consultation with an obstetrician‐gynecologist, and provide physical and emotional support to the mother and her family throughout the association. Beyond that, nurse‐midwives are trained to cope with certain obstetrical emergencies, such as postpartum hemorrhages, spontaneous abortion, prevention of strangulation of the fetus, and how to deal with a slow or rapidly decreasing heart rate in the fetus.They also are trained to identify high‐risk factors in prospective mothers. When any of these are discovered, consultation with the physician is necessary. Most nurse‐midwives deliver infants in a hospital, with a physician in attendance, to offer maximum protection for mother and child. Asked how women respond to him as a male midwife, Mr. Krauss replied, “Most women are willing to accept a male in the nurse‐midwife role, just as women have accepted male obstetricians and male gynecologists.” Only one woman in his experience voiced an objection to having a male nurse‐midwife. She was given the option of requesting a female nurse‐midwife, but she finally decided to accept Mr. Krauss's services when his supervisor assured the woman of his competence and extreme gentleness. The woman's pregnancy, labor and delivery went smoothly, and from then on she became one of Mr. Krauss's advocates. Mr.Krauss said the trend in the use of nurse‐midwives was growing. A halfcentury ago, there were many selftaught women working as midwives in the United States, to be sure, but none of them prior to that time had had hospital or university training. Today, however, there are 863 certified nurse‐midwives in the nation, licensed to practice midwifery in 49 of the 50 states. The lone exception is Kansas, which does not allow nurse‐midwives to practice. In all, there are 23 nurse‐midwifery schools in the nation; the only one in Connecticut is at Yale. Following one of the more than 50 deliveries he has made to date, Mr. Krauss was asked by the parents of one of the infants to baptize their child. He was happy to oblige.

Letter,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/17/archives/letters-mankind-may-be-better-off-without-salt-ii.html,"Mankind May Be Better. Off Without SALT II To the Editor: The:abundant discussion concerning SALT’ II ratification has consistently overlooked the possibility that, at this stage of the game, it may be better for mankind if both sides shun a treaty limiting nuclear weapons. SALT I sparked an exhaustive re‐, view by the U. S. and the Soviets of their respective strategic weaknesses and, in preparation for the renewal of the treaty, intensive‐ efforts were made to remedy those weak4eises to amplify bargaining positions. Witness the mind‐boggling MX concept. Moreover, weapons research and develop ment in areas excluded from. SALT I coverage received exceptional attention and dollars to rapidly step up evolution of those Systems. Witness the recent accomplishments in laser weaponry and MI RV capability. This startling “progress” in sophisticated weaponry began when the idea of a treaty was first proposed and has intensified ever since. Development has far exceeded the gradual, incremental improvement in systems that is Produced by a defense bureaucracy inching through other myriad administrative issues when no such overriding’ priorities are imposed. Moreover, any believer in the lessons of history must note that startling historical precedent exists.. Growing attention has been given recently to the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, the first major arms limitation agreement. Signed by England, Japan and the the treaty froze‐ battleship development and provided for scrapping a considerable portion of existing battleship tonnage to achieve certain ratios. The treaty saved the signatories a vast amount of money and froze battleship size for many years. However, intensive attention was then given‐to development of aircraft carriers and cruisers, which were excluded categories. In addition, Japan, quite understandably, read the treaty to the letter and developed other craft such as submarine tenders whose hulls could quickly, be adapted to battleship specifications. England and the U.S., following the spirit of the treaty, let other forms of military shipbuilding lag for over a decade. By the late 1930's Japan was far andad by virtue of the agreements and abrogated tile treaty in 1936. It was the relatively vulnerable aircraft carrier that led to the decision to launch a pre‐emptive strike. on Dec. 7, 1941. The parallels with the present situation are disturbing. Today, much attention is being given to our capability to detect Soviet cheating. It is conceivable that Should we uncover such cheating and call the Soviets to account before the world, the resulting deterioration in relations could be extremely dangerous and might trigger an armed conflict. Without a treaty, there can be no cheating. What will happen’ without a treaty? Intelligence gathering will go on as it always has, and weapons development will of course occur, but the abnormally intensive attention and priorities spawned by treaty reviews and preparations will be gone. Changes will occur’ as the intelligence process rumbles along and feeds our planners with the normal pace of data, unaffected by artifical deadlines and pressures from poll‐conscious politicans whose personal careers the treaties place on the line. In this case; their personal careers are entwined with our lives; and I'd prefer that they didn't fan the flames that are already too high. To the Editor: Last year,. street vendors in midtown sold a small cup of freshly squeezed orange juice for 50 cents. This year they squeeze the juice ahead of time, let it stand in pitchers with lots of ice cubes, and sell a small cup for 75 cents. That's a 50 percent price increase, plus about 15 percent melted‐ice dilution, and works out to an effective 75 percent increase for the actual juice content. Guidelines, anyTci the Editor; A recent news article in The Times ('Increase of Carbon Dioxide in Air Alarms Scientists') discussed the possible consequences of adding the massive amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the earth's atmosphere that result from the combustion of oil, coal and natural gas. It was pointed out that a continuation or acceleration of the worldwide usage of fuels could result in some climatic changes, and would tend to increase average tempera, tureS. It should be said, however, that the different fuels are not alike for making this unwanted CO2 contribution. For the same amount of energy produced — in the combustion, coal would produce about twice as much carbon dioxide as natural gas, with heating oils and gasoline somewhere in between. There is a clear case for trying to accelerate the discovery and usage of natural gas as much as possible, to replace other fuels and minimize the problem. If natural gas proved to be much more abundant than thought heretofore — and there are strong indications that this may be the case — then we may one day be willing to make a fuel that avoids all contamination problems completely. Methane, the chief component of natural gas, can be dissociated to carbon and hydrogen; the carbon can be left to accumulate as carbon black, and just the hydrogen be burned. In this process just half the energy of the gas is utilized, but only water is generated in the combustion. The carton black so accumulated has industrial uses, perhaps even one day as a major structural material, if carbon fiber technology is advanced; or it may be merely left in reserve as a fuel to be used in an emergency or at a time when the natural mopping up mechanisms of atmospheric CO2 have caught up and can cope with a further load. Thus, the global CO2 problem should not be seen as a reason for curbing the search for fuels, but rather as one for accelerating specifically the search for natural gas, so as firstly to minimize that problem and secondly to avoid it altogether if we can afford to utilize only half the available energy Another aspect of the problem that must be mentioned is our ignorance of the natural processes that add CO2 to the atmosphere. The deep earth seems to be puffing out this gas, or other gases that get converted into carbon dioxide, and it may well be doing this in a very unsteady fashion. Even though the man‐made CO2 addition occurs at a higher rate than the longterm average of the natural processes, large fluctuations in the latter can be expected and must then be taken into account. Clearly a global survey, and monitoring of natural and man‐made atmospheric carbon dioxide additions must become a major item for the management of the terrestrial atmosTo the Editor: Professor Eugene V. Rostow's authoritative and scholarly July 3 letter should once and for all make it clear to everyone that the State Department rand the Administration are on very slippery ground when they call Israel's settlements on the so‐called West Bank “Illegal.” One may rightfully be of very different opinion about those settlements. But to call them “illegal” is unwarranted. Professor William V. O'Brien of Georgetown University, in an article in the Washington Star, Nov. 26, 1978, summarizes a balanced opinion about this question this way: “... the prudential judgments relating to the maintenance, expansion or termination of Jewish West Bank settlethents involve issues over which reasonable persons can differ. But these debates ‐are only obscured by unfounded claims that Israel's West Bank policies are contrary to international law. The fact is that … Israel has maintained an occupation on the West Bank that is fully consonant wish the principles of international law and natural justice. The settlements on the West Bank are not ‘illegal’.” There exist widespread confusions about the whole situation. For example, to call the old city of Jerusalem “Arab Jerusalem” is a misnomer. What about the Greek quarter, the Armenian quarter, the large Jewish quarter of the old city? The old city was made Judenrein through expulsion, destruction of synagogues, and desecration of the Jewish cemetery. Since 1844 Jews have been the largest single group of inhabitants of Jerusalem. There have always been ‘Jewish settlements on the West Bank. Hebron, a city with many ancient historical ties with Israel, had a prospering Jewish community until most of them were slaughtered during the Arab riots of 1929‐1936; the rest fled. Another settlement of special interest to me personally is the monastery on Mount Zion of which I had been in charge for 20 years, from 1949 to 1969. The monastery owned, and still owns, land on the West Bank. One of these was, before my time, sold to Jewish pioneers. One of my confreres told me that he saw a photo of the stripped and partly mutilated bodies of the young settlers after an attack by Arabs. Now the Jews have resettled Hebron, and the above mentioned piece of land became the nucleus of what is now the Gush Etzion. Are those re‐settlements “illegal'? To repeat, one can be of different opinion about the prudence of some settlements, expecially that of Elon Moreh. But a simplistic condemnation of all of them is certainly contrary to justice and common sense. (Abbot) LEO A. RUDLOFF Benedictine Monks, Weston Priory Weston, Vt., July 6, 1979 Abortion Issue To the Editor: Joseph Deuel Sullivan's minimizing of the abortion issue in his advocacy (letter July 2) of Catholic archdiocesan control of the financially‐troubled New York Medical College alarms me. His assertion that the archdiocese can reach an “accommodation” on abortion must be incorrect. If medical students are ethically trained to observe the law under archdiocesan auspices, its stand against abortion on demand is betrayed. If the archdiocese trains medical students guided by its own precepts, the state, which charters and will probably help the medical college, is compromised by subsidizing religious instruction to ignore the law with public funds. Dr. Sullivan, himself a Catholic, is a staff and consulting psychiatrist at various private Catholic health facilities in our city. If he were to teach at New York Medical College, could he “accommodate” his own teaching to present law wjthout betraying his religious beliefs? Would he or the archdiocese really be able to resist the temptation to render Caesars unto the Lord? The archdiocese should abandon its plan to control the New York Medical College. If it will not, the state should prevent the realization of such a elan. THOMAS C. MURPHY New York, July 4; 1979 Mankind Without God To the Editor: Contrary to Arthur H. Jones's letterof July 7, the new silver dollar does not in any way imply that Susan B. Anthony trusted in God. Mr. Jones creates an issue by taking the coin's inscription out of context, and then uses this issue to convey his own humanist philosophy. His letter advances the century‐old egotistical claim — “that society can and must create its own noble destiny and fulfillment, with man and woman, equal, together, the sole source of strength, progress, and ideals for its well‐being and happiness.” Unfortunately, in the course of its existence on This planet, mankind has never once succeeded in agreeing on anything. In fact, it seems that a mankind without a God is less than capable of accomplishing anything of lasting value. Historically, the very moral and ethical codes and standards these humanists espouse as the ideal, either claim divine inspiration or credit some higher consciousness with their Source GERALD J. GENTILE Long Beach, N.Y., July 8, 1979 Electoral Votes To the Ediior: The July 9 editorial “A Vote for the Federal President” states that the Electoral College “turns the contest for President into 52 races (including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico).” This is incorrect. Although the District of Columbia selects,, three members of the Electoral College by virtue of the 23d Amendment to the Constitution, Puerto Rico is unrepresented in the Electoral College.

"Cardinal McIntyre of Los Angeles, Retired Archbishop, Is Dead at 93",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/17/archives/cardinal-mcintyre-of-los-angeles-retired-archbishop-is-dead-at-93.html,"LOS ANGELES, July 16 — James Francis Cardinal McIntyre; the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Los Angeles from 1948 to 1970, died early today at St. Vincent's Hospital, where he had been confined for the last severilyetirs. He Was was years old. Special to New York Time Cardinal McIntyre was,one of the Most prominent, dynamic and controversial of the Roman Catholic Church's prelates in the United States. He was known as a leading conservative in what some Catholic analysts called the church's internal “cold war” Over modernization of secular policies and practices. This role capped a remarkabla career that had four distinct phases In the first phase before he entered training fonthe priaSthood at the, age of 29 he as a promising figure in the Wall Street seCurities business. Adminiseratot 25 Years Then came 25 years as an important cleric‐administrator of the Archdiocese of New York As ChanCellor, he Managed many millions of dollars in money and real property for the church. The third phase came in 1948, when he was made Archbishop of Los Angeles and led the expansion of the church—its parishes, schools and hospitals — as Los Angeles underwent the greatest expansion of population of any city in the nation. It was s when this work reached the stage of consolidation and the Cardinal turned more to enunciation of church doctrine and policy that he became a controversial figure. In 1964 John Cogley, then religion editor of The New York Times, wrote of Cardinal McIntyre: “He has been described by more than one Vatican observer as the most reactionary prelate in the church, bar none not even those of the Curia ” Criticized on Civil Rights Cardinal McIntyre drew criticism from both clerical and lay quarters across the nation for. his refusal to speak and act mere forcefully on civil rights and for his sanctions against priests who did. He was also criticized for frictions between hit chancery and several quasi‐autonomous Catholic orders, such as the Jesuits, who operated facilities in his archdiocese. Cardinal McIntyre was one of the most outspoken of the nation's disapproving clerics wheri the United States Supreme Court in 1963 declared unconstitutional devotional Bible reading and prayers in public schools. He said at the time: “It can only mean that an American heritage of philosophy of religion and freedom Ore being abandoned in imitation of Soviet philosophy, Soviet materialism and of Soviet‐regimented liberty.” Messenger at $3 a Week James Francis Aloysius McIntyre was born on June 25, 1886, in New York, on East 28th Street near Third Avenue. His family was of very modest means. His father, James Francis McIntyre, a native of New York, worked in the construction industry. His mother was Mary Pelly McIntyre, who was born in Kiltorma, County Galway, Ireland. He became a messenger at $3 a week for theVall Street concern of H.L. Horton & Company. An executive said of him, “I've never encountered a quicker mind than Frank's.” The youth rose quickly through the ranks to become office manager. But when his father died, he left business to attend Cathedral College and then St. Joseph's Seminary, at Dunwoodie, N.Y. He was ordained in 1921 at St. patrick's Cathedral by Patrick Cardinal Hayes and served for two years at St. Gabriel's Church on East 37th Street. Then he became Chancellor of‐the New YorkArChdiocese. His knowledge of finance proved especially valuable in the Depression. By refinancing the church's debts to low‐interest loans, he bolstered arcndiocesari financeS so no parish defaulted On its obligations. Even the shorthand he had learned in business was put to use to speed his activities. Francis Cardinal Spellman called him “a human idealist and a divine realist” Courtly and soft‐spoken, Chancellor McIntyre was nonethless knwn as a rigorous overseer of the 2,000 prlests in the archdiocese. In 1940, Pope Pipe XII named him Titular Bishop of Cyrene and Auxiliary Bishop of New York. On Feb 7, 1948, Pope Pius XII appointed him head. of the Los Angeles See. In two decades, Archibishop McIntyre's congregation in Los Angeles grew from 625,000 parishioners to more than 1.6 million. Catholic schools increased from 159 to 366 and parishes from 211 to 313. The Archbishop maintained such close supervision of this development that he was sometimes called “the brick‐and‐MOrtar Driest.” Became Cardinal In 1953 In recognition of his work, Pope Pius XII elevated, him to Cardinal on Jan. 12 1953. He was the 12th American to be come a cardinal and the first from see west of St. Louis. When he was elevated, he said, with typical modesty, “The Holy Father is not honoring me — he is honor. Ing the City of theAngels.” In the 1950's, exemption of nonprofit, church‐sponsored schools from property taxes became a burning issue in. California. Cardinal McIntyre played, aleading part in the successful opposition to a 1952 ballot measure to nullify 1951 exemption law. The battle was repeated, with the same result, in 1958. When the question of Federal aid to education arose in 1960, the Cardinal's voice sounded often in support of the view that. any such aid should be accorded to public and church schools alike. Expressed Views Bluntly He was always blunt in expressing his views, even though his words were spoken softly. For example, at a chancery news conference in 1963 he said: “There is no such thing as separation of church and state to any man who believes in God. It's a shibboleth. It's always been a shibboleth. There can't be any separation of church and state unless you want to be a Communist or a materialist ‐and if you waht to, that's your privilege.” Attitudes toward the Cardinal shifted with time. Until mid‐1964, he was esteemed by clergy and laity alike. But then he was assailed bitterly — even by some segments of the Catholic press for his long silence on the racial question. The issue came to a head in the great California debate over a proposed constitutional amendment to nullify the state's open‐housing laws. The Cardinal was urged by many Catholics to join other California prelates in defending the law. He demurred on the ground that this would in(rolve the church in “politics.” Critics charged that this was an evasion, recalling that the Cardinal had not hesitated to involve his persongirl his office in controversial legislation for church tax exemptions and. Government aid to church schools: In rebutting the eriticism of his position on racial, problems supporters of the Cardinal said that the archdiocese had collaborated actively in many phases of the Federal antipoverty program affecting black areas, that it had provided emergency relief in Watts after the August 1965 riot and that it had established a job placement bureau in cooperation with the National Urban League. Another issue on which the Cardinal's position became controversial was abortion. He opposed as “legalized murder” measure that the California State Legislature passed to liberalize abortion. A Different Attitude Not long before the. Cardinal retired in 1970, a Catholic writer summed up his era in Los Angeles in these words: “In the new. image of the Catholic Church as, propagated by Pope John and continued by Pope Paul, Cardinal McIntyre represented a different church: atti, tude. The Cardinal wasin the tradition of the old Irish. Catholic priest — stubborn, paternalistic, authoritative, frugal and puritanical on moral behavior But he left monuments in his archdiacete in brick and mortar, solidly financed.” Cardinal Timothy Manning said that a funeral mass was schichiled for Saturday at St. Basil's Church with burial at Calvary Cemetery. Another funeral mass will be celebrated Friday night at St. Vibiana's Cathedral. Associated Press James Francis Cardinal McIntire"
Simone Veil of France Is Elected European Parliament's President,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/18/archives/simone-veil-of-france-is-elected-european-parliaments-president.html,"STRASBOURG, France, July 17 (AP) — The newly elected European Parliament opened its inaugural session here today by choosing Simone Veil of France as its first President. Mrs. Veil, a 52‐year‐old champion of liberal abortion laws and women's rights, served as Health Minister of France for five years before being elected to the Parliament of the nine‐nation European Common Market on June 10. She was chosen to preside over the 410‐member legislature today, on the second ballot. The Parliament, which previously consisted of members named by the national legislatures, has limited powers. It has some voice in the Common Market's budget and who spends it, but it cannot impose any decision on a national government. Its. chief power is expected to be, that of a moral force reflecting the views of the combined electorate of 180 million people. Mrs. Veil, who survived the Auschwitz death camp during World War II, was supported by the dominant center‐right bloc in the Parliament. But she had a strong rival in Mario Zagari, 65, a former Partisan fighter from Italy, who was backed by the 112‐member Socialist bloc. Mrs. Veil, who never ran for office be, fore her election to the European Parliament, has regularly topped polls in France as the most popular public official. She thinks the Parliament she will preside over can do a lot for West Europeans if it moves with “small steps” and does not try to impose supranational rules. “Trying to harmonize national laws,” she said in a recent interview, “is a much beter method, bringing countries into similar lines.” She was born in Nice July 13, 1927. Her mother died at Auschwitz, and her father and brother.ere also killed by the Nazis. After the war, she married a French Government'official; studied law and obtained a job in the ‐Ministry of Justice. Mrs. Veil was heading toward a career in penal affairs, she thought, when she was chosen for service in the French Cabinet. The European Parliament's opening session today was marked by an hourlong address by its oldest member, 86‐year‐old Louise Weiss, speaking as dean of the old nonelected chamber. She appealed to the delegates to fight for pan‐Europeanism, and she denounced the United. Nations as an organization that has failed to help the Vietnamese refugees. Mrs. Veil, dressed as usual in a longsleeved dress that covers the number 78651 tattooed on her arm by the Germans,. sat almost unnoticed in a back row. The Rev. Ian Paisley from Northern Ireland got the session off to a lively start by protesting that the British flag was flying upside down outside the Parlia ment, a comindb mistake. Several hundred demonstrators, mostly Italian, gathered outside to protest Mrs. Veil's record on abortion. Other groups urged federalism, a common European currency and the admission of small minority groups to the Parliament."
HOUSE PANEL CLEARS HOSPITAL COST BILL,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/18/archives/house-panel-clears-hospital-cost-bill-ways-and-means-vote-is-a.html,"WASHINGTON, July 17 — The House Ways and Means Committee approved a bill to contain hospital costs today and gave the Carter Administration a hardfought victory in its struggle against inflation. The vote was 22 to 14, but an amendment that would have crippled the legislation lost by only two votes. The proposal still faces a long and difficult battle on both sides of the Capitol. Critics contend that even if the bill does become law, weakening amendments will have left only a “shell.” But the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, Joseph A. Califano Jr., hailed the committee vote. “It's a $30 billion victory for the American people,” he told reporters outside the committee meetng room. “That's a hell of a lot more than a shell.” Estimates on Savings The Administration estimated that its original proposal would have saved $52 billion over five years in increased hospital costs, about $20 billion more than the estimate made by the Congressional Budget office. The Administration said today that the Ways and Means bill would save $28 billion over four years, but others made less optimistic projections. The bill gives hospitals a grace period in which they could hold down cost increases voluntarily. If the annual increase exceeded a certain figure, set at 11.6 percent in the Ways and Means bill, mandatory controls would automatically be put into effect. After committee members added a host of exceptions, many of which would protect their own local interests, only about 35 to 90 percent of the nation's hospitals would be covered. For instance, Representative Sam Gibbons, Democrat of Florida, moved to ease the burden on hospitals that serve large concentrations of elderly people. Another amendment approved today, offered by Representative J.J. Pickle of Texas, exempted children's hospitals. Added Procedural Changes In addition, the committee added two procedural changes opposed by the Administration. One imposed a “sunset” provision that would end the program after four years; another would allow either house to block any cost control program before it went into effect. Last week the Administration still needed one vote for passage, but over the weekend it won over Mr. Gibbons and Representative William Cotter, Democrat of Connecticut. As the price for their support, the Administration agreed to permit critics of the bill to offer an amendment on the floor that could virtually destroy the bill by removing its mandatory provisions. That amendment was defeated in committee today, but only by two votes. The House Commerce Committee has yet to take up the bill, but Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. has vowed to bring the issue to the floor in September, even if the committee fails to act. On the Senate side, the Human Resources Committee has approved a bill, but the Finance Committee has defeated it. The key battle will come on the Senate floor, possibly before the August recess. Abortion Curb Voted for Capital WASHINGTON, July 17 (UPI) — The House today included a ban on all Government financing of abortions in the District of Columbia as part of the district's $1.48 billion appropriation for 1980. The ban, proposed by Representative Robert K. Doman, Republican of California, is more stringent than that applied to the states. Mr. Dornan's amendment prohibits the use of any funds in the bill, including those raised by the district government, to pay for abortions. The abortion provisions for states bar the use of only Federal funds for abortions. Until now, the district government has chosen to use locally raised funds to pay for abortions for poor women. The House bill makes several reductions in the district's budget request. Efforts to restore some of the cuts were lost when supporters failed to offer their amendments at the appropriate time in debate."
Presidents Are Now Mayors,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/18/archives/presidents-are-now-mayors.html,"In the last generation, Presidents have come to act like mayors. They take on the meanest housekeeping concerns of daily existence, matters for which there are no ready answers and in which there is no political paydirt. These concerns were not the business of, Presidents historically, and grappling with them today quickly stains every Administration before it settles into place. A mere glance at the “Public Papers of the Presidents” for the last two decades or so provides a sample of the matters the chief executives have offered opinions and policies, on: the care of high school dropouts, the controlling of hospital costs, the cure of violent crime, the elimination of hazardous toys, the cleansing of polluted air, the distribution of information on birth control, including abortion — not to speak of the scientific ambiguities arising from nuclear generators, the fall of Skylab, and the fear of a flu epidemic. The list has end. The deglamorizing of the Presidency has not come about solely because of Watergate and a reduced public exposure to the notes of “Hail to the Chief.” It has been accomplished by the kind of work America has given the chief to do, and that he has accepted so unflinchingly. Harry S. Truman declared the Presidential rule to be “The buck stops here”; his successort, with the help of the people, have invented a corollary: “Never let the buck, stop short or the top.” The White House has. become the dumping ground of last resort for society's unsolved and unsolvable technological, social and econOmit issues — most of them so complex that they would tax the mind of a polymath. No President can grow tall and popular by digging into the detritus of local government. The mayors, who have had a powerful hand in ratcheting it upward to the Oval Office, know well that the effort to handle it is not the road to political advancement and acclaim. Franklin D. Roosevelt was the first President to make his agenda thick and detailed. As his Administration began in 1933, he said that he did not expect to make a hit every time he came to bat. But he did not expect to be at bat incessantly either — as mayors must be and as Presidents now are. Few mayors bat very well. But Presidents who hit only .200 are not heroes in the tough league of history. No state visit abroad can redeem a President exhausted by the pitching at home. He may, if he chooses, cavort on foreign soil, but he does so as a joyful escapee; he cannot be a symbol of strength and accomplishment. A President‐turned‐mayor, the public is daily aware, is a man struck dumb. Good oratory is the active ingredient of good leadership. But the best of speechwriters can find no lofty, eloquent words to enthrall the people when the subject is the dreggy problems of everyday living — as all mayors know. The ..choicest of the Presidents have used the English language as an indispensable tool. Lincoln imbued the word “freedom” with magic; Wilson ennobled the word “democracy”; F.D.R. and Truman gave force to the conception of “leader of the free world.” Their voices and messages sounded as if they came from Olympus itself because their personas had not been damaged by fruitless and unending struggles over base and intractable business. Today's Presidents, soon swamped by an excess of low duties, discover that their Address is their last hurrah. The debilitating of the Presidency has been under way for some time. Confrontation politics have eroded the old channels of communication and weakened all authority below the President. The growth of the welfare state has focused public attention on Washington as the principal source of help and money if not of ideas and solutions. The development of television has made every President a busybee President — indeed, an actor who must continually sound like a Solon on all questions small as well as great. The present tendencies may have had their beginnings during the anthracite‐coal strike of 1902 — the first national fuel crisis — when Theodore Roosevelt personally involved himself in the bargaining between the union leaders and the mine operators. He had attended to the words of his old friend Henry Cabot Lodge, then junior Senator from Massachusetts: “Is there nothing we can appear to do?” The substitution of appearance for reality has in our own day increasingly gone hand‐in‐hand with the overloading of the Presidency. Reversing this trend should now be the first and most essential task if we are to rescue the office from paralysis and decay. The challenge is to nothing less than the vaunted American genius for self‐government, for the President cannot display the peerless leadership public yearns for and deal with the great issues as a statesman if he lives the life of a mayor‐housekeeper and wears that unhappy drudge's harried face."
Clinic Staffers Suffer Emotional Traumas Too,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/20/archives/clinic-staffers-suffer-emotional-traumas-too.html,"How do the people who help women go through abortions with as much emotional equanimity as is possible feel about the work they do? That question was the focus of what was probably the most personal of the seminars conducted at the National Abortion Federation meeting: it was entitled “Staff Burn‐Out.” Burn‐out signifies the emotional fatigue suffered by people who continuously confront individuals in highly charged emotional situations. Although said to occur frequently among abortion providers and counselors, it is endemic to almost all segments of the medical and helping professions. Its symptoms include stress, boredom, irritability, depression and a sense of helplessness. Glenna Halvorson‐Boyd, administrative director of the Fairmount Center, a private abortion facility in Dallas, explained, “Burn‐out is what happens to us in a situation when we stop processing our own feelings, when we stop meeting our own needs. And the abortion situation happens to be loaded with feelings.” To the woman contemplating an abortion, “We grant permission to feel all that she feels and to deal with it in her own way,” she said. “Yet we seldom extend such consideration to ourself. We must be clearheaded, rational, sure at all times.” Mrs. Halvorson‐Boyd said she first began to understand the phenomenon several years ago when she encountered an 18‐year‐old mother who had experienced three pregnancies in two years, one ending in a miscarriage, one in the death of a baby two days after its birth. The woman was opposed to abortion but unable to endure yet another pregnancy. “It came to me almost as a surprise, I needed to cry, too,” she recalled. There are those who would use burnout as evidence that, as Mrs. Boyd‐Halvorson said, “all us abortion folks are burning out because deep down inside we really know that we are killing babies and it finally gets to us.” But, she emphasized, “That is wrong. That has not been our experience at the Fairmount Center. I do not believe I am a baby killer. I do not believe I am doing something wrong. I believe I am doing important work, and I believe I am doing it well, and I have feelings about the work I do.”"
'80 Race Seen as Factor,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/20/archives/80-race-seen-as-factor-califano-cites-politics-and-feuds.html,"WASHINGTON, July 19 — Joseph A. Califano Jr. said today that President Carter had told him he was being dismissed as Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare because of friction between the Secretary and top White House staff members and because the President “had to get the Cabinet and the Administration ready for the 1980 election.” He said he was not told how his departure would help the President win re‐election, but his 30‐month tenure as head of the largest Government agency was marked by controversy. He offended ,powerful political interests in the South Iwith his campaign against cigarette smoking and his attempts to increase racial integration in the state university system in North Carolina. But sources close to‐Mr. Califano, an old‐style liberal of the Lyndon Johnson mold, said that his relations with the White House staff, particularly with Hamilton Jordan, the new chief of staff, were troubled from the beginning. “He was there only five weeks when he called me to say Jordan was out to get him,” said Ralph Nader, the consumer activist, who said he had recommended Mr. Califano, a Brooklyn‐born lawyer now 48 years old, for the post. Allies of the hard‐driving and self‐confident Secretary portrayed him as a victim of “amateurs” in the White House, jealous of his skill in dealing with Congress and of his good relations with the press, and, perhaps most importantly, resentful of his independence. He developed a reputation for refusing to accept political appointments pressed on him by the White House and he used his access to Mr. Carter to win his battles with the staff by appealing directly to the President. “Inevitably, there will be those who will say, in trying to explain this event, that I made waves,” Mr. Califano said today at a news conference. “I hope I did.” The precise nature of the White House's unhappiness with Mr. Califano could not be determined because, according to sources in the Administration, Mr. Jordan ordered the staff to avoid criticizing the dismissed Cabinet members. After meeting with the President last night and again this morning, Mr. Califano received a hand‐written note from the President accepting his resignation “with a genuine feeling of appreciation.” The Secretary then called a news conference, where he seemed at ease. “When he met with me yesterday he told me the performance over here had been superb,” Mr. Califano said. He added that his qualities— he cited leadership, drive, management and independence — were “the same qualities that created friction with certain members of the staff.” Mr. Califano said the President told him that his chief detractors in the White House were Mr. Jordan; James T. McIntyre Jr., director of the Office of Management and Budget; Jody Powell, the press secretary, and Frank B. Moore, the Congressional liaison aide. Although he resisted such suggestions, Mr. Califano is known to consider himself a scapegoat. While he is not overly close to Senator Edward M. Kennedy, he is understood to feel that Mr. Carter's political operatives link him to the Massachusetts Democrat, who poses an undeclared threat to the President's renomination. Mr. Califano was deeply distrusted at the White House, according to several persons in a position to know, even though he served as a lightning rod for the President on a number of controversial issues, such as school desegregation, the allocation of money for women in collegiate sports, and abortion, which Mr. Califano opposed. The Secretary gained the enmity of Mr. McIntyre in numerous battles over the H.E.W. budget, particularly concerning money for educating the poor. The Secretary almost invariably managed to reverse the Budget Office decisions by calling the President."
Dismissals Taken as Pre‐Campaign Move by Carter,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/20/archives/dismissals-taken-as-precampaign-move-by-carter-news-analysis.html,"WASHINGTON, July 19 — President Carter's first two Cabinet dismissals were widely seen today as confirmation that he had begun his undeclared campaign for re‐election by moving to shore up his standing with important constituencies and replacing those officials he regarded as political liabilities. But the actions prompted an uproar of criticism in Congress. News Analysis The negative reaction went far beyond support for the two discharged Cabinet members, W. Michael Blumenthal and Joseph A. Califano Jr., to concerns about whether the Carter Administration was stable and assertions that the President had dissipated much. of the momentum and good will generated by his address to the nation last Sunday night. “I fear a huge opportunity has been wasted,” said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York. “The immediate impact is overwhelmingly negative,” said Representative Benjamin Rosenthal, another New York Democrat. “Everyone around here is very, very disgusted. I'm genuinely worried about the stability of the country. What he wants — team players — is a legitimate element, but the destruction of confidence in our Government is hardly Worth it.” Others, even moderate Democrats, warned that the way the Cabinet replacements had been handled was reminiscent of the methods of President Nixon and would hasten movements toward Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts or Vice President Mondale as an alternative to Mr. Carter for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1980. On the whole, the reaction of the nation's leading Democrats was negative. [Page A8.] But partisans in the Carter camp, such as John C. White, the Democratic national chairman, were encouraged. “I'm happy, I'm pretty keyed up,” Mr. White said. “Politically there are some obvious gains.” The Administration's calculation was that the appointment of G. William Miller, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, as the new TreaSury Secretary would bolster its standing with the business community. It was also hoping to revitalize its sagging popularity among blacks by naming Patricia Roberts Harris, now Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, to be the first black to head H.E.W., the Government's largest domestic agency. Moreover, the President's political lieutenants were angling for support in the South by urging dismissal of Mr. Califano, who has stirred controversy in that region with his antismoking campaign. Tobacco State Reaction “I think Mr. Califano was a good place for the President to start in restructuring his Cabinet,” asserted Senator Walter Huddleston, a Kentucky Democrat. But the risks of the Carter tactics for imposing tighter discipline on his Administration as he approaches the campaign were highlighted by an immediate volley of criticism not only from Republicans and alienated Democratic liberals but also from moderate Democrats. One of the most influential, middle‐ofthe road Democrats in the House, David R. Obey of Wisconsin, called the dismissals “a victory for mediocrity — a dunderheaded performance” and warned that they would weaken the President's chances of renomination. “It is inconceivable to me that they should dismiss the only truly effective Secretary of H.E.W. I have seen in my 10 years in Congress while retaining secondand third‐raters” such as Budget Director James T. McIntyre, Chief of Staff Hamilton Jordan, and others, he declared. “I suspect that the actions being taken will accelerate people's search for other choices in 1980, such as Fritz Mondale or Ted Kennedy.” The tone of Representative Obey's comments was echoed across much of the ideological spectrum. Democrats expressed fears that it would look as though, in the interests of discipline and tighter control by Mr. Jordan and his inner circle, the President was opposed to dissent and diversity within his Administration. The dismissals, suggested Representative Toby Moffett, a Connecticut Democrat, could have a “chilling effect” on other Cabinet members. Within Mr. Carter's inner circle, both Mr. Califano and Mr. Blumenthal were regarded as too outspoken, difficult to work with, and independent‐minded to the point of occasional disloyalty to the President. In Mr. Blumenthal's case, these political strategists contended that the departing Treasury Secretary was a loner who had not won the trust and confidence of the business community — a charge contested today by a number of influential businessmen to whom President Carter has often turned for advice. In the case of Mr. Califano, the White House entourage had argued that he had not only offended the tobacco states but had angered other voters with rulings on desegregation and abortion. Both dismissals, but especially that of Mr. Califano, flowed naturally from the strong anti‐Washington theme to which President Carter has recently returned. In many respects, Mr. Califano is the quintessential Washington insider — an influential and well known Washington laywer who served as President Johnson's top domestic policy aide and drafted many of the Great Society programs that have become targets of the Administration's fiscal conservatism. Further, Mr. Califano has moved in Washington circles in which the. Georgia entourage around Mr. Carter is uncomfortable. Finally, Drastic Measures For more than a year, outside advisers had counseled President Carter to make some changes in his Cabinet, but he had persistently put off action. Not until he had been running very low in the opinion polls, far behind Senator Kennedy, did he comment to Others that he felt this was draining his presidential authority and undermining his ability to reach the public. Not until then was he ready for drastic measures. “People want him to lead,” said Senator Alan Cranston, Democrat of California, “and now he's seeking to assert his leadership and he should be given an opportunity to lead.” The prevalent initial reaction in Congress that Mr. Carter was evoking memories of Mr. Nixon's discharge of Archibald Cox, the Watergate special prosecutor, and the subsequent resignation of Attorney General Elliot L. Richardson, brought a rebuttal from Robert Strauss, the President's Middle East negotiator and a key political adviser. “There's no disorder, no Saturday night massacre,” Mr. Strauss said. “The President is going about it in an orderly and responsible way.” Parallels With Ford But Thomas Cronin, a Presidential scholar at the University of Delaware recalled that similar Cabinet shake‐ups had been politically costly in the past. In November 1975, President Ford dismissed James R. Schlesinger as Secretary of Defense, accepted the resignation of William E. Colby as Director of Central Intelligence, and let it be known that Vice President Nelson A. Rockefeller would not be his running mate — all in one week. “It was a boomerang, fur Furd,” commented Professor Cronin. “lie was trying to look tough, and it didn't work. When you have to fire someone when you're really down politically, it's sign of weakness. The problem for Carter is that it shows him flexing his muscles, but it's not good timing.”"
"Abortion Rights in Peril, Say Advocates at Conference",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/20/archives/abortion-rights-in-peril-say-advocates-at-conference-this-is-a.html,"The call to battle was sounded by speaker after speaker the third annual meeting of the National Abortion Federation held here this week. The message: those who support the right of women to terminate their pregnancies must strengthen their efforts to defend that right against recurrent threats to its survival. Some 400 abortion clinic administrators and personnel, along with physicians, lawyers, government officials, researchers and health rights’ activists, heard such warnings as the one issued by Representative Theodore S. Weiss, Democrat of Manhattan. The Congressman described the position of groups in Washington advocating abortion as “being on the defensive.” “We have been out‐worked and out‐organized, and we have a long way to go.” Mr. Weiss said. “You must organize as effectively politically as the opposition has.” William R. Baiid, the birth control and abortion activist, had a particularly pessimistic outlook. “I predict the end the abortion law within two or three years,” he told the audience at a panel on acts of violence aimed at clinics. On the same day, Terry Beresford, director of counseling and training for Planned Parenthood of Maryland, who had just been elected president of the federation, announced that it was establishing a legislative action committee and would assume a more aggressive posture. The federation comprises 160 abortion facilities, some private, some nonprofit, as well as other advocacy organizations and individuals. ‘This Is a Burning Issue’ Robin Chandler Duke, president of the National Abortion Rights Action League, or NARAL, said, “This is a burning issue. We have a law and there are serious efforts to erode that law.” Those efforts and how to counteract them dominated the four‐day conclave in Marriott's Essex House. The participarits took a comprehensive look at the political, legal, medical and social issues confronting supporters of the right to abortion, who prefer who describe themselves as “prochoice.” As many participants at the conference observed, the history of abortion rights has been dotted with brush fires ever since the. Supreme Court made abortion a constitutional right in 1973. Frank Sussman, a lawyer and treasurer of the federation, said during the seminar on minors, “Every court decision in favor of abortion is followed by legislation that restricts it. And every restrictive law is followed by another court decision.” Ongoing controversies seem to defy agreement even among those on tine same side of the fence. Among the most troublesome is the question of government regulation. Some participants feared that the imposition of new government standards would limit the accessibility of abortion. Numerous instances of impediments to the provision abortion were cited. For example, Jonell Davis, a legislative analyst for NARAL, pointed out, “Twelve clinics have been burned or bombed in the last 18 months.” In one of the most serious instances, the Bill Baird Center in Hempstead, L.I., was destroyed by an intruder who threw gasoline and a flaming torch onto the premises, according Mr. Baird. Fifty people were forced to flee the building. Other obstacles were less dangerous but interfered with the daily routines of numerous clinics. Susan Hill, executive director of the National Women's Health Organization, which operates nine private clinics around the country, asserted, “The Zoning Board in Fort Wayne, Ind., denied us parking permit before we even opened. We had to sue the board,” she said. Sharon McCann of the Northern Virginia Women's Medical Center in Fairfax, Va., bad to obtain an injunction stop demonstrators from trespassing. “Three months ago, someone broke in and left a 14‐week‐old fetus in our sink,” she said. The Feminist Women's Health Center in Tallahassee has had an ongoing battle with the medical establishment in that Florida city since it opened in 1975. Linda Curtis, the director, said, “The Florida Board of Medical Examiners tried close the clinic by pressuring doctors to stop working with us, and‐ within three, months we were boycotted by all the doctors.” The clinic is now suing five physicians and the executive director of the Florida Board of Examiners for conspiracy in restraint of trade. For the present, the issues that the conferees considered to have the most serious consequences are the Hyde Amendment and the Akron Ordinance. The Hyde Amendment is a rider that has been attached every year since 1977 to the bill that appropriates funds for the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Initially, it cut off Medicaid funds for abortions except in cases which the woman's life was clearly in danger. Since then other exceptions have been allowed — after protracted fights in Congress — including conception caused by rape or incest and those in which continuation of the pregnancy would create certifiable severe and long‐lasting threats health. The Senate voted yesterday to maintain the amendment in 1980 but, as in the past, its version allowed more liberal exceptions to the prohibition than the bill passed recently by the House, which would pay for abortions only when the mother's life was in danger. A conference committee will attempt to come up with a compromise bill. In addition, a decision is pending in the case of McCrae v. Califano in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, which could have wide implications. The plaintiff charged that the Hyde Amendment is unconstitutional because it discriminates on religious grounds. That premise is based on the amendment's assumption that the fetus is a human being from the moment of conception. In the absence of any national ruling on its constitutionality — a Federal District Court in Illinois held that both the Hyde Amendment and a state statute violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment — the Hyde Amendment seems to have prevailed. Although the amendment never stipulated that states stop reimbursing their half of the Medicaid payments for abortions, 39 have, in fact, done so. At the.seminar on the Hyde Amendment, Barbara Lindhelm, a research associate with the Alan Guttmacher Institute, said that only nine states, including New York, and one jurisdiction, the District of Columbia, have continued to foot the bills for Medicaid abortion patients. Connecticut and New Jersey allow them with restrictions. Before the Hyde Amendment went into effect in late August 1977, the Federal and state governments paid out $87 million for 295,000 Medicaid abortions perforthed that year. Seventy percent of them had been done in states that have discontinued paying for them, she said. While the Hyde Aniendment is considered to be a barrier directly aimed at what Robin Duke called “the most defenseless segment of society: the poor,” the Akron Ordinance and eight local laws patterned after it were written apply to all women in the appropriate geographical jurisdictions. All are currently enjoined by court action, but prospects of the injunctions being lifted have caused concern. The Akron Ordinance, passed by the City Council of the Ohio city in February 1978, imposes conditions for the provision of abortion. Janet Benshoof, a lawyer with the Reproductive Freedom Project of the American. Civil Liberties Union, said that among the ordinance's provisions was one that “requires the doctor to inform a woman that she is destroying a human being from the moment of conception.” She added, “He is also required to give a fetal description appropriate to her time of gestation and to recite to her the complications of abortion including sterilization, infertility, psychological distress perhaps resulting in suicide.” In addition, Miss Benshoof said, the ordinances frequently Call for restrictions on a minor's right to obtain abortion (earlier this month, the Supreme Court struck down a Massachusetts statute requiring minors to get the consent of either their parents or a judge to have an abortion), spousal consent, waiting periods, and that second trimester procedures be performed in hospitals."
The Seeds Of Violence,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/21/archives/the-seeds-of-violence.html,"When a high school girl was pushed off a subway platform by an unidentified teenager — for no apparent reason — many people wondered what kind of person would do such a thing. I don't have to wonder. I know. The assailant could have been a former student of mine. For three years I taught emotionally disturbed children in a school funded, tenuously, by the city and state of New York. Most of the students were from impoverished backgrounds, and could no longer function in the public‐school system. For some, it was the last step before residential treatment. Before teaching reading and math, the teachers all agreed that socialization came first. While public‐school children made field trips to museums, I took my pupils to the grocery store to teach them how to wait on line and count change. Instead of discussing literature, we talked about solving problems with words instead of fists. Violence was an integral part of their lives. The violence often began at home, where parents beat their children. Ten‐year‐old Amy came to class with cigarette burns on her arm. They had been inflicted by her mother ‐ for no apparent reason. Distraught, Amy kept antagonizing others so that I had to physically guard her so that they couldn't hit her. Her social worker should have seen her immediately; because her caseload was too large, she could not spend time with Amy until late afternoon. Too many questions were left unanswered. William, for example, had been improving for the first time in years — both emotionally and academically — when he was threatened by an older student. His teacher tried to keep him inside the classroom in order to prevent a fight. But William's mind became fixed only on retaliation, and he knocked over anything that stood between him and the door which happened to be his teacher. She might have been a chair or any inanimate object; it didn't matter as William punched her head several times, resulting in a concussion that put her out of work for the rest of the year. When William was asked why he had hit the teacher he'd been so fond of, his eyes glazed over. “I hit my teacher?” he asked. “When?” ‘I hit my teacher?’ he asked. ‘When?’ Maybe the teenager who pushed the girl off the platform has blanked out his act of violence, too. Like William, he may not have been in control; he may not even remember the incident. But even if the police find him, the problem will not be solved. He is just one of thousands who cannot find solace through parents and schools, who are in need of therapy and possibly medication, who may continue to commit seemingly senseless acts of violence because it is all they know. Rudy was a frail, harmless‐looking boy who enjoyed sitting in my lap and listening to fairy tales; frequently he wrote me love notes. One afternoon he refused to leave when the afternoon bell rang. When I tried to coax him, he threw a pair of scissors at me. By the time the principal arrived, he was kicking, biting and cursing the three adults it took to contain him. There was a blank expression in his eyes that I had never seen before. Rudy was suspended until a residential treatment placement could be found, which took months and which meant he'd be at home and unsupervised. It wasn't until the day after his outburst that we discovered Rudy's father had left home. If our counseling staff had been adequate, Rudy might have had someone to talk to and the incident might have been prevented. Rudy couldn't even face me when he returned to pick up his belongings. He left behind one last note: “I'm sorry.” And it goes on and on. Without preventive measures, how can we expect to eliminate more acts of violence by troubled children? They must be identified early. Too often they reach junior high school before being placed in special classes. Well‐trained teachers, supplemented by enough social workers and psychiatrists within the schools are a necessity. Family counseling is a must, since it is impossible to help disturbed children who have to go home to drunken, psychopathic, or indifferent parents. Such was the case with Ellen. After being forced to accompany her mother while she had an abortion, Ellen's behavior became erratic, more aggressive than usual. Perhaps she was afraid that her mother might get rid of her, too. She became uncontrollably violent, throwing desks and chairs around, deliberately inciting others. She was suspended until her mother agreed to enroll her in psychotherapy, a service that was not provided in our school. Since her mother wasn't competent to follow through, Ellen never returned to our school. The last I heard, she was roaming the streets. Today she may be roaming the subways."
An Engineer to Get Portugal Moving,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/21/archives/an-engineer-to-get-portugal-moving-maria-de-lurdes-ruivo-da-silva.html,"LISBON, July 20 — In the heady, stormy days of 1974, Col. Vasco Gonsalves, the left‐wing Prime Minister of the Portuguese revolutionary Government, would greet the arrival of his sole woman minister at Cabinet meetings with a mildly sarcastic: “Here comes our flower.” The taming of the revolution has swept away many personalities from those times. But yesterday one of them, Maria de Lurdes Ruivo da Silva Matos Pintassilgo, the “flower” of the Gongalves Cabinet, made a striking reentry on the political scene. From a list of seven names, President Antonio Ramalho Eanes picked the 49‐year‐old engineer and diplomat to become Prime Minister of the 11th government since the collapse of the Salazar dictatorship in 1979. She will be the first woman to be head of government in Portugal. Woman in the News The appointment of the forceful Miss Pintassilgo — her name means goldfinch — was greeted with anger and consternation by the Portuguese right, which has come to believe that political affairs are drifting in its direction. O Pais, a far‐right daily, labeled her “a rather controversial person, who under the previous regime did not hide her adhesion to advanced ideological currents.” It also called her a progressive and a “third‐worldist.” Another daily recalled that she had spoken out in favor of legalized abortion, an issue that has stirred deep debate in a country where the Roman Catholic Church has an important voice. Defies Easy Categorization But Miss Pintassilgo, who has never married, defies easy categorization. She is a longtime Roman Catholic feminist who lives in a Lisbon commune with a group of women from Graal, a Catholic lay organization. While she plunged eagerly into the revolutionary ferment of 1974, serving as Minister of Social Affairs, she had earlier served as an appointed member of a quasi‐legislative chamber of the Salazar regime. “She is very open to the historical currents of the times,” said a woman friend who has worked closely with Miss Pintassilgo on study groups on the condition of women in Portugal. “She is very open to people, it's easy to get in touch with her,” the friend added. “The commune where she lives has a very international atmosphere: Someone always answers the phone in Spanish, French or some other language. She is very generous and very understanding. But she is also very strong‐willed.” In the first, anxious months of the revolution when the Communists appeared to be in the ascendant, two influential officers in the left‐leaning Armed Forces Movement, Vitor Alves and Ernesto Melo Antunes, introduced Miss Pintassilgo to a little‐known major named Eanes. She and the major became fast friends, and later, in political crises, President Eanes has floated her name as a possible nonparty prime minister. Faces Highly Delicate Task Colonel Alves and Colonel Antunes, now both members of the watchdog Council of the Revolution, are known to have discreetly advanced her candidacy, which is another reason for the explosion of outrage on the right. Miss Pintassilgo, who since mid‐1975 has been Portugal's UNESCO delegate in Paris, now faces the delicate task of putting together a government that according to the President will be a neutral referee in the elections for Parliament expected to be held in late Octo ber. The President has insisted that the caretaker government's program be approved before Parliament is for mally dissolved, a possibly tricky hurdle for the new Prime Minister. Once the elections are over, Miss Pintassilgo will in theory step aside for a prime minister of the winning party or coalition. But, as many politicians believe that the balloting will produce another stalemate, there is speculation that she could be around beyond October. If, as in the past, the parties cannot put together a stable government, President Eanes might renew her mandate. In the coming days, Miss Pintassilgo will have to assemble a cabinet willing to take on jobs that could end in three months. A chemical engineer by training, an unusual accomplishment for a woman in Portugal, the new Prime Minister likes to be called “Engineer.” In a country where men have for the last five years badly muddied the political waters, this woman, born to a middle‐class family in Abrantes on Jan. 18, 1930, now has a chance to succeed. “Perhaps,” one newspaper observed wistfully, “a woman can bring off the miracle so greatly desired.”"
Mrs. Harris Is Expected To Alter H.E.W. Subtly,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/21/archives/mrs-harris-is-expected-to-alter-hew-subtly-the-abortion-issue.html,"WASHINGTON, July 20 — Though Patricia Roberts Harris and Joseph A. Califano Jr. are Democratic social liberals of the same mold, it is expected here that Mrs. Harris will bring some subtle changes in emphasis when she takes over from Mr. Califano as Secretary of Health, Edducation and Welfare. “You'll never see her fooling around with cigarettes — her issues are the great social issues, welfare, civil rights, education,” said a high official close to Mrs. Harris, who is now Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. The official was referring to Mr. Califano's much‐publicized crusade against smoking, which reportedly contributed to his fall from political grace. Mrs. Harris, a party stalwart, has earned a reputation for being a team player despite frequent philosophical differences with an essentially conservative Administration. For the record, she has taken pains to stress continuity with Mr. Califano's policies. “I'm not aware of anything Califano did that I'm prepared, at this time, to change,” she said at a news conference yesterday, adding, “Nobody should take any comfort from my appointment who's looking for changes in policy.” The Abortion Issue Asked today whether she would depart from Mr. Califano's stand against publicly financed abortions, she said through a spokesman: “I have made a habit of not differing with Administration decisions.” President Carter opposes a constitutional amendment banning abortion, but also is against the use of Federal funds to pay for abortions. Mrs. Harris is expected to continue to press for her new department's main legislative priorities: welfare reform, national health insurance and containing hospital costs, all of which are hitting rough waters in Congress. But the key question in many minds is how she will remain a team player while serving as an effective advocate for a department whose main mission, helping the poor and vulnerable, is at odds with the general political climate. “The interesting question is how the White House is going to deal with the exact same set of problems now that they have put in a team player,” said an aide to Mr. Califano. “You cannot be inert on a lot of these issues.” One of her first problems will be to repair relations with Congress. Mr. Califano's dismissal enraged key Democratic members concerned with domestic policy, such as Charles B. Rangel of Manhat. tan, chairman of the Subcommittee on Health of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. Rangel said today that the change of secretaries would cause “legislative problems” for many key bills, but that he respected and liked Mrs. Harris. As a black woman who has worked as a civil rights lawyer, Mrs. Harris is generally expected to push hard on school integration, and few observers expected the North Carolina state university system, which is under threat of loss of Federal aid because it has failed to satisfy H.E.W. on desegregation, to find much relief in her appointment. While she is tough, Mrs. Harris is unlikely to walk blindly into controversies that will embarrass the President. Therefore, many expect her to move cautiously, at least until the President wins reelection. One lobbyist predicted that she would engage in a “holding operation.” Her appointment, however, buoyed abortion rights advocates. While she has not spoken on the issue explicitly, as a woman and black she is widely thought to have a more liberal view on the issue than Mr. Califano, a Roman Catholic. Karen Mulbauser, head of the National Abortion Rights Action League, said that she expected Mrs. Harris to be “less rigid” than Mr. Califano in interpreting the law that prohibits the use of Federal funds to perform abortions. Apart from issues, the appointment is likely to bring a new style of operation at H.E.W., a complex agency that is the largest and most disjointed in government. Mr. Califano is said to have offended many in the department by relying mostly on a small coterie of bright young assistants. “She does not stand in a corner with three special assistants and make a decision,” said an associate at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. “She will use her assistant secretaries.”"
POLITICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/22/archives/connecticut-weekly-politics-stamfords-conservative-voice-in-the.html,"STAMFORD STATE Senator Richard H. G. Cunningham refuses to be discouraged. He prides himself on pushing forward in the face of adversity and refers often to Abraham Lincoln's setbacks. The conservative freshman legislator introduced many bills this year, most of which died quickly. When he stood up in the Senate to expound his ideas, his colleagues frequently vacated the chamber, using the time for lunch or legislative chores rather than listen to the Senator's predictable speeches. Even his campaign literature drew attention to his political defeats. In 1974 he lost his bid for the State Senate, as he pointed out, by the largest margin for a Senate race in Stamford history. In 1976 he ran for Congress on a thirdparty ticket and was defeated by a 40‐to‐1 margin. Last year Mr. Cunningham ran what was widely expected to be a losing battle for the State Senate against the popular incumbent, William E. Strada Jr. But shortly before the election The Stamford Advocate reported that Mr. Strada's law firm had received a $50,000 fee from a Rhode Island gambing syndicate at a time when Mr. Strada introduced a bill to legalize jai alai and dog racing in Connecticut. Mr. Strada denied that there was any conflict of interest, but lost the election to Mr. Cunningham by 2,000 votes. The success has lifted Mr. Cunningham's ambitions again, and now he says he would like to run for Representative Stewart B. McKinney's seat in Congress next year if Mr. McKinney decides to pull out for reasons of health or to run for higher office, such as Abraham A. Ribicoff's Senate seat. Mr. Cunningham spoke of his political ambitions and his legislative goals for next year's session of the General Assembly while sitting in his Stamford office, located in a warehouse next to the rail line. With his two brothers, Mr. Cunningham, helps run the family business, Cunningham Industries, which makes noncircular gears. Mr. Cunningham, a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Duke University Law School, also uses the office for his law practice, which he said he had drastically cut back to avoid any conflict of interest as a legislator. Along with a few real‐estate transactions, Mr. Cunningham said he had only one case going to trial this year — a medical malpractice suit against a dentist. The office, a clutter of furnishings that might have come from a Good Will Industries warehouse, is adjacent to the shop, where three machines run by computers make such things as elliptical gears and logarithmic spiral gears. Mr. Cunningham declined to say how much money he earned from the family business. At another point in the conversation, however, he mentioned that his brother Fred lived in Greenwich and rode jumping horses as a hobby; the implication would seem to be that the brothers make a comfortable living from the business. Mr. Cunningham talked at length of crime during the interview. Much of his thinking about politics and about the legislation he wants is linked to combating crime. Next year, he says, he will work for a bill on mandatory sentencing for criminals with some discretion for judges. He also wants more prison facilities built because the current ones are overcrowded and “the only real way to decrease crime is to increase the likelihood of punishment.” He became known in the Legislature this year for the number of bills he introduced having to do with marriage. These have their base in Mr. Cunningham's view of the causes of crime. He worries about the “breakdown of the family structure,” and says he has done an intensive study of statistics that “show a relationship between divorce and crime.” Quoting a survey of prison inmates done in the 1930's by the University of Indiana, Mr. Cunningham said that it showed 30 percent came from broken families. Today, he notes, 60 perCent of marriages in Connecticut end in divorce. Thus, he introduced a number of bills that would have made divorce difficult; all of them were defeated. One proposed bill would have had the effect of ending Connecticut's “no‐fault divorce.” Another would have ended alimony payments to an “unfaithful, adulterous spouse.” In order to “prevent marriage counseling from becoming a situation in which a counselor having substantial psychological influence can use that influence in a manner detrimental to a marriage,” Mr. Cunningham proposed a bill providing for suits against marriage counselors. He also introduced a bill to prevent a spouse from suing for divorce on the ground of any act for which the spouse had previously been forgiven; for instance, if a man beat his wife, the wife could not use that as a basis for a lawsuit if earlier she had forgiven him for Mr. Cunningham, also gained some attention around the capital during the last session by supporting a bill to legalize polygamy. “That was a joke,” he said, explaining that the intention of the bill, which was killed, had been to strengthen the law recognizing foreign marriages, but had the accidental effect of legalizing polygamy. His biggest success of the year was the “workfare” bill. Although it was eventually defeated, the issue was thoroughly debated, to the surprise of many of Mr. Cunningham's colleagues. The original bill would have set up mandatory work programs for welfare recipients. In his fight against increasing welfare payments, Mr. Cunningham, who is married to the former Linda Couch and has six children, put his family on welfare budget for a month. He reported that if it had not been for his housing payment, which was more than most welfare recipients would have been paying, and for an automobile repair bill of $180, he would have been able to live very comfortably. A Reagan supporter, Mr. Cunningham espouses a reduced role for government and a strong, well‐funded military. Citing his beliefs as a member of the Church of Christ, he advocates laws abolishing abortion. He thinks “public housing is a curse,” and that the salvation of cities is not financial aid but an effective program to reduce crime. He says he is “tired of our system of coddling criminals.” Although it may seem “obvious that if we eliminate drug pushers we would eliminate the drug problem,” he stresses: “That is wrong.” He says that “we must dry up the demand. We've got to punish them for robbing people, burglarizing homes, muggings, murders, etc.” He is not, he says, unsympathetic to poor people who have been demoral ized by our social system. In his quest for the preservation of the family, Mr. Cunningham wants to reform our tax structure so there is a “maximum incentive to earn and save.” Although he opposes a state income tax, Mr. Cunningham wants the Federal system to be replaced by a flat 20 percent tax on income with a $45‐a‐month rebate for each person. “The wealthy would not object to paying a fair rate of tax on income,” he said flatly. “It would relieve them of the efforts to take advantage of tax loopholes. It would be more efficient.”"
He Managed His Job With Gusto and Zeal — and Probably Too Much of Both,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/22/archives/califano-had-all-the-connections-except-one.html,"His best friends are people like Edward Bennett Williams, the famous trial lawyer, and Philip Geyelin, the former editorial page editor of The Washington Post. He holds season tickets to Washington Redskins football games, eats lunch on Saturdays at Duke Zeibert's and has brunch on Sundays at Doc Dalinsky's drugstore. He is on a first‐name basis with every important Congressman, lawyer and columnist in the city and spent eight years in private law practice between the Johnson and Carter Administrations earning a fortune pulling strings in the capital for corporate clients. Joseph A. Califano Jr. has, in short, more Washington connections than the White House switchboard. That, in the eyes of President Carter's staff, not of Mr. Carter himself, proved to be his undoing an Administration that is campaigning against Washington. That, and the fact that Mr. Califano, having worked in the White House himself, repeat. edly bypassed staff on policy and budgetary matters and went straight to the President. If Mr. Califano was political liability, it was because he served as a lightning rod, absorbing the shock from the Administration's stands on controversial issues. One rarely heard about President Carter's policy on abortions or smoking or school desegration or women in intercollegiate athletics. The fire was almost always directed at Mr. Califano. So, it was not a qu6stion of loyalty that led to Joe Califano's ouster. Rather, it was a question of style. He surrounded himself with brilliant young men and women — by most accounts, the best staff in the Government — willing willing to work long hours in unglamorous jobs because of their devotion to him. He was never particularly close to the Kennedys (he was Lyndon Johnson man), but he did not shun the Kennedys either. He got along famously with Stuart E. Eizenstat, head of the President's domestic policy staff, but made no secret around Washington of his contempt for Hamilton Jordan, the chief of staff, James T. McIntyre Jr., the budget director, and Frank B. Moore, head of the White House Congressional liaison team. Indeed, when he was briefing senior Congressmen last month on .the Administration's national health insurance proposal, he insisted on briefing alone. White House staff members, commanded by Mr. Jordan to keep silent or lose their jobs too, refused last week to discuss Mr. Califano. During the last year, however, here are some of the things they have said. One called Mr. Califano “crazy,” “hyperactive,” and “imbalanced.” Another said that he was “the most complete egomaniac I have ever met.” third said he was “so utterly consumed with the trappings of power that he's destroying our effort to make this the Administration of the little man.” It is impossible to say whether those comments reflect the President's view. What is clear. is that Mr. Carter was determined to place command of his Administration in the hands of his long‐time aides and could not abide a Cabinet secretary with whom the aides could not get along. • The Department of Health, Education and Welfare is the Most unwieldy of Government agencies, behemoth that sprawls throughout Washington and its suburbs into every state and county in the country, spending more than one‐third of the Federal budget and employing about 150,000 people. No Secretary before was able to manage it: not Wilbur J. Cohen, the master bureaucrat; not Elliot L. Richardson, the politidal jack‐of‐all‐trades; not Caspar W. Weinberger, President Nixon's budget wizard. “What appealed to me most about the job,” Mr. Califano said, “was the idea that. no one could bring H.E.W. under control. By God, ‘I'm going show people that this place can be managed.” Whether he succeeded is a matter of conjecture. Looking back, his tenure seems to have been characterized” more by promise than by accomplishment. Enormous effort was spent drafting plans to revise the welfare system, control hospital costs, get a start on national health insurance and change the way drugs are screened and marketed, but the proposals went nowhere in Congress. On the other hand, in an Administration committed to balancing the budget, Mr. Califano went to the mat time and again to get more money for the poor, the aged and the handicapped. He challenged Mr. McIntyre at the Office of Management of Midget, cut deals with Mr. Eizenstat and went over their heads to the President. More often Wan not, he succeeded where a more timid official would have failed. • In many ways Patricia Roberts Harris is cut from the same cloth as Mr. Califano. She is a liberal lawyer (a former law partner of Sargent Shriver, the Kennedy in‐law) with long‐standing ties to Wasp ;ngton and the Democratic Party. She believes deeply the power of government to solve social problems. But there are important differences between the two that go far beyond sex, race and religion. Mr. Califano thrives on pressure and glory. He like the athlete who tries to win games single‐handed, controlling the ball until he can score the final goal. Mrs. Harris sees herself as a team player, content to leave the headlines to others. His has become a familiar face on the evening news. She walks through hotel lobbies unrecognized. He spoke out regularly at Cabinet meetings. She mostly listens. As Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Mrs. Harris maintained smooth relations with the varied special interests that she dealt with — the mayors and the civil rights groups, and the homebuilders and realtors. Mr. Califano managed to alienate most interest groups that were involved with H.E.W. programs — the doctors and the drug companies, educators and the handicapped. What is likely, then, is not so much a change of policy at H.E.W. as a change of style. Mrs. Harris set the tone, perhaps, Friday when she was asked what her position was on abortion. She gave a one sentence answer: “I have made a habit of not differing publicly with Administration decisions.” Before the inauguration, when Jimmy Carter was putting together his Cabinet, Robert S. Strauss, then and now one of his chief political advisers, told him: “If you pick Joe Califano, he'll irritate you every single day, but, at the end of the day, you'll look back and see that he's been a great asset.” From Mr. Carter's viewpoint today, he was apparently half‐right."
Plan for Women's Panel Stirs Ire,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/22/archives/long-island-weekly-plan-for-womens-panel-stirs-ire-plan-for-womens.html,"HAUPPAUGE WHEN Jane R. Devine, Suffolk County's only woman legislator, made her proposal for a Suffolk County Woman's Advisory Commission, she did not think the idea would stir up controversy. Now, some weeks later, several groups are accusing her of undermining family life, supporting homosexuality, promoting radical feminism and being a political opportunist. Mrs. Devine, a Huntington Democrat, suggested the creation of a 25member volunteer panel to “work for the elimination of inequalities affecting women in Suffolk.” She said the commission's purview would be limited to county issues and had no connection with the various accusations being made. Nonetheless, the proposal is being fiercely attacked by several organizations that describe themselves as “prolife” and “pro‐family.” They see the commission as synonymous with the proposed Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution, which they deplore. Mrs. Devine feels, however, that the greatest threat to her suggestion is the Conservative Party of Suffolk County, which has made the Issue a major conIsideration in its endorsement of politiсаl candidates. The executive committee of the Conservative Party decided unanimously to oppose Mrs. Devine's resolution because it said the state party platform was opposed to the. E.R. A. It asked Suffolk legislative candidates seeking Conservative endorsement to sign questionnaires stating whether they supported the proposed commission. There are 14,000 enrolled Conservatives in the county and, based on estimates from previous elections, it is estimated that the party could produce 30,000 votes in November's election. A Republican‐Conservative cross‐endorsement plan has been set up, and it is considered unlikely that Republican candidates will risk losing that endorsement by supporting the suggested commission. The Suffolk Conservative Party chairman, John Andrew Kay, asserts that the proposal is a vehicle for political advancement. “Mrs. Devine is a very nice woman and an astute politician,” Mr. Kay said. “She and others are using this idea as a steppingstone to election, and they're mad at me because I caught them at it.” In reply, Mrs. Devine said her proposal was a direct response to the needs of women in Suffolk County, adding: “Now, however, there are two issues here. First, there's the need for the commission, but the larger issue has become the subversion of the democratic process with these threats to withhold Conservative endorsement.” At the July 10 meeting of the Legislature, several speakers supported Mrs. Devine's argument. “This is an unconscionable act of political blackmail,” said Lee Moorhead, chairman of the woman's committee of the Civil Service Employees Association. She said her group supported the idea of the commission because most women in county jobs were consistently kept at the lowest Civil Service grade levels while men occupied the higher ones. Gloria Levin, chairman of the Suffolk Women's Political Caucus, added: “We want to make you aware of continuing discrimination against women. Remember that 50 percent of the voters in this county are women; your stature would be enhanced in their eyes if you approved of this measure.” However, an overwhelming majority of those speaking before the lawmakers at their last three sessions strongly opposed the commission. “Our type of woman doesn't want this,” said Phyllis Graham of Port Jefferson, the New York State chairman of Eagle Forum, a national organization that describes itself as “pro‐family.” “We are against a commission that will only support women's liberation and further the interests of the notorious National Organization for Women. We support women who stay at home and do their jobs.” Other speakers told the lawmakers they feared the commission would be infiltrated by what they called “radical groups” demanding easier access to abortion and supporting lesbianism. Rino Tulipano of Brentwood left most of the male legislators laughing when he said, “Women have had all the rights on earth. What more do they want?” He told them that accepting the idea of a woman's commission would be “tantamount to accepting emasculation.” “I was astounded,” Mrs. Devine said. “Mr. Tulipano was insulting womanhood, and my colleagues were giggling.” In an attempt to stem some of the criticism, Mrs. Devine revamped her proposal. A major change has been the exclusion of county financing, which she foresaw as “becoming a political issue.” Instead, the volunteer commission would seek any needed funds from private gifts and public grants, subject to legislative approval. The resolution still faces an uncertain future at best, however, and even its sponsors wonder if it will ever get out of committee. The experience has left Mrs. Devine perplexed. “The whole idea started as a cohesive one, not a divisive one,” she said. “What's incredible to me is to be accused of undermining family life — I'll be married 19 years in September, I've got three kids, a dog, and my motherin‐law lives with us.”"
The Painkiller Controversy,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/23/archives/the-painkiller-controversy.html,"WHEN Willis Reed of the New York Knicks was injected with 250 milligrams of an anesthetic called Carbocaine in order to play against the Los Angeles Lakers in the final game of the 1970 National Basketball Association playoffs, the shot was heard round the sports world. Reed, who had ruptured a muscle in his right thigh during the fifth game of the series, says that he remembers “going out on the floor and the crowd going wild — ‘He's here, it's all over, we're going to win.’ All I kept thinking was: ‘This is a hell of a situation to be in. I've got to play Wilt Chamberlain on one leg.” Reed played 28 minutes on the bad leg, but it was enough to insure the Knicks’ victory and establish his effort as an authentic profile in courage. Before the 1970's were over, Bill Wal ton, another dominant big man in the N.B.A., became a center of contro versy in regard to the use of injectable anesthetics when he too agreed to take painkilling injections in order to play in post‐season competition. Before a playoff game in April 1978, Dr. Robert Cook, the Portland Trail Blazers’ team physician, injected Wal ton's left foot with Xylocaine and Dees dron (an anti‐inflammatory drug) for what he described as “a chronic in flammatory condition.” Walton played 15 minutes of the first half before leaving the game in pain. X‐rays taken the next day revealed a broken bone in the foot, an injury that sidelined him for the entire 1978-79 sea son. Cook says that the break occurred during the game and was not related to the injection. “The area of the break was not anesthetized,” he says, “because if it had been, Walton would not have experienced the pain of the break.” Whatever the case, Walton eventu ally demanded to be traded, citing the Trail Blazers’ medical practices as the main reason. He later joined the San Diego Clippers. • If playing in pain takes courage, Wal ton says. that it also “takes a tremen dous amount of courage to convince yourself that you know better than the doctors.” “I've learned that when you're in jured, you try to play, but if you can't, you don't,” he adds. “And you don't let somebody convince you that numbing the area will make it better.” Taking injections of local anesthetics and anti‐inflammatory. drugs is no longer something to brag about in the N.B.A. And the subject is one that most peo ple in sports medicine would rather not talk about at all. Their reluctance to discuss the practice makes it difficult to assess how much of a factor the in jections really play in getting athletes back into action. George Veras, the assistant director of the Lenox Hill Institute of Sports Medicine in New York, says: “The Walton case has exacerbated the situa tion, People are gun‐shy. It's like the word ‘abortion.’ No matter how you use it, it's inflammatory. The N.B.A. Players Association gets upset, and the team physicians take it as an example of why they shouldn't talk to reporters about it at all.” Says Dr. James Garrick, who is writ ing a report on the subject for the American College of Sports Medicine: “Team physicians were scared before Walton. This has only scared them more. After all, there's not a lot of evi dence that it is a good idea to inject someone so he can go play basketball. Would you inject a housewife so that she Could do her housework? What makes it so different for an athlete?” Although Garrick, along with the ma jority of the players and the doctors in terviewed, believes that the practice is less prevalent than it used to be, he is skeptical of those who say flatly that it is not a problem. He comments: “When you go to the sports medicine meetings and ask the doctors, ‘Do you give injections?,’ the answer is, ‘We don't do it.’ Then you talk to the ath letes and they say. ‘Sure, I've been in jected.’ So who's doing it?” Veras theorizes that the problem may go beyond the locker‐room treat ment. “If you went to speak to 11 guys on the Knicks,” he says, “and they told you they got an average of 10 shots a year, and then you said to Dr. Nicholas, ‘The guys‐on the team said they got 110 shots,’ he'd go, ‘Well, I only gave out 10.’ These guys do go to other physi cians.” • The team physicians are in a difficult position. They say that not all injec tions are harmful. But the bad pub licity concerning the shots has made the doctors wary of discussing even those situations in which injections may be safe. Walton understands. “It is incorrect, in my opinion, to lump all injections to gether,” he says. “When you ask, ‘Would I ever take any injections again for the rest of my life,’ the answer is ‘Sure.’” There is a difference, explains Wal ton, between a therapeutic injection, after which a doctor tells you to go home and rest for two weeks, and an in jection “where they numb an area that allows you to play.” Anthony Saraniti, physical therapist at Lenox Hill, agrees. “Many orthope dists will give an athlete painkillers,” he says, “ and it's perfectly medically and legally fine, within the standard medical practices. But if I give you an injection and for some reason you fall over and break a bone or incur further damage, I can get sued.” That, according to Veras. is one of the reasons “that you never say or do anything about it.” Walton will not comment on a poten tial lawsuit against the Portland Trail Blazers or their physicians, except to say, “it has always been an issue” and “there are a lot‐of possibilities.” He is less reticent about discussing the medical care he received in Port- Sports Medicine: Healing the Athletes The second of four articles. land. According to Walton, the first time he was injected with an anesthetic was during a game in February 1976. He had experienced pain in his right leg during warmups but had decided to play anyway. “At halftime, Dr. Cook said if I just took this shot of Xylocaine in my leg, it would be all right to go back out and play,” recalls Walton. “I took the shot, felt good for about 35 sec onds, limped through the rest of the game and spent the next six weeks in a cast on crutches.” X‐rays taken after the game revealed a stress fracture of his right fibula. Despite this history, and his own mis givings, Walton again agreed to take painkilling injections in his left foot in the spring of 1978. “They injected me a total of at least four different times over two months,” he recalls. “Two of the times were on a Thursday and Friday. On Saturday, they ordered the X‐rays when I could no longer stand up.” Those X‐rays, taken with a special film, revealed a broken tarsal-naviclu lar bone below the left ankle that had not shown up in previous X‐rays. Since then, Walton has had a lot of time to consider not only why the injections were given, but also why he allowed them. ‘When all of a sudden you can't do it, and there's all your buddies wait ing for you, saying, ‘Let's go,’ and you've got to tell them you can't, that's a real tough thing to do,” he says. “I remember when I didn't take the•shots, all the things everybody said that I was a quitter and wasn't tough. The same thing happened when I did take the shots. The most important thing is that the athletes have to realize you're responsible for yourself. That's the bottom line.” Cook says he administered the injec tions with Walton's full knowledge and consent. “There's only an ethical prob lem if the athlete is deluded or not in formed,” says Cook. “But, it is a breach of ethics as much on the part of the athlete who enters into an informed consent and then, when something goes wrong, starts pointing fingers.” Dr. Ernest Vandeweghe, a Los An geles pediatrician who acted as Wal ton's agent when he was signed by the Clippers, says that what happened to his client was “shameful.” “I've had cases, for instance, of young men who have had their legs buckle underneath them while taking a, jump shot,” said the former New York Knick. “I examined the leg and there was absolutely nothing wrong with it. The natural reflex arc of the leg had prevented it from landing in an awk ward and damaging position. The body had taken care of itself.” “Send someone out there numbed and the body can't reflex naturally. Yet, athletes will still take any chances or anything to play because they want to “ • Even when giving an injection is a medically sound practice, Garrick says. sometimes there is a problem be. cause “players assume you'll give it to them for everything else.” ‘ “If you inject anybody for any thing,” he adds, “then you get 14 guys lined up saying,‘you shot him up, ‐wily can't you do it for me?’” Last summer, Billie Jean King went to her doctor and asked him for a shot of cortisone in her heel, so she could try for her 20th Wimbledon title. “When he shot me just before I left, he said, ‘You know this isn't good for you,“’ recalls Mrs. King, who re quested more shots in England. “I said, ‘I know, but I just want to get to Wim bledon.’” Cortisone is anti‐inflammatory drug, which acts as a painkiller only to the extent that it reduces swelling. Doctors now know, says Marshall, that “if you use cortisone repeatedly in a tendon or supporting structure, it can cause weakness. ” He adds: “I only use cortisone when it is given to a part that can't cause permanent damage.” Dr. James A. Nicholas, director of the Lenox Hill Institute of Sports Medi cine, agrees, saying: “In 1963, corti sone was still the best treatment for tendinitis. Today, I won't even use it for tennis elbow. The only place I'll use it is in a bicep.” Cortisone is usually injected rather than ingested in order to prevent gener alized side effects, which include stom ach ulcers. Dr. Frank Jobe, team physician for the Los Angeles Dodgers, mixes corti sone injections with a painkiller be cause “the cortisone injections them selves are rather painful.” “I use it for specific inflammatory conditions where there is an overuse syndrome,” he explains, “for example, if a pitcher has a sore arm from throw ing too hard, too long. But you can't use it with the idea that you're going to give it to him for a game that day. You have to wait at least two or three days.” Dr. Joseph S. Torg, team physician for the Philadelphia Flyers, says: “Un questionably, there are times when it is medically safe to use an injectable anesthetic. I would say that I'd be less than honest if I didn't admit to using them on rare occasions. They should not be used routinely but only in rare and exceptional cases.” Team physicians all agree that the use of injectable anesthetics, such as Novocain, Xylocaine, Marcaine and Carbocaine, is not routine. They say that stricter drug‐reporting codes, bet ter‐conditioned athletes and long‐term relationships between teams and doc tors all have contributed to the dimin ishing number of injections. What they cannot agree on are those rare and ex ceptional cases in which injections are permissible. Reflecting on the Reed situation, Parkes, who is now team physician for the New York Mets, says: “It would be a cold day in hell before I would want to make that decision again. I have always believed that you never inject a player to play on a day to‐day basis. “That was a situation where the game was for the world championship and the fact was that Willis really wanted to play. That kind of situation may come once a year — a World Series, a playoff. And still, I would think twice. Always.” “I did it once with Al Atkinson during the 1969 Super Bowl game,” said Nicho las, who is still team physician for the New York Jets. “He separated his shoulder in the third quarter and asked me for it. I took him inside and injected him with Xylocaine and he signed a re lease. I told him then, ‘It's separated and you may damage it more. I don't think you will, but you shouldn't really have this.’ “ Garrick says: “Sometimes bruised ribs, which are very painful, can be in jected, but only if there is no fracture.” • The only part of the body that most doctors agree am be safely injected is the toe. Charlie Waters of the Dallas Cow boys knows all about being injected for “turf toe.” “It's when you bend your toe back wards on the Astroturf,” the veteran defensive player says. “It's hard to run on and it's hard to push off. The shot doesn't really do anything except irri tate the joint and slow down the process of healing. You try not to get shots but you have to.” Last season, Waters says he was in jected — or “blocked” as he calls it only once for a sprained ankle. Physicians are generally opposed to “blocking an entire extremity,” says Jobe, explaining: “Suppose you had .a painful finger. You'd never give a shot in the wrist to make the hand numb so that you could perform.” Tom Landry, coach of the Dallas Cowboys, says: “If you can localize the area without there being a chance of having an injury that you didn't know about because the area was numb, then I don't see anything wrong with it. You don't want to shoot a knee, or an ankle. That's a joint that could be damaged severely.” Waters has given great thought to the practice of blocking pain. He says that in 1973, he “played a whole season with a broken arm and a rod in there holding the arm together.” “I used to get it blocked up in my shoulder because I had a pinched nerve in my neck and I couldn't lift the ball up without pinching the nerve. They'd block it so I could move around.” Dr. Marvin Knight, the Cowboys’ team physician, says, “Waters got some shots for a bursitis in his shoulder but he didn't get them every seventh day for eight weeks. The bursitis was the result of the shoulder being im mobilized and was secondary to the broken arm. “The rod was, put in so he wouldn't re‐break the arm,” Dr. Knight contin ues. “When a bone heals, it can have good union but still be weak. He would n't play until it was solid, though it might have been weaker than normal bone.” Still, Waters was careful how he tackled. “I made sure nobody hit me on the left arm,” he recalls. That was pos sible mostly because he was playing cornerback at the time and “mainly ran around and didn't get involved with any of the players.” Today, the 14‐inch surgical rod serves as a paperweight. Waters's arm feels fine, except for some numbness: which Dr. Knight says might be the re sult of some scar tissue. Looking back on it, Waters says, “I think I probably should have waited to play. But I was young and foolish. It was ridiculous. I might never have been able to use my left arm again.” The New York Times/Larry C. Morris Knicks’ Willis Reed ruptured a muscle in 1970 playoffs and needed Carbocaine injections to continue competing"
Behavioral Scientists Argue Guilt's Role,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/24/archives/behavioral-scientists-argue-guilts-role-behavioral-scientists-are.html,"ONE psychoanalyst, Dr. Theodore Isaac Rubin, calls “a destructive form of self‐hate.” Another, Dr. Willard Gaylin, characterizes it as “a guardian of our goodness.” Behavioral Scientists Argue Guilt's Role Both are talking about guilt. Their words underscore the contradictory nature of that emotion, which, with its potential to inspire or stifle, create or destroy, seems increasingly to interest —and divide— behavioral scientists. “The same emotion that is most constructive can bring into the worst trouble,” said Dr. Helen Block Lewis, an adjunct professor of psychology at Yale University. Recent research has confirmed some long‐suspected facts about guilt. For instance, people apparently try to avoid behaving in ways that make them feel guilty. Other studies have proved more surprising: One showed that guilt can even affect the amount of information a person retains from a lecture. As books and magazines with titles like “Stop Feeling Guilty” proliferate, some clinicians seem dedicated to the idea of erasing guilt from their patients’ psyches. Other clinicians, however, stress the distinction between guilt that is normal and that which is neurotic. Although they do not deny that some guilt is bad, they believe that certain kinds of behavior (including, perhaps, the attempt to abolish guilt) are worth feeling guilty about. “We're being sold this horrendous philosophy, this hedonistic garbage,” said Dr. Philip Bobrove, an associate professor of psychology at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. “It doesn't seem to matter as long as each one gets his. see us headed toward a real moral collapse.” Or as Dr. Allen Wheelis, a San Francisco psychoanalyst, puts it, “Reality‐oriented guilt is the socializing emotion. don't think we can have a civilization without it.” Despite the controversy over the usefulness of guilt, some things are agreed: that it has been around for a long time used to be called the sense of original sin); that it feels miserable (“I deserve to be punished”); that it can be attached just about anything. People may feel guilty about the most in- nocuous sexual behavior, about assertiveness, about surviving wars or plane crashes, about failure to realize their potential. Modern man, wrote Erich Fromm, “senses that his life runs through his fingers like sand” and “cannot help feeling guilty for the waste, for the lost chance.” Some psychotherapists have drawn broad conclusions about guilt from their work with patients. One of the most interesting observations is the assertion of Dr. Lewis that men are more prone to guilt than women. Women, she believes, are more likely to feel shame, that is, anxiety over failure. 2 Reasons for Sex Differences Dr. Lewis believes there are two reasons for the apparent sex difference. The first, she said, is that men are .expected to be more aggressive and thus have more opportunities for feeling guilty. Secondly, she said, the formation of gender identity is guilt‐provoking for boys. Little girls can develop a sense of being female just by identifying with the people who first care for them, their mothers. Boys, however, come to feel like boys only by in effect renouncing their mothers. The main researcher on guilt is Donald L. Mosher, a University of Connecticut psychologist who developed the so- called Mosher guilt scales. These are paper-and-pencil tests designed to measure guilt as a personality trait, the tendency to feel guilty. He has found three distinct traits that he calls sex‐guilt, hostility‐guilt and morality‐conscience, which is the most general type of guilt. One test item is sufficient to show how sex‐guilt is measured. Given the clause, “If I committed adultery,” the test‐taker must choose between two conclusions: “I hope I would be punished very deeply” or “I hope I enjoy it.” Selecting the latter suggests low sex‐guilt. Administering the Mosher tests to reformatory inmates, researchers found that people who admitted to sex crimes generally scored low on sex‐guilt. Inmates who had committed violent crimes were likely to score low in hostility‐guilt, while those who had committed property crimes usually had low scores on the morality‐conscience scale. The inference is that conscience really does tend to restrain behavior. As use of the Mosher scales increases, findings seem to become more provocative. One study showed that subjects high in sex‐guilt retained less birth control information from a lecture. Another demonstrated that abortion patients scored higher on sex‐guilt than did single women who were sexually active but not pregnant. In psychotherapy, patients agonize not only over old‐fashioned sex‐guilt but also over a more contemporary kind of guilt. Dr. Matti Gershenfeld, Philadelphia psychologist, is one of many therapists reporting that wives still feel guilty for wanting careers and husbands for not helping at home. Dr. Gershenfeld has just received two‐yetir grant from the Rockefeller Family Fund and the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation for research aimed at finding ways to reduce unwarranted guilt in both men and women. Another therapist particularly concerned about lacerating self‐reproach is Dr. Celia Hales, a Phoenix City, Ariz., psychologist. Many women, she says, are convinced that it must be their fault if people around them are unhappy. Such women also feel guilty for “doing what they should do,” for instance, nudging an overly dependent family member toward independence, or refusing to lie for an alcoholic. Distorted Memories Cited Dr. George R. Bach, a psychologist who practices in Los Angeles, believes that guilt is often based on distorted memories. To correct them, he uses technique of “revisiting.” One of Dr. Bach's patients, he said, felt guilty over what he thought of as his exploitation of women. He traced the feeling to a day in his childhood when, he remembered, he had cruelly pushed his frightened little sister toward a bear at a circus. Prodded to revisit the occasion in memory with his sister, he gave her his version of the events, and was astonished and relieved to find that hers was quite different; in fact, she told him, he had always treated her with kindness. Not all patients are eager to be relieved of self‐reproach. “The neurotic person,” said the late Karen Homey, “insists on his guilt and vigorously resists every attempt to exonerate him.” Among the best known of those psychiqtrists who do not see guilt as all bad is Dr. Karl Menninger. One aim of psychoanalytic treatment, he once wrote, is “to get people's guilt feelings attached to the ‘right’ things.” Like Dr. Menninger, Dr. Bobrove, the Philadelphia psychologist, believes in the value of rational guilt. He is outraged by the many people who, he says, appear to be entirely without guilt, without concern for others, without remorse for pain inflicted. Freud, too, lamented the dearth of appropriate guilt. “As regards conscience,” he told his students, “God has done an uneven and careless piece of work, for a large majority of men have brought along with them only a modest amount of it, or scarcely enough to be worth mentioning.” Guilt, he believed, is the necessary price of civilization. In his view, aggressive impulses that cannot be expressed against others if civilization is to survive inevitably turn inward against the self. The resulting sense of guilt, Freud thought, usually goes underground, emerging in consciousness as anxiety, a sense of worthlessness, fear of impending disaster, or simply a general feeling of discontent. Agreeing with Freud on the link between guilt and civilization, behavioral scientists used to believe — and they had studies to “prove” it — that guilt was practically nonexistent outside the West. Now there are newer studies suggesting that guilt is probably experienced in most if not all cultures. Milton B. Singer, an anthropologist at the University of Chicago, has even raised the possibility that “primitive man has a greater burden of guilt than civilized man.” If so‐there is no proof — it comes from the fact that “drought, disease, bad crops, poor hunting, defeat in war all have moral signifcance because they are seen as punishment for misbehavior.” Thus everyone has reason for self‐accusation when things go wrong in the life of the community. So there is no point in envying the presumably guilt‐free existence of “simpler” peoples. In the words of the late American anthropologist Robert Redfield, “To primitive man the universe is spun of duty and ethical judgment.”"
The Region,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/24/archives/the-region-thousands-of-fish-killed-upstate.html,"SYRACUSE — Thousands of dead fish were found in Onondaga Creek yesterday following a break in an Allied Chemical Corporation pipeline about seven miles south of here spilled tons of salt water into the fresh‐water stream. The rupture was repaired late Sunday afternoon. The break, which dumped about 100 gallons of salt water a minute into the creek for at least day and a half, was discovered in a 50year‐old section of pipe six feet underground. Allied pumps a 10-to-12-percent solution of brine from its salt wells in Tully, about 20 miles south of here, to its Syracuse works. About 4,100 net tons of salt brine are used daily in the company's production of chlorine and of soda ash, a primary’ ingredient in hundreds of products, including glass. Allied faces possible fines of up to $10,000 a day for the spill, depending on the extent of the fish kill and the de- partment's ruling concerning responsibility for the spill, according to state officials. L.I. Market Rebuffed On Coupon Plea MINEOLA, L. I. — A Long Island supermarket concern that pleaded guilty to fraud in a scheme involving the redemption of more than $100,000 in manufacturers’ discount coupons was rebuffed in attempt to recover the 11 bags of coupons held by the Nassau County District Attorney's office. In ruling that Melmarkets (Big Mel of East Rockaway) was not entitled to recover the coupons that had been seized and used as evidence, Jutice Alfred Semenga said the concern was “attempting to have the best of all possible worlds.” Noting that it had long been the policy of the state “that a wrongdoer not benefit from his crime,” Justice Semenga said that if Melmarkets was able “to recover the instruments of that fraud” the $10,000 fine it paid on its guilty plea “becomes merely a ‘cost of doing business,’ recoupable from the intended victim.” Ban on Abortions Extended by Judge HARTFORD (AP) — Judge M. Joseph Blumenfeld of Federal District Court has continued until Aug. 13 a temporary restraining order against Connecticut's ban on paying for most abortions for women on welfare. Judge Blumenfeld had issued the temporary restraining order last week. Since August 1977, Connecticut has paid for abortions for women on welfare only when the life’ of the woman was in danger. Before the imposition of that restriction, the state paid for about 1,750 abortions annually. That figure has now dropped to about 250 abortions a year. The Federal Court suit was initiated by the newly formed Rosie Jimenez Memorial Alliance of New Haven and brought by two Connecticut Civil Liberties Union lawyers, Martha Stone and Catherine Roraback. The alliance, made up of 25 women's organizations, memorializes the first American woman said to have died of an illegal abortion. The suit charges state policy is arbitrary and discriminates against the poor. Some Clam Beds On Sound to Reopen STONY BROOK, L.I. (AP) — The Department of Environmental Conservation said it planned to lift a 10‐year ban on clamming in 6,400 acres of Long Island Sound clam beds by the end of July. A department biologist, James Redman, said “the water quality has improved” in the beds .from Oak Neck Point in Bayville to Matinicock Point in Glen Cove since the state began closing many areas in the late 1960's because of poor water quality. He attributed the improved quality to “better functioning of New York City sewage treatment plants,” particularly the addition of chlorine before the sewage is released into the East River. Another area — 2,500 acres from Glen Cove to the eastern edge of Hempstead Harbor — is still being 3ested by the conservation department. The area being freed from the ban represents 8 percent of the total 120,000 acres now off limits to clammers. Mr. Redman said the department would “do some more sampling to try and determine the worst pollution condition” in the Hempstead harbor area before a decision was made. Clamming is an $80 million-a-year industry on Long Island."
California Inquiry: Who Is to Judge Judges?; News Analysis,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/27/archives/california-inquiry-who-is-to-judge-judges-news-analysis.html,"Several months ago, in a magazine article, Rose Elizabeth Bird, the Chief Justice of California's Supreme Court, spoke of why “judges must end their insularity.” She concluded the article, which appeared in The Judges’ Journal, a publicaLion of the American Bar Association, with a quotation from a 1949 speech by Associate Justice William 0. Douglas of the Supreme Court. “A judiciary that discloses what it is doing and why it does it will breed understanding,” said Justice Douglas. “And confidence based on understanding is more enduring than confidence based on awe.” For more than a month, the inner workings of Justice Bird's court — including the fears, suspicions, hostilities and jealousies of the seven justices — have been exposed in televised public hearings. In the latest twist in the inquiry, the seven justices, who are the target of the inquiry, have been asked to determine if the proceedings should be open. Situation Held Bizarre That bizarre situation raises anew the question of who judges the judges. The narrow focus of the current inquiry by California's Commission on Judicial Performance has been to determine if the court's decision in a controversial gun law case was delayed for political reasons, and if any justice gave information about the case to the press. But the proceedings have become more than that. One Justice, Stanley Mosk, called the open proceedings a “circus” and refused to testify OR the ground that they were unconstitutional. His contention was sustained by an appellate court. While the California Supreme Court ponders whether to keep the hearings closed, the commission has begun conducting private sessions. The California inquiry comes at a juncture when pressures on judges to be accountable to the public have intensified, A Matter of Degree In the last couple of decades, the judicary has become a much more visible branch of government, as judges have ruled on such emotional and complicated social issues as affirmative action programs, busing, public school prayers, abortions and prison conditions. Courts have taken on characteristics of regulatory agencies and quasi legislatures. “Both the pettiest details and the broadest concepts of government have come within the judicial ambit,” said Irving R. Kaufman, chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in a lecture on judicial independence that he delivered last fall at the New York City Bar Association. Here are degrees of independence among judges. Ordinarily, state trial judges, many of whom are elected, are less independent than Federal judges, who are appointed for life. Trial judges differ from appellate judges. Short of impeachment, it is nearly impossible to remove a Federal judge, even if he is senile, an incorrigible alcoholic or rude and abusive. Not long ago, a law professor who represented a private client was so incensed over the conduct of the Federal trial judge handling the case that he planned to lodge a formal complaint. Only then did he discover that there was no appropriate body to file a complaint with. Legislation before Congress would create such machinery, but such proposals have been strenuously resisted by most judges. “The judge must be assured unequivocally that his decisions, no matter how unpopular, will not threaten his term of office, and that the only indignity he may suffer for error is reversal,” said Judge Kaufman, who was speaking specifically of Federal judges. “We must abide some judges without whom the system would be better off,” he went on, “because the dangers are greater on the side of an overly potent removal power. To allow judicial removal for vague grounds of dissatisfaction is to create a dragnet which will inevitably sweep into its grasp the maverick, the dissenter, the innovator, the reformer in a word, the unpopular.” Yet review of trial judges’ work by appellate courts has its limitations as a method of curbing judicial misbehavior. A major failing with this approach, according to several appeals lawyers, is that it is often years before an appellate bench hears the appeal. In the meantime, the trial judge could either have mended his ways or become even more reckless. In state courts, formal disciplining of trial judges is more common than at the Federal level, but most often the judges who are disciplined are in the lower courts or serving part time. Nearly every state has some sort of judicial discipline panel, but a review of the sketchy statistics that are available suggest that the performance of such panels is uneven. Decisions Made Collectively In theory, trial judges are held in check by appellate review, but what if the perverse or inadequate judge is on an appellate court? Legal historians point out that appellate decisions are made collectively to guard against this event. No opinion can become law without the concurrence of at least half of the author's colleagues. What separates the situation on the California Supreme Court — once considered the premier state court in the country — from past disciplinary problems is that more than one judge is being scrutinized. For the first time, an entire court is on trial."
Abortion Looms as Issue In Suffolk Executive Race,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/29/archives/long-island-weekly-abortion-looms-as-issue-in-suffolk-executive.html,"ABORTION— a subject that cuts across religious, economic, social and political lines — appears to be shaping up as pivotal issue in this fall's race for Suffolk County Executive. In the last several years, no subject, not taxes or the Southwest Sewer District, has produced a more heated, emotional response in public debate in the Suffolk County Legislature. The controversy over abortion whether it should be permitted and whether governmental funds should help pay for it — led to the creation on the Island of the statewide Right to Life Party, whose endorsement of a candidate in the Nov. 7 election for County Executive could produce a split among the majority of Republican and Conservative voters in favor of the Democratic candidate. Among those being “screened” for endorsement by the new party is Peter Fox Cohalan, the Supervisor of the Town of Islip, who is opposing John V. N. Klein, the incumbent Executive, in the Sept. 11 Republican primary. The Right to Life Party says it is also considering the possible endorsement of Walter Mathews, the treasurer of the Suffolk Conservative Party, who has threatened to wage a primary challenge against the Conservative Party leadership's endorsement of Mr. Klein for re‐election. “In any event, we won't consider endorsing Mr. Klein because of his past record, which was clearly pro‐abortion,” said Dr. Donald Doyle, an official of the Right to Life Party. “We go on a candidate's record, not his promises,” he said. Dr. Doyle said his party had invited Dr. Martint J. Feldman, the Democratic Party's designee for Executive, “to fill out a questionnaire and be screened,” but that a response had not yet been received by the party. Dr. Doyle said that both Mr. Cohalan and Mr. Mathews had submitted their responses to Right to Life questionnaires in recent past elections. “They were judged by our people,” he said, “to be pro‐life.” “Whatever the outcome of the primaries,” Dr. Doyle said, “we'll be in the enviable position with a fourth party line on the November ballot to either support a candidate or name our own.” Mr. Klein, nevertheless, has not crossed himself off among Right to Life voters. He says he sees abortion reform not only as one of the key issues of his campaign, but also for the nation as whole in the next decade. “The quality of life will be one of the major issues as we approach the 1980's,” Mr. Klein said, “and clearly two of those are nuclear power and the right to life.” Mr. Klein said he was fully in support of an amendment to the state law that would in effect discontinue funds for abortions under the state's Medicaid program except in extreme cases. A year ago, the Suffolk County Legislature approved a bill barring the use of state funds for abortions in Suffolk. Mr. Klein had vetoed the bill, but was overridden by the Legislature by a vote of 14 to 3. Nevertheless, Mr. Klein, on advice from County Attorney Howard Pachman, ignored the Legislature and ordered the county to continue to spend state funds as had been designated by Albany. The Right to Life Party sued to force Mr. Klein to heed the override. Mr. Klein was upheld by the courts, but the matter still is pending on appeal. Among the three who voted against override was Dr. Feldman, a dentist and legislator who is now seeking Mr. Klein's job as the Democratic candidate. “Personally I do not believe in abortion,” Dr. Feldman said, “but I also believe that the government should not regulate in this area.” As for the use of Medicaid funds for abortions, Dr. Feldman insisted that this was not an abortion issue, but matter of whether the state was going to discriminate against the poor and those less privileged. Dr. Feldman noted that the Supreme Court of the United States had ruled that the states had the option to determine whether they will supply filds for abortions. Since New York State has chosen to do so, he said it was up to Suffolk County to carry put state law. Dr. Feldman charged that Mr. Klein had “changed his mind about the abortion issue” because “he's looking for Right to Life support.” “In any event, I don't think abortion reform is going to be an issue in the upcoming campaign,” Dr. Feldman said. “If anything, the issue is taxes. Whatever it is, anything that forces the Republican organization to clean house is to my benefit and everyone else's.” Repeated efforts to reach Mr. Cohalan last week for his views on the abortion issue were unsuccessful. The Right to Life Party moved from Line K to Line Don the ballot statewide when it polled 130,000 votes in last year's gubernatorial election. More than 14,000 of those votes came from Suffolk County alone, which would be enough to swing any countywide election, especially if it is more than a twoway race.■"
Trial Lawyers Gathering To Learn Winning Ways,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/31/archives/trial-lawyers-gathering-to-learn-winning-ways-wellfinanced-lobby.html,"HOUSTON, July 30 — The trial lawyers who are holding their annual convention here are entrepreneurs, the gamblers of the legal profession, taking fees from 15 to 40 percent of the award if they win a case and nothing if they lose. The very best or them — tnose invorvea in disasters like the DC‐10 crash in Chicago last May 25 — can earn several hundred thousand dollars a year. Others barely scrape by, and they came to this meeting to learn winning techniques from the experts. The 1,000 lawyers who are meeting here belong to the Association of trial Lawyers of America, a group that has become a growing factor in the legal profession. In the words of the organization's president, Michael F. Colley, a 42‐yearold lawyer from Columbus, Ohio, their clients are “the injured, the maimed, the killed.” Lawyers who work for insurance companies or corporations are allowed in this bar association, but they are not given the right to vote, and few of them are members. Over the last decade, the trial lawyers’ organization has nearly doubled in size, to 90,000 members, which makes it one of the nation's largest bar associations. It is still dwarfed by the American Bar Association, which includes more than half the nation's 500,000 lawyers among its members, and it lacks the prestige of the American College of Trial Lawyers, whose membership is restricted to 1 percent of the nation's lawyers. But, with its enthusiastic membership and well‐financed lobbying efforts in Washington and in state capitals, the trial lawyers’ group pursues its goals with tenacity. The organization believes in the right to trial by jury and fiercely opposes what it believes are encroachments on that right. Mr. Colley and other officers of the organization also view themselves as engaging in almost a holy war with the casualty insurance industry, which is seeking to curb the size of damage awards in injury cases. The single‐mindedness of the group is reflected in many ways at this convention. For example, Federal District Judge Charles R. Richey of the District of Columbia was given an award today for his “dedication to the preservation of the adversary system of justice.” Another award went to Judge Irving R. Norman of the Cook County, Ill.; Circuit Court “for his belief in a lawyer's right to full and complete” examination of prospective jurors. The lawyers came here to socialize, stir up some business from one another other and to learn. They have been told of new areas of legal practice. One program during the seven‐day convention is devoted to malpractice among professionals. Not only can doctors and lawyers be sued, but also architects, accountants, investment counselors, pharmacists, highway designers and dentists. “Case selection is important” in dental malpractice suits, advised Dr. Edwin Zinman, who is both a dentist and a physician. “Not withstanding the relatively small size of the average dental claim, occasional dental negligence cases have been settled in excess of $1 million.” At a session yesterday in which experienced lawyers shared novel ideas with their colleagues, Richard T. Tomar of Washington told of a growing area of the law involving “wrongful births.” Those cases deal with negligent sterilization procedures, unsuccessful abortions, negligent performance of genetic testing and failure to instruct properly in the use of contraceptives. In wrongful‐birth cases, parents seek damages for the cost of raising the child. Judges and jurors are beginning to award damages in such cases, but so far resistance to these cases remains strong. One of the most popular speakers was Melvin M. Belli, the San Francisco trial lawyer who has been nicknamed the “king of torts.” “There is nothing more important than having some visual evidence for the jury to see,” he said. “Cases have to be presented on a grand scale. You have got to show demonstrative evidence if you are going to get the big awards.” He recommended that lawyers introduce into evidence a movie depicting a day in the life of their injured client. He told of a recent case in which his client had lost both his hands. The movie showed his client struggling to get out of bed, wash himself and eat. The client had been an amateur saxophone player before he was injured, and Mr. Belli played in court a tape recording of his client playing the saxophone. The lawyer then placed the saxophone on a table for the jurors to see. That impressed them, the veteran trial lawyer said. “You could hear the angels sing and the cash registers ring.”"

Califano Busy Up to the End,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/08/04/archives/califano-busy-up-to-the-end-mrs-harris-takes-over-statement-to.html,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 3 — Joseph A.

Spada to The New Yorialmes Meanwhile, his successor, Patricia Roberts Harris, the former Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, was being sworn into her new office by Justice Tburgood Marshall of the Supreme Court in the East Room of the White House, with President Carter and a crowd of well‐wishers looking on. Mr. Califano was not invited to the ceremony. In the statement on Darion, Mr. Califon Said that the warning label• for the drug, for which the Eli Lilly Company won approval from the Food and Drug Adthinistration on Monday, did not provide sufficiently strong warnings that Darvon was dangerous and should be avoided. Statement to Vance The Federal agency approved the new labeling after Mr. Califano was dismissed by President Carter. Mr. Califano also released a statement to Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance saying that the United States should not subsidize the Mexican Government's use of the herbicide Paraquat for spraying. marijuana fields. He said in his statement that the United States had the legal authority to withhold subsidies because the substance could be consumed by people who were unaware of the contamination by Paraquat. After swearing in Richard Lowe as deputy inspector general for health, Mr. Califano presented to one smoker, Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Harlem, a copy pf the Surgeon General's report on the hazards ‘of smoking. Mr. Califano, a former smoker and ardent opponent of smoking, had inscribed it: “For Charlie Rangel, who has too much fire in his heart and soul to smoke cigarettes.” His Plans Not Known By early afternoon Mr. Califano had left his office and Mrs. Harris had arrived to take over as the new Secretary. Mr. Califano, who was not available for comment, has not given any indication of what he plans to do, according to a department spokesman. Mr. Califano was the first Cabinet officer to be ousted by President Carter in his July 18 reorganization. He was known on Capitol Hill for his ability to operate. smoothly with members of Congress. He was also known for his independence, and he drew sharp criticism from North Carolina tobacco farmers for his antismoking campaign. He also drew fire for his department's 'strong enforcement of school desegregation and for his view that Federal money should not be used to finance abortions under the Medicaid program. His style also appeared to rankle some members of Mr. Carter's staff. Mr. Califano, some White House staff members said, was not a team player. The New York Times /D.

Congress Delays Action on Education Department,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/08/05/archives/congress-delays-action-on-education-department-senate-bill-not.html,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 4 — The nation's schools will be well into another academic year before Congress decides whether to create a new Cabinet‐level department of education. Senate‐House conferees on the bill made that clear this week when they met but deferred runner action until Sept. H, the week after Congress returns from a month's vacation. Faced with what Carter Administration sources concede are “very difficult decisions,” The conferees are not likely to reach any agreement until late September, and it would be early October before their compromise reached the Senate and House floors. The “difficult decisions” all involve House‐approved amendments to ban the busing of students to achieve racial desegregation, to encourage prayers in public schools, to prohibit racial or sexual quotas for admission to colleges, and to restrict the new department's involvement with abortions, either directly or indirectly. Senate Bill Not Restrictive None of these provisions were in the bill when it cleared the Senate last April by a vote of 72 to 21. That bill merely created a 13th Cabinet department embracing the present Office of Education, now housed in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, and various .education programs now administered by other Federal departments and agencies. But the Houses by margins of up to 2 to 1, approved what backers of the new department consider extremely crippling amendments befoi‐e passing the biii by a vote of 210 to 206 on July 11. The makeup of the Senate‐House conference committee would seem to indicate that all or most of the amendments will be dropped. All five of the Senate conferees voted for the bill without any such amendments. They are Senators Abraham Ribicoff of Connecticut, John Glenn of Ohio and Carl Levin of Michigan, all Democrats, and Jacob K. Javits of New York and Charles K. Percy Jr. of Illinois, Republicans. Votes of House Conferees Of the nine House conferees, only two, John N. Erlenborn of Illinois and Arlan Stangeland of Minnesota, both Republicans, voted for the amendments and against the bill. Only one other House conferee, William S. Moorhead, Democast of Pe.rinsyivania, voted against final passage. However, he dlso voted against the amendments. Vbting against the amendments and for the bill were Jack Brooks of Texas, Dante B. Fascell of Florida, Elliot H. Levitas of Georgia, Fernand J. St Germain of Rhode Island and Don Fuqua of Florida, all Democrats, ,and Frank Horton of upstate New York, Republican. However, the conferees will be faced with this question: Would the House accept a compromise stripped of provisions that had earlier been approved by such widemargins? Public Lacks Interest A further complicating factor is a general lack of public interest in whether the department is set up or not. Professional educators are split on the question, with the National Education Association favoring the new department and the American Federation of Teachers opposing it. Members of Congress are not likely to get any guidance from most of their constituents on the matter. “It just doesn't hit home,” said an aide to Senator Ribicoff. “To most people, it isn't a crisis, it's not an emotional issue. It's not the crisis you feel when you line up at the gas pumps.”"
MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY: THE NEW REVOLUTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/08/05/archives/medical-technology-the-new-revolution-121000346.html,"If you have to go to the hospital 10 years from now, your visit may run something like this: Fast the inevitable receptionist, your street clothes exchanged for a shapeless hospital gown, you enter a small, antiseptic room. You take a seat and offer your arm to a rectangular machine. Painlessly the machine draws a blood sample and within seconds has analyzed it down to its smallest mean- ingful platelet. The information is flashed to a central computer deep within the hospital, where it is compared with previous readings to detect an infection anywhere in your body. You move to an adjoining room and sit under a massive apparatus. Silently, your body is probed by X-rays or microwaves, while sensors inspect the surface of your skin. A thermogram will show areas of raised temperature, which can reveal incipient disease. Although you feel nothing, see nothing, the inner workings of your body are being deeply scrutinized. A developing gallstone, still barely larger than a grain of sand, is noted and appraised; like a tiny white clot lodged within a coronary artery or a polyp hidden in your nasal cavity, it may be harmless, but nevertheless deserves watching.

Near right, Drs. Daniel C. Baker (left) and William W. Shaw (right) visit their patient Renee Katz at Bellevue Hospital after having reattached her right hand, which was severed by a subway train. Far right, special miniature tools have been developed that permit surgeons to make barely visible sutures in arteries and veins. diagnoses and suggested methods of treatment. □ Medicine today is in the midst of a technological revolution, a transformation that is already changing the art of healing. New instruments and machines can already glimpse a 3-monthold fetus curled within its mother's womb, painlessly diagnose brain damage, help surgeons fuse damaged nerves and blood vessels. And still other seemingly miraculous inventions are almost at hand. At Rockefeller University and New York Hospital, an experimental “artificial pancreas” can instantaneously measure glucose levels and adjust the amount of insulin fed into the bloodstreams of selected diabetic patients, preventing wild daily fluctuations in glucose levels. Experiments with sophisticated electronics at the University of Utah and New York's Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center have meant sight for the blind and hearing for the deaf. At the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, various medical teams are refining a complicated technique used in chemistry called nuclear magnetic resonance to track the chemistry of living cells. In the not very distant future they hope to be able to detect changes in heart muscle cells before a heart attack occurs and then quickly arrest them; they should also be able to detect early rejection of transplanted organs and take preventive action. But along with this dramatic new technology and its apparent potential for solving many of our most perplexing medical problems, controversy has developed about its benefits and costs. Critics contend that the increasing use of machines is dehumanizing the practice of medicine and creating intolerable medical expenses as well as hidden medical dangers. This past November, at the behest of top Congressional leaders, a National Center for HealthCare Technology was established in Washington to take a closer look at the new technology. “Medical instrumentation has reached the point and expense where it must be closely scrutinized,” says Dr. Seymour Perry, the acting director of the new center. “We know there have been truly important advances. Now we have to decide which of them are appropriate and which are not.” The Korean and Vietnam Wars both played a part in creating the new technology. Experimental physicists and mathematicians first employed to develop deadly new electronic gadgets for warfare (such as improved radar to track enemy missiles or infrared sensors to spot troop movements through nighttime jungles) began to look around for other areas in which to practice their skills. Advanced computers arrived on the scene in the early 1960's. By the early 1970's, the amalgamation of medicine and physics began to be known as bioengineering and departments of bioengineering cropped up in medical schools around the country. In a small pastel room at New York Hospital, a 36-year-old woman, six months pregnant with her first child, lies on an examining table. While music plays in the background, a young technician swabs her belly with a thick gel, then holds a beige wandlike probe, not much longer than a toothbrush, directly over it. Nearby, an image of the fetus in the mother's womb suddenly swims into view on the screen of what looks like a small portable television set. Though murky, the image is clear enough to show the baby curled within the womb, and, at the center, a smudge of pulsing gray, its rapidly beating heart. “Is that my baby?” the woman excitedly asks, craning her neck for a better look at the screen. “That's your baby's chest, and there's a foot,” answers a radiologist standing next to the screen, snapping a lever that will record the view in still photos to be examined later. “He's lying with his head down.” “Is everything normal?” “Everything looks fine.” Ei Ultrasound is one of the most promising developments in the new field of bioengineering. Conventional X‐rays reveal little about the organs deep within our anatomy; for example, until recently the only way to obtain truly accurate information about the heart was to insert a snakelike catheter through a vein in the arm and gradually work it into the chambers of the heart, a risky and sometimes even fatal procedure. But now with ultrasound a picture can be obtained of the organs of the body at work. Ultrasound, using the same principle developed years ago to locate enemy submarines, employs ultrasonic waves. Sonar signals too high for humans to hear are bounced off the organs of the body and received by a tiny instrument that translates them into pictures. In patients with gallbladder disease —a leading cause of surgery in adults — ultrasound has now been refined to the point where it can detect gallstones. It is also beginning to be employed to examine the prostate gland, malfunctions of which affect nearly half of all men over 50. “Nowadays, instead of going through time‐consuming and uncomfortable tests, the patient goes straight to ultrasound,” says Dr. Joseph P. Whalen, radiologist in chief at New York Hospital and professor of radiology at Cornell University Medical College. “It's a whole new dimension in diagnosis.” But probably the most widespread use of ultrasound has been in obstetrics, where it is now employed to monitor almost half of all pregnancies and deliveries. “In the first three months we can use ultrasound to determine if indeed the woman is pregnant,” says Dr. Heidi Weissmann, a radiologist and ultrasound specialist at Montefiore Hospital and Medical Center. “Calculations and chemical tests are by no means always reliable.” The probe can detect if the fetus is developing outside the womb, for example— a serious hazard to the mother's health. Ultrasound has also made amniocentesis much safer. This procedure involves the insertion of a hollow needle into the amniotic cavity and the removal of some amniotic fluid. This contains cells sloughed off by the growing baby, cells that can be used to determine if it has certain genetic abnormalities. (In the case of a deformed or Mongoloid fetus, the mother might elect to have an abortion.) “A few years ago, before ultrasound, we used to have to stick the needle in without knowing exactly where,” says Weissmann. “There was always the chance of jabbing it into some vital area. Now you can see where the head, heart, umbilical cord are.” □ The woman in her early 60's is rushed to Yale‐New Haven Hospital, showing all the symptoms of a massive stroke. Her eyes are glazed, her speech slurred; she is unable to lift her right hand. On an impulse, the emergencyroom doctor calls the hospital's radiology department. The woman is quickly wheeled to a well‐lighted room dominated by a large, arching apparatus. She is placed on a special couch or “gantry” and slowly moved by conveyor belt into what looks like the hatch of a space capsule. A thin beam of X‐rays makes a lateral sweep of her head, collecting more than 10,000 readings; it then rotates 10 degrees for another sweep. As the angle changes, a completely new set of data is collected and stored. Across the way, in a darkened control room, a radiologist peers at the screen of a computer console, which provides a detailed outline of the woman's brain. The results of the scan indicate a dark gray circle on one of her pulsing cerebral lobes; the woman has not had a stroke, she has a brain tumor. In a matter of hours the woman has surgery for what turns out to be a benign tumor. In a few weeks she is released from the hospital. The Computerized Axial Tomography (CAT) scanner is an imaging device closely allied to ultrasound. In fact, at some places the two have been combined in a single treatment unit. New York Hospital, for example, created the Department of Body Imaging for the machines. But unlike ultrasound, the CAT scanner uses a battery of X‐rays to take a cross‐sectional picture — a tomogram — of the patient's body. Then computers put the millions of bits of information together in a clear picture on a computer screen. “I think most physicians would agree that it's one of the most revolutionary advances in almost 70 years,” says Dr. Whalen. In many cases, the CAT scanner has already replaced other forms of diagnosis. Instead of having to inject air into the brain — a sometimes excruciating procedure called pneumoencephalography — doctors can now obtain an even clearer view of a suspected brain tumor with a CAT scanner. “Another example is cancer of the pancreas,” says Dr. Whalen. “This is extremely difficult to diagnose without surgery. In the olden days — that is, five years ago — you might have had to put a catheter into the arteries of the pancreas and inject it with constrasting solution. Now the patient can come in to one of our three scanners, spend possibly half an hour, and the only discomfort involved is having to hold his breath for a few seconds. Sometimes we've found inoperable cancer, but even then we've saved the patient needless additional suffering and expense.” □ But diagnosis is only one area in which the new medical technology has had a striking impact. Important gains have also been made in treatment. For 32-year-old fireman James Spink, a pleasant afternoon has become a nightmare. While doing some carpentry work at home, his electric saw slipped from his grasp, slashing his left hand and severing his thumb. He is rushed to Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx, where his bleeding is stopped, but his thumb cannot be saved. Since Spink is left‐handed, the loss of his thumb could mean the end of his 11‐year career as a firefighter. But plastic surgeons at Montefiore have a different idea. With Spink's eager permission, they use microsurgery — surgery conducted with the aid of high‐powered microscopes — to remove the fireman's big toe, along with its attached blood vessels, nerves and tendons, and transfer it to his hand to replace the missing thumb. With sutures almost invisible to the naked eye, blood vessels must be sewn together, nerves reattached so that the toe-become‐thumb will have enough sensation to function. Fourteen months later, James Spink returns to his job as hook-and-ladder man on Engine 46 with Ladder Company 27 in the Bronx, having passed the Fire Department's rigorous physical examinations. The remaining stump of his big toe gives him enough stability to walk, and his new thumb, while it looks a little shorter and stubbier than the original, works almost as well. “I didn't think I'd ever be able to work as a fireman again,” says Spink. “Going back to work was the happiest moment of my life.” □ “Microsurgery is probably the most important thing to come along in surgery in decades,” says Dr. Laurence LeWinn, assistant professor of surgery at New York Hospital‐Cornell Medical Center. “It has opened up new vistas on just about everything.” The basic tools for this advance are microscopes capable of magnifying nerves and blood vessels up to 40 times. Usually operated by zoom pedals to make clumsy manipulation unnecessary, they are often connected to television screens so that other members of the operating team can see what the surgeon is doing. Almost as important are the instruments — from scissors with tiny blades to miniature forceps. Surgical thread is so thin that it is practically invisible to the naked eye. Used together, these have allowed spe- cially trained surgeons to accomplish feats impossible a few years ago. Within the past year, microsurgical cases have regularly made headlines. One that attracted particular interest was that of Renee Katz, a 17-year-old student and flutist at New York's High School of Music and Art. In May, she was pushed by a stranger into the path of a subway train. She was taken to Bellevue Hospital with her severed hand, and surgeons there managed to reattach it in a long and grueling operation. When Renee Katz left the hospital last month, Bellevue doctors were hopeful that she might even be able to play the flute again. The high success rate for reattachment is due in part to better understanding of the complicated structure of nerves and how one can be grafted onto another that is partially damaged. Microsurgery is also being used for such things as replacing a cancerous esophagus with a stretch of the patient's intestine, removal of tiny pituitary tumors that can turn children into ungainly giants, and restoring mobility to a partially paralyzed face by transferring nerves. But perhaps the most exciting use of microsurgery is in the prevention of strokes. When the brain is cut off from the flow of blood by an obstruction in an artery, the result may be irreversible damage. “Stroke is by far the commonest serious disease of the nervous system and one of the most important health problems in the United States,” says Dr. Jack M. Fein, associate professor of neurosurgery at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. There are half a million new stroke victims every year; a third die within a month, while half of the rest become permanent invalids. “Contrary to what many people think, this is by no means entirely a geriatric problem,” says Dr. Fein. “Several of our patients have been in their 30's, and probably the greatest number are in their 50's and early 60's. This terrible affliction cuts down people in the prime of life.” But before a major crippling stroke, a victim usually experiences brief “warning strokes” that can last anywhere from several minutes to a whole day. “The symptoms can range from numbness in one side of the body to difficulty in speaking or writing or even temporary blindness, depending on which part of the brain is affected,” says Dr. Russel H. Patterson Jr., professor of surgery‐neurosurgery at New York Hospital‐Cornell Medical Center. Not long ago, a 40-year-old executive was talking to a client when suddenly he began to use the wrong words (since blood was unable to reach the speech center of his brain). Within two minutes, his right side was paralyzed. Within an hour, however, the symptoms had passed. The next day, his doctor referred him to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, where he was found to be an excellent candidate for an exciting new treatment made possible by microsurgery: a stroke-prevention operation. First, a CAT scanner may determine the extent of permanent tissue damage; no operation can help those whose brains have already been massively, permanently affected. If the obstruction is in the brain, the surgeon drills a hole about the size of a silver dollar through the skull and, under the high magnification of the microscope, hooks one nearby artery to another, thus bypassing the obstruction. Although only a few years old, the operation has already proved its effectiveness. The executive, who had two more warning strokes in quick succession while awaiting stroke‐prevention surgery, has had no recurrence in the two years since. Out of one group of 400 high‐risk patients of all ages studied for almost three years, only four of those who had the operation suffered strokes, in marked contrast to a control group, where almost half did. “I think this is going to have tremendous impact,” says Dr. Fein. “Up until now, we had really no way of preventing this truly terrible affliction. Almost every family in this country has at least in some way been affected by the day-to-day agony of a relative who has experienced a stroke — what one neurologist in Boston calls 'super death.’ Now, at least with a large number of people, we can try to do something about it. In the future, this kind of surgery should greatly reduce the personal, social and economic toll of this dreaded disease.” Another experimental but promising area of the new medical technology is the use of complicated electronics to restore vision to the blind and hearing to the. deaf. Five years ago, a team of scientists at the University of Utah, working with other scientists at the University of Western Ontario, electronically stimulated the brains of blind volunteers in the cerebral area known as the visual cortex so that the volunteers “saw” letters of the alphabet. An even more dramatic experiment took place four years ago. A 33-year-old man had been blinded 10 years earlier in a gunshot accident. When a television camera was connected to elec. trodes implanted on his brain, he was able to detect white horizontal and vertical lines on a dark background. “The experimental system functioned as a complete, though crude, artificial eye,” says Dr. William H. Dobelle, director of the Utah project and currently both a member of the faculty at the University of Utah and head of the Division of Artificial Organs, Department of Surgery, at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York. In a later experiment, six electrodes on the man's brain were stimulated to form an image of letters of the Braille alphabet. With this stimulation, he was able to “read” phrases and short sentences, such as, “When the crow went into ...” and “He had a cat and ball.” “Without practice, the man — who was an extremely poor Braille reader— was able to read Braille at 30 characters per minute, or five times faster than he could using his finger tips,” says Dr. Dobelle. This past December in New York, two new volunteers received implants, and so far the electrodes are functioning and they too seem to be able to visualize Braille letters. But Dr. Dobelle and his collaborators are hoping that their system will do more than help the blind to read. Essentially, our eyes are like incredibly intricate cameras that catch light, transform it into electrical impulses, and then relay it to the visual cortex in the brain, where it is translated into the complex phenomenon called vision. “As far as we know now, there seems to be no reason why this can't be artificially duplicated,” says Dr. Dobelle. He and his colleagues have already made plans for a special miniature television camera to be implanted in the eye of a volunteer and connected with wires to several hundred tiny electrodes on the brain. A CAT scanner will first be used to create an image of the volunteer's visual cortex, since the shape of each person's brain differs markedly; then the individually designed array of electrodes will be implanted, and the camera in the eye will transmit information about light patterns to the brain — the artificial equivalent of vision. “From computer simulation studies we've done, we know that with anywhere from 250 to 500 electrodes you can start getting useful results,” says Dr. Dobelle. Although he does not expect to restore normal vision completely, he nevertheless hopes that the blind will he able to read and, most important of all, to recognize people and things around them. “I hope we'll be able to give them the same sort of murky, black-and-white vision that you can see in the scratchy television pictures that early spacecraft sent back to earth,” he A related area in which Dr. Dobelle and his colleagues at Columbia and Utah are working intensively is artificial hearing. A quarter of a million Americans are totally deaf; one way to restore their hearing is to stimulate auditory nerve fibers electrically. Dr. Dobelle and his group have already implanted electrodes in the inner ears of a few volunteers — with encouraging results. One 47-year-old social worker, totally deaf for many years, was able to recognize such melodies as “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” “Yankee Doodle” and “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.” “1 believe society can be assured of the ultimate success of this research for the deaf, although of course many unforeseen obstacles doubtless remain,” says Dr. Dobelle. “Naturally what they will hear is going to be pretty tinny. Walter Cronkite may sound like Donald Duck to these people, but the important thing is that they'll be able to recognize sounds above Dr. Dobelle is the first to admit that problems remain to he faced before that goal is realized. “The last thing we want is to have hordes of people lined up outside our hospital, hoping for help that we can't yet give them,” he says. Vision and hearing are enormously complicated areas; nevertheless, on the basis of work already done, Dr. Dobelle is optimistic about the future. “I do really think that this is going to happen, that this technology is going to work,” he says. ■ Other advances in medical technology also seem to hold promise for the future. The “artificial pancreas,” developed recently by Miles Laboratories, duplicates one of the main functions of the pancreas: it regulates changes in levels of blood glucose by injecting tiny amounts of insulin into the bloodstream. Still highly experimental, it is currently being tested at a few medical centers and has not yet received final F.D.A. approval. Looking rather like a large stove on wheels, the machine is able both to monitor the glucose level in a diabetic patient and then, if it senses too much of a deviation, dole out tiny amounts of insulin for up to four days. The device has already aided several carefully selected diabetic women, who were helped through labor while attached to the machine. Doctors look forward to the day when smaller and more portable versions of the machine may help Dr. William H. Dobelle With electrodes implanted on the visual areas of his brain, this totally blind man is enabled to “see” crude images. The television camera feeds information to the computer, which then sends it to the non's brain through a disconnectable cable. the country's hundreds of thousands of diabetics lead more normal lives. A technique called nuclear magnetic resonance (N.M.R.) is also promising. Basically, the procedure involves putting groups of living cells in a strong magnetic field and then bombarding them with radio waves. A computer analyzes the amount of energy absorbed by different molecules within the cell to provide information about various events occurring within it. “Nuclear magnetic resonance allows us to see minute changes taking place within cells almost as they happen,” says one researcher at the National Institutes of Health. “We can see all sorts of things that X‐rays won't show — tracking several chemical reactions at the same time, for example.” The technique is still too new and experimental for scientists to be willing to predict many of its potential uses. But several are hopeful about the new information it will give about the differences between normal and diseased cells — how a healthy cell turns into a dangerous, malignant one, for instance, as well as what kinds of treatment work best in either halting or reversing the process. “There's a lot of excitement,” admits one scientist. “The living cell is where the action is, and N.M.R. offers one of the best ways of finding out exactly what's going on.” □ And yet, despite its promise, the new medical technology has come under increasingly sharp criticism. “Medical technologies are neither perfect nor risk‐free,” says Dr. Ivan L. Bennett Jr., provost / dean of the School of Medicine at New York University, who blames “the Marcus Welby syndrome” for the assumption that doctors — and the machines they use — can cure every case “in 30 or 60 minutes, less time out for commercials.” The history of modern medicine is crowded with techniques that were loudly praised and then quietly discarded, from using X‐ray machines in the 1940's to irradiate the thymus gland as a disease‐prevention measure (but which, in fact, has caused increased risk of thyroid cancer) to the vogue for gastric freezing as a cure for ulcers in the 1960's, long since dismissed as either ineffective or downright harmful. One much‐discussed example of potential abuse is ultrasound. Although few deny the great benefits it can bring, several in the medical community consider it almost alarmingly over‐used, particularly for fetal monitoring. All too often, they charge, technicians have misread images and imagined complications where none in fact existed; the result has been needless, and potentially harmful, Caesarian sections. “Although everyone agrees it's a great device, I think there's generally a greater sense of caution now,” admits one New York radiologist. “We do recognize that this technological advance can be misused, and that if you use a lot of ultrasound, you can cause abnormalities of fetal development.” More subtle risks may be involved in the over‐use of medical technology, too. The patient who spends more than a few days in the hospital may soon have the discouraging feeling that he is being treated by an array of machines. This is particularly true of the patient in an intensive‐care unit, where he is attached, day and night, to beeping, buzzing newly developed electronic monitors. “One of the things that happens to many of these people is that they develop what psychiatrists call an ‘I.C.U. psychosis,’” says Dr. Andrew A. Sorensen, associate professor of preventive medicine and community health at the University of Rochester Medical School. “They just stop reacting and retreat into their own world. In these cases, there are unquestionably harmful effects associated with medical technology.” Other critics predict these effects will become even more common. Despite their grudging respect for the healing potential of the new technology, their vision of the future is not a splendid one, where the ailing can be promptly and painlessly cured by a host of beneficent machines. Instead, they foresee a time when doctors will be largely transformed into technicians, operating apparatuses the layman cannot hope to fathom. The gulf of suspicion between patients and their healers, already distressingly large, will grow even wider. The general practitioner, made newly important within the past 10 years by medical schools anxious to emphasize medicine's “human face,” will be unable to compete with the sophisticated diagnostic machines that only large hospitals can afford, and may well disappear. In this gloomy view of the future, the patient arriving at a hospital will not have a single doctor at all, but will simply be led, like a reluctant child, from one machine to the next, each manned by a detached and indifferent staff. “I'm not even sure that — for many patients — this will mean better medicine,” says one critic. “We're finding out more and more how important the psychological element is in healing. If the patient feels anxious, resentful, caught in an alien and hostile environment, for many the end result of that stress may be to negate whatever superior medical ad. vantages the machines offer.” Moreover, some see the possibility of greater geographic imbalance in the availability of treatment than exist now.“There are already massive inequities in our national health‐care system,” says Dr. Andrew Sorensen. “Places like New York City, Chicago, San Francisco are very well served in some areas, but there are still many sections of the country, particularly rural ones, where the level of medical care is shockingly low.” Since only the largest urban medical centers will be able to afford the expensive new technology, in the future the disparity between the privileged metropolis and medically neglected small town is likely to grow rather than todiminish. The overall price tag of the new technology has already stirred angry debate. “Health technologies contribute enormously to the inflationary spiral,” Senator Edward M. Kennedy, chairman of the Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research, has recently said. “As much as 40 percent of the annual increase in the cost of a hospital day can be attributed to their use.” Total medical costs have soared to $182 billion (from less than a quarter of that 10 years ago), while the cost to the average person of a oneday stay in the hospital has risen from $35 in 1963 to $195 today. The medical-technology industry, responsible for manufacturing the new debillion in this country. ■ One of the favorite targets of critics has been the CAT scanner, which — at $750,000 per unit — is one of the most expensive medical machines ever manufactured. Some see hospitals’ eagerness for the device — what is called CAT fever — as a perfect illustration of what Dr. Ivan Bennett has dubbed “the technological imperative”: the compulsive urge among hospitals to acquire the latest gadgetry in order to impress patients and the medical community. “If one hospital has it, another wants it,” says one expert. “But is it the patient who President Carter himself recently criticized hospitals’ attitudes and confessed that he had once shared them. Mr. Carter said he now realizes that when he was a member of the Sumter County (Ga.) Hospital Authority (along with his uncle, mother and brother), he had “ripped people off.” “We were naturally inclined to buy a new machine whenever it became available.” he admitted. “and then to require that every patient who came into the hospital submit a blood sample or some other aspect of their body to the machine for analysis, whether they needed it or not, in order to rapidly defray the cost of purchase of the machine.” The response of many doctors to the President's increasingly strident criticism of expensive medical machines has been swift — and angry. “The new devices have saved lives and relieved suffering in countless cases,” says one. “How does the Government intend to reckon that up in dollars and cents?” Even before the CAT scanner became generally available five years ago, some point out, hospital costs were steadily rising. “Technology is being made the whipping boy by politicians looking for votes,” insists one physician at a large New York medical center. “But waste has always been a problem in hospitals. How about all the millions of dollars spent on unnecessary linen and paper slippers for patients, all the piddling expenses that keep adding up?” But in a time of soaring inflation and general retrenchment, the cost of the new technology seems to affront more than just politicians. The CAT scanner, admittedly, is superexpensive, but few of the other devices are cheap. An ultrasound unit, for example, costs up to $100,000. The usual defense offered by hospital officials. that older procedures since they required more personnel — often cost more, is usually ignored or derided: The mood in Washington and elsewhere today is stern and unforgiving. The more than 200 health‐systems agencies scattered through the country, responsible for approving large‐scale hospital expenditures, have already begun to clamp the lid down. Only about 200 hospitals a year now have their requests for CAT scanners approved — a small fraction of those who apply. “One result of this in the corporate world is that some companies have begun to edge away from expensive technical research in the health area,” says one executive with a large medical‐equipment firm. Other companies have squelched plans to research Improved versions of the CAT scanner. “Why should we invest $5 million in researching it if the Government won't let us sell it to customers?” says one official. But few belft.ve that a Government policy of strict across-the-board cost containment can really work without affecting health care. ‐The current system is ridiculous, but most plans around to change it aren't much better.” says Dr. Murray Eden, chief of the Biomedical Engineering and Instrumentation Branch of the National Institutes of Health. “There's a great need for new direction and a settling of priorities. From a purely technological point of view, the prospects for the future are glittering, but the drive to contain health‐care costs will obviously have an effect. As consumers, most of us want, demand, better health care, but we are offended when we get the bill. Somewhere there has to be some clearer thinking about where we're going to spend our money.” In just such an attempt to introduce clear thinking into the technology debate, Congress last year created the National Center for Health‐Care Technology, a part of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. “We intend to assess the value and cost of various aspects of the new medical technology and tell the public. practicing physicians, medical centers and big third‐party payers like Blue Cross‐Blue Shield what we find,” says Dr. Seymour Perry, the center's acting head. “We aim to act as a catalyst, primarily through consensus conferences held every few months or so about different devices and procedures. Our findings won't have the force of law, but they will have the prestige of prominent members of the medical community behind them. That will count for a lot more than if some bureaucrat in Washington has the final say.” Whether the center can truly help to settle the debate remains to be seen, but its establishment has been generally if hardly lavishly — welcomed in the medical community. “Most of all we hope to influence attitudes,” says Dr. Perry. “Americans have long had a love affair with technology. As a people, we are finally going to have to take a good hard look at our limited resources and see which of the new devices around should he allowed to survive and spread. Our aim should be to make sure that medical technology is our servant and never becomes our master.” ■"
New Techniques Aid Prenatal Testing,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/08/05/archives/connecticut-weekly-new-techniques-aid-prenatal-testing.html,"NEW HAVEN IIIHYSICIANS and researchers at Yale‐New Haven Hospital have reported significant advances within the last 10 years in the prenatal detection of certain fetal defects, including anemia and hemophilia. “Research into birth‐defect detection,” said Dr. John Hobbins, “is something women are going to begin demanding in the future. And I suspect that if the public becomes more educated there will be a turnaround in the low numbers of women taking advantage of prenatal testing.” Fewer than 10 percent of Connecticut women use prenatal testing. “This is consistent with the national average,” said Dr. Hobbins, director of obstetrics and high‐risk pregnancies at the hospital. Using fetoscopy, a procedure involving drawing blood from the underside of the placenta, doctors from medical schools at Yale, the University of Connecticut and Case Western Reserve have been able to determine before birth whether a child would have hemophilia. The procedure was developed by Dr. Hobbins and his associate, Dr. Maurice J. Mahoney, and they reported their findings in The New England Journal of Medicine. Hemophilia, a hereditary disorder that causes uncontrolled bleeding, affects only males. The mother carries the disease, but does not necessarily pass it on to all her sons. Now, pregnant women who are suspected of being carriers can be given an amniocentesis test to determine the sex of the child, and those who are found to be carrying male fetuses are tested further. Using tha fetoscopy, blood samples are drawn and analyzed to determine if the fetus lacks the clotting factor that normally controls bleeding. Doctors using the same fetoscopy procedure were able a few months ago to isolate the single gene in a human cell that enabled them to detect the fatal form of anemia called delta beta thalassemia. The research in this area has led to early detection of the more common form of anemia that affects children in the United States. Mothers who learn from this test that they are carrying a hemophiliac child or one suffering from the fatal form of thalassemia may choose to terminate the pregnancy. Is abortion always the choice in the case of birth defects, or is the recent work with genes bringing us to an era of genetic repair? “At the moment the choice is usually abortion,” said Dr. Robbins. “Few women who know they are carrying a child with a severe birth defect would consider carrying it to term. But most couples who come here already know that they have a history of genetic abnormality in their family, or they have a child with a genetic birth defect and don't want another. “In most cases of genetic birth defects, when a parent tells us that they plan to abort anyway, we feel that if we can tell them that their child will probably be normal — if that's what our testing shows — then we are saving those children who would otherwise be aborted.” Dr. Hobbins and Dr. Mahoney devised the fetoscopy technique because they were dissatisfied with amniocentesis alone for detecting birth defects. In amniocentesis a sample of the fluid surrounding the fetus is drawn and is analyzed for various types of birth defects. It has been especially useful in detecting Down's syndrome (mongolism) and is generally recommended for pregnant women over 35. ■"
Science Watch,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/08/07/archives/science-watch-cannibal-galaxy.html,"An American astronomer has reported evidence that some galaxies may be cannibals, swallowing up nearby galaxies and thereby casting doubt on some generally accepted theories of how galaxies are born. Galaxies are fundamental subdivisions of the universe. They are the island colonies in which most of the matter of the universe appears to be concentrated, consisting of primordial gas and dust clouds as well as hundreds of millions of stars. The finding of apparent cannibalism was reported by F. Schweizer at a recent meeting of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. Dr. Schweizer and his colleagues did their work at the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory in Chile. This observatory's threeyear‐old, 158‐inch telescope has made a series of startling discoveries about the skies of the southern hemisphere. Dr. Schweizer, whose work was described in the journal Science News, said that a detailed study of a galaxy known as NGC 1316 revealed evidence that it had devoured a small galaxy roughly equivalent to 100 million times the mass of our sun. Radio observations showed that the apparent victim continues to rotate inside NGC 1316 while the cannibal does not rotate. The fact that NGC 1316 emits strong radio signals could be explained by gas falling into it from the smaller galaxy it has consumed, Dr. Schweizer said. The astronomer suspects that galactic cannibalism is a common phenomenon, because deformities in the shape of NGC 1316 resemble those of many other galaxies. It this is the case, he said, galaxies must be born near each other in pairs or larger groups, rather than as single, widely spaced entities, as has been the general belief. Abortion's Effect Recent studies have underestimated the sense of loss women feel after undergoing an abortion, in the opinion of Dr. Shahla Cherazi, assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of California in San Francisco. Writing in the current issue of the Journal of the American Medical Women's Association, Dr. Cherazi said clinical experience led her to believe that women often experience ambivalence before ending an unwanted pregnancy and guilt, grief, sadness and depression afterwards. Nevertheless, the positive effects of abortion outweigh the negative ones, Dr. Cherazi emphasized. She also said that when abortion is denied women who “need and want” the operation, “we observe grave consequences later in the mother‐infant relationship.” Before the Supreme. Court legalized abortion, psychiatrists generally believed that the deliberate termination of pregnancy was likely to have serious, long‐term psychological‐consequences. According to Dr. Cherazi, recent research based on questionnaires has stressed the relief experienced by abortion patients and has revealed little or no guilt or grief. Magnetic Detection A team of British physicists has discovered some unexpected variations in the magnetic properties of old coins, and the researchers believe their finding will give archeologists a valuable new tool in tracing change in ancient civilizations. Dr. B.K. Tanner and colleagues at the University of Durham reported in the journal Nature that magnetic variations in ancient coins are probably related to differences in the ores from which metal was smelted. The use of different ores by a single civilization can provide clues about changes in its economy and technology and help in fixing dates. The Durham team studied ancient coins made of copper‐based alloys, which in themselves are not magnetic but which sometimes contain iron impurities. One such coin, a Roman semis, was minted during the reign of Emperor Nero in 63‐44 AD. Although made of a Roman copper‐zinc alloy called orichalcum, it was found to contain about 1 percent iron, giving it pronounced magnetic properties. While coin telephones and vending machines usually contain crude fraudprevention devices to detect ferromagnetic slugs used in place of legal coins, the techniques developed by the British group are apparently able to detect very subtle differences among genuine coins. In particular, the technique has helped them determine a chronology of coins minted by the little‐known Kushan Empire, which until the middle of the Fourth Century AD dominated the caravan routes in a region now occupied by southern Russia, Afghanistan and Pakistan's Northwest Frontier. Metal Pollution A Canadian scientist compiling the research results of many other investigators has concluded that man is now dumping fine particles of certain metals into earth's atmosphere at some 20 times the rate of such natural pollutors as volcanoes, forest fires and sea spray. Concern about metallic contamination of the air is growing as evidence mounts that some metals are extremely dangerous to public health. The New England Journal of Medicine reported recently, for example, that there appears to be a link between learning disabilities in children and high exposure to atmospheric lead and cadmium. The new study of metallic contaminants, prepared by Dr. Jerome 0. Nriagu of Canada's National Water Research Institute, was published in the British scientific journal Nature."

DEATH IN THE FAMILY,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/08/12/archives/death-in-the-family.html,"Marsha and Gary, like many couples, learned that defects in their genes doomed their first child. Now medical advances help prevent such tragedy. How much despair can a young couple endure when they receive their baby's death sen- tence? When their in- tense feeling of anger and bitterness sur- faces, at whom can they direct it? Their doctors? The rabbi and the elders of their synagogue? Their parents? Themselves? The cruelest truth of all comes later: If each one had married someone else, they would have been spared. Such agonizing questions are facing more and more young couples these days because of steady advances in medical genetics. This once‐arcane field is moving rapidly forward through research developments and a growing awareness among physicians and their patients that the birth of many genetically defective children can be prevented. But with such prevention comes inevitable suffering. People who once might have accepted the birth of an abnormal child as something over which they could have no control now often must confront frightening truths and difficult decisions. Dr. Harold M. Nitowsky, a geneticist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University in New York City who is an expert in Tay‐Sachs disease, the “Jewish” disease, begins this poignant story that illustrates how parents and doctors must try to cope with these new dilemmas. Dr. Nitowsky is a quiet, seemingly shy physician who is regarded with awe by some of the couples who come to his office. He sits behind his desk, hands folded on top, the intensity of his feelings occasionally peeking through his quiet man- “Marsha's and Gary's case goes back to Oct. 6, 1975. I remember it vividly,” he begins. “It was a Monday. The preceding day we were involved in a screening program for Tay‐Sachs dispose at Central Synagogue on Lexington Avenue in Manhattan. We have screened approximately 10,000 people in the New York metropolitan area and we have had screenings in Albany, Syracuse, Stony Brook and generally covered much of the state. Tay‐Sachs carriers - people who have the Tay‐Sachs gene - are 10 times more prevalent among the Jewish population who have their ancestral origins in central and eastern Europe. These are the Ashkenazy Jews. Among couples of this background the disease is present in about one in every 2,500 births. Among the non‐Jewish population, it is much lower, per- we wanted to attempt mass screening in this Jewish population. And that's what we were doing at that synagogue on that Sunday. Tay‐Sachs has an early onset and leads to a rapid deterioration of the central nervous system. Tay‐Sachs children lose contact with their environment and show regression in whatever capabilities they develop in terms of motor development. They eventually have to be tube‐fed. They become spastic and have convulsions. The end of their diceace is a vegetative state. The cause of death is usually an infection or pneumonia. They become debilitated because it is very hard to maintain their nutrition. These children have been known to live up to 5 years of age, but many die at 2 or 3. However, Tay‐Sachs is a genetic disease whose carriers can be easily screened. “We received this call from a young man. He had heard about the screening and called the synagogue and asked to speak to one of the doctors. He was very, very distraught. He was crying, obviously terribly upset. He said his daughter had just been diagnosed as having Tay‐Sachs. He asked if we could see her as soon as possible, so we made arrangements. “Their names were Marsha and Gary. They had been married for five years. This was their first child, born 11 months earlier. She was apparently doing very well and even recognizing faces, rolling over and smiling and so on. But she was never able to sit up unsupported. At about 4 or 5 months of age she was noted to have a startled reaction to loud noise, which is an early clinical sign. “Marsha and Gary began expressing some concern their pediatrician and he allayed their fears, saying things seemed to be going along O.K. Of course, you never know what patients’ perceptions are. But during the course of the next several months they noted that the pediatrician often was checking the baby's eyes with ophthalmoscope. During that time the baby began showing less attentiveness. She rolled over less frequently and became less responsive. They really became quite concerned. They were eventually referred to an ophthalmologist because the pediatrician must have spotted something in the fundus of the eye. He probably saw the cherry‐red spot. The ophthalmologist found the spot. On the basis of their Jewish ancestry and the infant's medical history, he made presumptive diagnosis of TaySachs disease. “It's ironic that they are residents of Queens and live in a neighborhood where we had a Tay‐Sachs carrier‐testing program 18 months earlier. They never heard of the testing. So this shows you how when you mount what you think is a very good education program, you still are not reaching all the people, particularly many of the young people whom you need to reach most. We had announcements on the radio and in the local press, but they weren't attuned. People bear what they want to hear. So in a sense this could have been prevented if we had gotten to them then. We could have detected the fact they were both carriers of the Tay‐Sachs gene with a simple blood test.” ☐ Marsha and Gary are a handsome young couple who live in a single‐family house they've remodeled on a small plot a few blocks from the Utopia Parkway. It is a neighborhood of tree‐shaded streets and old single- and doublefamily houses. Gary's family business manufactures cardboard boxes in a plant nearby on Long Island. He works there with his father and brother. Marsha is a financial officer with an air‐freight company. I spoke with them in their home and quickly realized the intensity of the emotion that talking about their ordeal unleashed. At first, they both talked at once, constantly interrupting one another, their words pouring out almost uncontrollably. As we talked, they seemed to become calmer, as if the opportunity to tell their story to an outsider was cathartic experience, a form It was a hot summer day and Marsha wore shorts and sandals, sitting cross‐legged on the couch in their den. Gary sat at the other end of the couch, sipping a beer; he had come in from sunbathing in the backyard. “I honestly had never heard of Tay‐Sachs until Jennifer was 8 months old,” Marsha said. “We were in Florida with friends. One night a friend of my girlfriend came over and the topic came up. This girl was talking about this disease because she had received a telegram saying that her sister had been found to be a carrier. Therefore, her sister was telling her to go and be tested. She had gone to a doctor and he couldn't even tell her where to go for the testing. She was griping about how incompetent these doctors were. I said, ‘What are you talking about?’ She said, ‘Tay- “We didn't then make the connection to Jennifer at all. but we did feel something was wrong. I think”Gary blocked it out more than 1. From the time she was about 81/2 months, I became convinced that something was wrong. My pediatrician would say that she was slow but would catch up. This must have been bothering me when I was in Florida because I made an appointment to take Jennifer to my girlfriend's pediatrician. He examined her and said. Are you happy with your daughter's progress?’ I told him no. He did a quick test and said her motor skills were at the 4-month-old level. He said it could mean nothing, but if I was going to be in Florida for a while he could arrange a neurological examination. But we were coming back to New York, so he said I should speak to my pediatrician in New York. When I did, my New York pediatrician just said all the doctors in Florida are neurotic. They test for everything.” Gary picked up the story: “We were going to the same pediatrician who had cared for me as a child. I had a lot of confidence in him. I felt I knew him well. But we were new parents. We didn't know the progression that a baby makes as it grows. We did realize she was very slow. When she was 11 months old her eyes started to cross. Marsha was still complaining that something was wrong and I was getting worried, too. Marsha was ill so I took Jennifer to the pediatrician. I told him our concerns, and he suggested we get her eyes checked. He sent the Marsha interrupted: “You see, I was working full time. I had someone in the house during the day. But I was ready to quit my job. I felt that I was failing Jenny by working. thought I didn't give Jenny enough time to teach her things. I felt guilty. I was convincing myself that I was at fault. But Gary said I shouldn't quit. He said, ‘You can't teach her to crawl and sit up.’ “Gary was very confident up to this point because the pediatrician was a doctor who had been his doctor as a boy. Gary felt he was really qualified. But the ophthalmologist did a quick eye exam and said, ‘I see a grave situation. I think you should go back and see your pediatrician.’ “Well, my God, I was about to explode. I cornered him and said, ‘What do you mean, a grave situation?’ I wasn't leaving until he told me. So he said he was pretty sure it was Tay‐Sachs, a 90 percent chance. We left his office and went right back to the pediatri- cian's office, and he just looked at us as if he couldn't do anything. And then we knew that he had known all along. He looked at Jenny there in his office, and she was smiling and moving around and he said, ‘I wasn't sure because she was responding up to a certain point, more than the usual Tay‐Sachs baby.’ He made it clear that basically he didn't want to handle Jenny any more. He told us to contact the National Tay‐Sachs Association.” “My parents had been concerned, too,” Gary said. “They felt Jenny wasn't progressing either. They wanted to know the results of the eye examination as soon as we knew. They had gone away for the weekend. I called them and they drove back home and came to our house on Sunday. We were just sitting around the den feeling terribly depressed, and my dad suddenly said he remembered seeing a notice about a testing program in some synagogue. He found out where the testing was and put me on the phone. I was a wreck by that time, not making much sense. That's when we met Dr. Nitowsky and Sandy Silverman and the others. They are fantastic people‐” ☐ Sandy Silverman joined Dr. Nitowsky's staff as a genetics counselor in 1972. “Tay‐Sachs disease is a particularly brutal one,” she told me. “I've been in the room when couples have had that terrible death sentence pronounced for their child. It's horrible for everyone - the person giving the sentence and those receiving it. Very often, even though other physicians are fairly sure, they will push off on the geneticist the problem of telling the family. “I've learned to watch the couple when they are told. They do one of two things. They either move together, physically reach for each other. Or they move apart. One man jumped up and ran out of the room. Gary and Marsha came together. They reached out and touched each other. I saw this happen again and again during their ordeal. When one was down the other was strong. Marsha was strong during the early period while Gary was nearly going to pieces. Later, when Marsha was down, Gary was strong. “The first day they came to us Dr. Nitowsky drew blood for laboratory analysis. When he examined the eyes he could see the cherry‐red spot. However, there are some other diseases that masquerade as Tay‐Sachs. Dr. Nitowsky laid it out and was not optimistic. He said if the blood tests revealed that it was Tay‐Sachs they were fortunate in one respect. There is a prenatal test for Tay‐Sachs. That meant Marsha could have this test during the second trimester of each pregnancy and have an abortion if the baby was affected. They would be able to have normal children. When a couple finishes with Dr. Nitowsky and come out of his office, I kind of hover over them. They can't get rid of the emotions they're feeling. So Gary and Marsha came into my office and sat down and cried. And we talked. And after that Marsha just started calling me. Gary was really having almost a physical breakdown, and there was a time when she “Like so many people in this situation, they needed a neutral party to talk to‐. Friends or relatives don't understand the problem and they often talk in reassuring platitudes of hope when there is no hope. That can be more cruel in the end. Marsha needed a neutral party, someone who knew that her child was going to die. “There is something you must understand about a recessive genetic disease. It's subtle. But eventually it occurs to most couples like Marsha and Gary. If their baby has a recessive condition, then that means each of them could have a normal baby with somebody else, with almost anybody else. When this realization comes, it challenges the relationship. I've seen marriages that became very shaky. I've seen couples separate. There is enormous guilt. It's a difficult test.” Each of us has from six to eight recessive deleterious genes. Most people can live a lifetime and never know they exist. They are revealed only if we marry someone carrying the same recessive gene and one of the children receives a double dose. This is how it works: Rod‐shaped chromosomes exist in similar, or homologous, attached pairs in the nuclei of human cells. Residing in these chromosomes are the genes that convey hereditary traits; in fact, each trait is controlled by a double gene or a double‐gene sequence — one gene residing in one chromosome and the other in the other chromosome at the corresponding spot. In the initial formation of eggs and sperm, the chromosome pairs split apart. One sperm or egg gets the genes from one chromosome, another sperm or egg gets the genes from the other chromosome. A recessive gene, the TaySachs gene, for example, exists at a certain spot on a chromosome. Its partner at the same spot on the other chromosome of the pair is normal. Thus, in someone who carries the Tay‐Sachs gene, half of the sperm or eggs have the normal gene, half have the Tay‐Sachs gene. At the moment of fertilization, a sperm and egg come together and the newly created individual has a full complement of genetic material — half from the sperm and half from the egg. The genetic makeup of this new person can reflect several possibilities. There is a 25 percent chance that a normal egg and a normal sperm will come together, creating an individual who has no Tay‐Sachs gene and need never worry about his or her children being afflicted. There is a 50 percent chance that an abnormal egg or sperm will fertilize a normal egg or sperm, creating an individual with one Tay‐Sachs gene. This person won't be affected with the disease, but will carry the gene. If such a person marries somebody without the TaySachs gene, their children will not be born with the disease. But if the spouse also carries the gene, there is a risk. Finally, when two Tay‐Sachs carriers marry, there is a 25 percent chance that a sperm with the gene will fertilize an egg with the gene, giving the baby the double dose, and causing the disease to be present. That's what happened to Jennifer. Most people are blithely unaware of their genetic heritage. Because of the nature of recessive disorders, a family can go for generations without knowing about the gene's presence. In the daily course of their work, geneticists often see the result of people's ignorance of their genetic heritage. Geneticists recognized early that one means to deal with this might be to identify members of a particular population at risk because of some genetic malady and attempt to screen them before they have children — to uncover the hidden deleterious genes and at least apprise a person of the risk so he or she will not produce Tay‐Sachs affects people of Jewish descent whose forebears came from central and eastern Europe. A simple blood test can reveal whether such individuals carry the gene. Another genetic disease found in a specific population is sickle‐cell anemia. An estimated two million blacks carry the sickle‐cell gene, and a simple blood test can reveal its presence. Although there are no tests for the cystic-fibrosis gene, an estimated 10 million whites carry it; when a blood test is developed — and it no doubt will be — a large segment of the population will benefit. Many states now require blood tests of newborn babies for a half dozen or more diseases. Nevertheless, the idea of screening various ethnic groups for a genetic defect, however laudable the intentions, brings chills to many civil libertarians. They worry that the results can be used for more than simply apprising an individual of the presence of a deleterious gene. Beyond such questions, there is also doubt about the efficacy of mass screenings — the cost, the ability to reach target populations and availability of medical manpower to carry out the screening and then properly counsel those in whom an unwanted gene has been discov- “Screening for Tay‐Sachs has not received as much criticism as some other kinds of screening programs, notably for carriers of the sickle‐cell trait among the black population,” Dr. Nitowsky said. “In that case, I think there was inadequate education of the target population. People who were revealed to be carriers of the trait misinterpreted the information and thought they had the disease. A certain stigma came to be attached to being revealed as a carrier again mistakenly. These people couldn't get insurance. They were refused jobs. ... We geneticists are attuned to biological differences, but we must pay attention to cultural and social differences, too.... No one expects to be a carrier. It can't happen. So when someone is identified as a carrier, it can be quite disturbing. People need counseling and explanations. This approach generally works in adults, but I object strongly to mass screening of children, high‐school students, for example. They simply aren't prepared. . . Education is the answer in the end - education of the healthcare providers and educationof the public.” ☐ After learning that they are carriers for a recessive genetic condition, and that their daughter had received a double dose of the gene and would eventually die from it, Marsha and Gary felt an intense anger burning within them, building up to the exploding point. Gary in particular searched for someone to blame. He turned first to the pediatrician, the man who had been his doctor as a child. “I called our pediatrician about two weeks later, because I felt I was close with him. I said, ‘Did you know?’ He told me he thought he had seen it some months before. ‘I didn't see any reason to tell you any sooner until she displayed more evidence of the disease.’ He said he wanted to let us love her and enjoy her. He probably thought we wouldn't believe him anyway. Maybe we wouldn't have. I asked him when we should bring Jenny in next. He told us to call the Tay‐Sachs Association. He said not to waste our money bringing her back to him. He certainly washed his “I had and still have a lot of resentment about what happened to us, because I feel it could have been prevented. was just angry that we weren't given the option of knowing. Somewhere along the line someone should have told us. But no one wants to take the responsibility. “I've heard some doctors say that informing Jewish couples about Tay‐Sachs isn't their concern because it's religious thing. We had a very progressive rabbi then. Actually he was my father's rabbi. We drove over to his house the day we found out and he was wonderful. Later, we had other meetings with him and at one meeting I asked him why a rabbi will marry a couple without first telling them about Tay‐Sachs and the tests, and where to get them and what the risk is. He said there is enough pressure on a couple before getting married and he didn't feel that it was the proper thing to do. This was an attitude he said a lot of his fellow rabbis had. He said that it is a medical problem. “We later became involved with another rabbi who is quite progressive. He started some seminars to discuss TaySachs. Had doctors come as speakers and so on. But the attendance was poor. People don't want to know. They just don't want to know. “I have a lot of guilt about not knowing about this disease. I have a lot of resentment about not being told. You might ask whether my parents were aware of it. Why didn't they say something? I don't think they knew about TaySachs. To tell you the truth, have never sat down with them to talk about it. I don't want them to feel I have any resentment against them.” ☐ There is a dichotomy of emotions swirling about the parents of a Tay‐Sachs child. On one level is the guilt about what they have done to their child, the remorse and the desire to atone. But on another level is the desire to replace their defective child with a genetically whole child and a subconscious wish that the Tay‐Sachs child die. Within six months of Jennifer's diagnosis, Marsha became pregnant. At 16 weeks’ gestation she went to Einstein for an amniocentesis. Dr. Nitowsky stood beside her and held her hand while the obstetrician performed the amniotic tap. It takes three weeks for the fetus's cells in the amniotic fluid to grow out in tissue culture so that the tests for the presence of an enzyme called hex A can be performed. The enzyme levels reveal whether the fetus is normal, a carrier of Tay‐Sachs or affected with the disease. But the Einstein doctors have developed a preliminary test that can be performed on the amniotic fluid the same day it is removed from the The preliminary test indicated that Marsha's baby would be normal, and the formal results three weeks later bore that out. Marsha's and Gary's son — the amniocentesis had also revealed its sex would not carry the Tay‐Sachs genes at all. He need never worry about the disease striking his children. Marsha's pregnancy was uncomplicated. Jennifer had been delivered by Caesarean section and Marsha was scheduled to have her second baby the same way. Ironically, Joshua was born on Jennifer's second birthday. He was normal and blood tests revealed that the amniocentesis was correct — he carried no Tay‐Sachs genes. “For about two weeks, Marsha and Gary just suspended their emotions,” Sandy Silverman recalls. “They felt disloyal to Jennifer by loving this new baby. A Tay‐Sachs couple must work out their feelings. They experience difficult emotional gymnastics. You know that on one level they are wishing their affected child would die. But another part of them wants the child to keep fighting. Marsha and Gary had these feelings. We talked about it. “There is one word you can't say to a Tay‐Sachs couple. I could never bring myself to utter it to Marsha and Gary. The word is replacement. Replacement of the Tay‐Sachs child with a new, normal child. Marsha and Gary wanted a girl so badly and Josh was not a girl. They were unhappy about it but didn't understand why. ... It's very difficult for a Tay‐Sachs couple to admit to such feelings. They don't want to be disloyal to their ill child. “Each couple must work things out for themselves. Each couple copes differently. Marsha and Gary went far beyond the call of duty. They kept Jennifer at home long after most couples would have given up. After an initial period of grief, Tay‐Sachs parents begin to think of institutionalization because their child will soon reach a vegetative state. But not Marsha and Gary. “They had a special nurse who lived with the child. When the nurse was gone they cared for her. One of them had to be with her all the time. If one went out, the other stayed home. They stopped doing things as a couple. They had Jenny on a suction machine because she could choke. They learned how to feed her through a nasogastric tube and did that. They used to take her onto their bed at night and play with her long after there was any response. But they imagined response. They imagined that she still recognized them long after she stopped. “We would see them periodically and advise them against keeping Jennifer at home, but Gary wouldn't hear of it. Finally, Marsha began to crack. She called one day and said she was near the breaking point. She was ready to institutionalize Jenny, but Gary said no. It was about time for them to bring the child in for an examination by Dr. Nitowsky. He examined her and told them she had to be institution. alized. Gary finally agreed. It was as if Dr. Nitowsky released him from part of his guilt. “When Joshua was 1 year old, which was also Jenny's third birthday, Marsha told me something that reduced me to tears when I hung up the telephone. She told me how they had split the day so that they could spend part of it with Jenny at the hospital celebrating and the other part at home with Josh celebrating. At first you think what a lack of being in touch with reality that shows. But what we know is that a couple must work it out, assuage their guilt, make their sacrifice, cope as far as they can. .. . All the ritual Marsha and Gary have gone through think in the long run will free them when Jennifer dies. It will free them to love Josh even more than they do now, to be able to have another child, be able be all right. ” ☐ “We had a special nurse who lived with us,” Marsha said. “She lived in Jenny's room and stayed with us from Sunday night to Saturday morning. So Gary and I took care of her Saturdays and Sundays. We would sleep downstairs with her. We did that for two years because I had a fear that she would choke and I wouldn't be in the room. You just couldn't leave her alone. We practically lived in her room. During the day we would bring Josh in and play with him on the floor. “The only problem we ever really had was fevers, which we learned was usual for TaySachs children. ... She just lay there with her eyes open, no movement, no brain activity to speak of. As for the daily routine, she was being fed by a nasogastric tube. The tube had to be inserted three times a week. We went to North Shore Hospital and learned how to insert it so we could tube‐feed her. But Gary was much better at it than I was. He was better even than the doctors in the hospital. Three evenings a week we took it out and she would sleep overnight without it. She was getting phenobarbital as a tranquilizer and we would take the tube out after we gave her the phenobarb. Then Gary would insert it the next morning. “With a Tay‐Sachs child all you can do is make them comfortable. They require little, if anything. Her care was never difficult at all, other than the constant moving her so she wouldn't lie in one spot and get bedsores, and the feeding. She had to be moved every hour. We had a suction machine in the house. She did have trouble with her saliva and choking. So we had to constantly suction her if she needed it.” “The rough time was in the night.” Gary said “Later on, when she began to have problems with the tube, we slept in the room with her. We took her out of the crib and brought her into the bed we bad in her room. That way we could hear her immediately if anything was wrong - if she began to choke. On week‐nights we had the nurse in her room. But we had an intercom in our bedroom upstairs and we heard every sound in Jenny's room. Marsha was always very worried that she might not hear Jenny choking. Marsha learned to listen for any change in the sounds coming from Jenny's room and she would wake up instantly. The hard. “Once Josh was born it became very difficult, particularly for Marsha. I was still all wrapped up in Jenny. I tried hard to love the new baby, but, frankly, it was difficult at first. As far as I was concerned Jenny was going to stay at home until I was told it wasn't right anymore.” “There came a point where felt it wasn't a healthy family situation anymore,” Marsha interrupted. “It had been over a year since we really did anything or were out of the house together. Any activity, such as family holidays, either Gary would go or I would go. One of us stayed home. Jenny had a very low resistance to infection, so we didn't have any children of our friends in the house for more than a year, and the reactions of our friends is another whole story. It difficult for them be I with us. We were down about what had happened. We were jealous of their healthy kids. I remember seeing a child who was five months younger than Jenny doing things Jenny never did. Not that I wanted any harm to come to that child, but it was so bard to admit that here is this child doing things my daughter never did. I was jealous. Finally, everything started bothering me. ... It wasn't fair to Josh. He was cooped up at home with us - tied to Jenny's room, too. It wasn't healthy for of us. “Yet the time I felt guilty the most was when we decided to put her in the hospital. knew we had done more than most parents would do, but felt guilty. How can a mother do something like that? ... Still, she was better off.” ☐ A few months after Jennifer was hospitalized, Marsha became pregnant for the third time. Late in 1977 she went to Einstein for an amniocentesis. Unlike the first one, this amniotic tap was difficult. The obstetrician drew blood on the first attempt and had to keep trying until he retrieved some clear fluid. It was a long and anxiety‐provoking session. Marsha left the treatment room badly shaken. But the preliminary results the next day indicated that the child was unaffected. Marsha and Gary celebrated quietly. The third pregnancy was particularly important to them, because Marsha had been told she could tolerate no more than three Caesarean sections. This child probably was their last. Originally, they bad wanted a large family. The couple was unprepared for the call Dr. Nitowsky put in to Marsha at work three weeks later. He wanted her and Gary to come to his office as soon as possible. He said he had some bad news. The amniocentesis results indicated the baby Marsha was carrying would be affected with Tay‐Sachs. A member of Einstein's obstetrics faculty examined Marsha and suggested a method of aborting the fetus vaginally, thus giving her a chance for another pregnancy. Shortly thereafter, Marsha successfully underwent the abortion. which was for her a devastating experience. She entered a period of depression and despair that rivaled the emotional extremes that had plagued Gary two years before when he learned his daughter would slowly deteriorate and die. Sandy Silverman saw the young couple reach for each other again - Gary strong now, holding up his faltering ☐ When we began talking in Marsha's and Gary's den, it was early afternoon. Josh had learned to walk and was into everything. First Marsha and then Gary would jump up and rescue him from some impending disaster as he tugged at a lamp cord or pulled at a bookcase. The affection they held for their son was obvious. They were the epitome of doting parents. But it was easy to imagine their conflicting feelings generated by this handsome boy and Jennifer, who at that moment lay in a hospital a few miles away, nearly 1 years old but unsmiling, unseeing, unfeeling and unthinking. Were they resigned? Were they still bound by their guilt and secretly resenting her? Or were they merely pulling away, anticipating her inevitable death? She already had lived longer than most Tay- “She's a very strong girl. It's amazing,” Marsha said, a curious note of pride in her voice. “Congestion, which interferes with their breathing and eventually leads to pneumonia, is the main problem that all the children in the ward have. But Jenny seems to be in very good shape compared to even the younger children, who are constantly choking and congesting. She's able to spit up the saliva and phlegm.” “We visit her several times a week,” Gary said. “I go several times at night. Marsha makes it whenever she can. And then we go together on the weekends. My time there is maybe 10 minutes or 15 minutes. There's nothing to do. I hold her and I cuddle her a little bit. I'll kiss her. I'll talk to her, but of course I'm really talking to myself because she doesn't comprehend anything I'm saying. Sometimes I'll try to lift her. She's uncomfortable when being lifted. She has these seizures. On the weekends, we both bathe her and I do lift her up and hold her for just a couple of minutes.” “Bathing her gives you something to do,” Marsha added. “I enjoy it. Somehow feel better after I bathe her and fix her hair. She just looks so ... pretty, so terrific.” After Jenny turned 4 and Josh 2, I spoke to Gary and Marsha again. I asked how they had marked the two birthdays. “We went to the hospital,” Gary said. “We usually go on Sunday morning and the birthday happened to be on Sunday this year. But there was no celebration. In our own way we said, ‘Happy Birthday, Jenny,’ and brought cards from the family and friends who do still remember. You buy her a new nightgown, which is really all she can use.” “When I visit her, I'm usually fine and under control,” Marsha interrupted. “The only time I have a problem is on her birthday. I usually spend a half hour or 45 minutes on my visits. But on her birthday I cut it short. It's a difficult time. When I was in labor with Josh and realized that he was going to be born on the same date as Jenny, I wasn't too thrilled about it. But everyone said it was a good omen and there's a reason for it. In a way now I'm kind of glad. come home from the hospital and I'm forced to be happy for I mentioned Sandy Silverman's comment about how Tay‐Sachs parents either come together or move apart when they learn the news and her memory of Gary and Marsha physically reaching for one another. “We have become incredibly close,” Marsha said. “It forces you to either talk about it or hate each other for it,” Gary said. They confided that Marsha was pregnant again. At the proper time they would go to Einstein for another amniocentesis. From the hesitant way they discussed it, I knew they were trying not to think about the 25 percent chance that the baby growing in Marsha's womb had received a Tay‐Sachs gene from each of them. But six months later, a normal healthy boy, David, was born. Shortly after that, on July 14, 1979, the life of little Jennifer came to an end. “She was a fighter,” Sandy Silverman said. “But Marsha's and ordeal is over.”"
CONNECTICUT JOURNAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/08/12/archives/connecticut-weekly-connecticut-journal-gassticker-bids-governors.html,"THE gasoline lines may have disappeared since odd‐even sales restrictions were imposed in June, but the beat goes on in the applications from motorists seeking exemptions to buy gas on any day, State energy officials of the Office of Policy and Management are still receiving 50 to 200 applications each day from motorists seeking the magic sticker for their windshields that would permit them to buy gasoline on any day of the week instead of the odd or even days corresponding with the last digit on their license plates. “It never ends,” said Mary Hart, an agency spokesman. Mrs. Hart said state officials cited the continuing run of applications as an indication that the odd‐even restrictions were still effective. She said: “People say the odd‐even system isn't working or that it's being ignored, but if it's not working, why are all the people still applying to get exemptions?” Since June 19, when the Governor's executive order established the restrictions, state officials have received some 40,000 applications for exemptions from persons saying that buying gas on an odd or even day is a hardship for them. About 9,000 exemptions have been approved and 15,000 have been rejected. The rest are still being processed or have been sent back to the applicants for more documentation to show that they must buy a tank of gas more frequently than every other day. “When the crunch eased somewhat, many people just didn't send the applications back,” Mrs. Hart said. The energy emergency center, which was set up in the state armory near the Capitol in Hartford, is still operating to monitor the program and to process applications, but with a much smaller staff that now can fit into one room. • The ads in a couple of community newspapers said that there would be tag sale last Saturday at a house on Duck River Lane in Old Lyme, a common happening on these summer weekends. But some of the people who wandered by to look over the sale were star- tied to find that it was the summer home of Governor Grasso. The Governor, who has trouble passing up a tag sale or a bargain herself, was cleaning house to make room for future acquisitions. “Oh my God, this is the Governor's sale,” one woman exclaimed to a companion as she walked up the driveway. When another woman told the Governor that she had seen the ad for the sale but had not realized who was having it, Mrs. Grasso replied: “That was the way it was planned, that you wouldn't realize it.” The Grassos had tried to get everything organized in the driveway the night before, but a shower forced them to haul the clothing, household goods, jelly glasses, mirrors, Christmas tree lights and such back into the garage and then out again the next morning. Though the sale wasn't to start until 9 A.M., one early‐bird shopper showed up at 7. The shopper, a gray‐haired woman, apologized for being a little early but the Governor told her: “Oh, go right ahead. Don't mind me. I'm just getting some of these things out. Are you interested in pocketbooks? I've got a great collection of those over there— $2 each.” On a tree near the garage were about 15 pocketbooks belonging to the Governor and her daughter, Susane. When another shopper arrived with cardboard box, the Governor exclaimed: “Now that's the kind of shopper I like -- one that brings her own box.” Leaning against a tree was a framed finger‐painting of a stout woman dressed in a red dress with a blue sash, which Susane had painted as a child. Mrs. Grasso said the painting was not of her. Another item was a wicker basket that the Governor herself had bought at a tag sale but didn't have room to keep. She said she was having the sale because her husband, Tom, “says we have too much stuff as it is. Now I can start going again.” Mrs. Grasso grossed about $680 on the sale, an aide reported later, and although she was not required to do it, she wrote out a check for 7 percent of the proceeds and sent it to the state Tax Department for the state sales tax. • The departure of Representative Anthony Toby Moffett from next year's United States Senate race has shifted the political action to the Republican side of the aisle, and one of the busiest of the potential Senate candidates at the moment is Richard C. Bozzuto, the minority leader of the State Senate. He has already made two trips to Washington for direct‐mail, fund-raising and endorsement advice from conservative professionals. But no sooner had the Watertown Republican arrived at a luncheon meeting last month with a group of Washington area conservative political action committees than Morton Blackwell, director of the Committee for Responsible Youth Policies, was brandishing a letter from James Althorn, of the Connecticut Conservative Union, criticizing Mr. tozzuto for a series of votes in the 1979 legislative session. The letter accused Mr. Bozzuto of trying to make “cheap political hay” out of such things as voting for the Governor's proposed budget increase, failing to back stricter curbs on abortions and voting against the appointment of Eva Hudak, a conservative, to the state Board of Education last March. “Althorn said I wasn't a true conservative because I voted against Mrs. Hudak,” Mr. Bozzuto said the other day. “But I consider my votes on these issues as libertarian and even as conservative. I guess it all depends on how you define it.” Mr. Bozzuto already has touched base with Senators Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, and Lowell P. Weicker Jr., Republican of Connecticut, whose brief Presidential fling earlier this year had Mr. Bozzuto's support. Senator Bozzuto was heading back to Washington this weekend to talk with Bill Brock, the Republican national chairman, and others. “I'm serious and I'm going after it,” said Mr. Bozzuto, who contended that he would inherit the conservative sup- port in the state if former Senator James L. Buckley of New York, who has a home in Sharon, did not run in Connecticut. • To the consternation of a few of the state's editorial writers and the Connecticut State Taxpayers Association, about 37 Connecticut legislators and staff members attended a meeting of the National Conference of State Legislators in San Francisco late last month. “Junkets should be paid for out of their individual expense monies, not from additional monies taken from the taxpayers,” said Marilyn Pearson, executive director of the taxpayer group, who estimated that the state would pay about $900 each for the trip. A state official concurred that her estimate was accurate. Legislators say such trips are useful to exchange ideas and information with lawmakers from other states, and this trip exposed the Connecticut delegation to at least three announced or unannounced Presidential candidates Senator Howard H. Baker Jr., Republican of Tennessee; former Texas Governor John Connally, a Republican, and Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, Democrat. Senator Baker, in a bipartisan mood, posed for pictures with the State Senate majority leader, Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of New Haven, and Senator Lawrence J. DeNardis, a New Haven Republican. After Governor Brown's speech against excessive government spending and nuclear proliferation, Senator Regina R. Smith, Democrat of Northford, remarked: “He was very cold. He didn't even smile once.” And after Mr. Connally's speech, Senator Eugene A. Skowronski, Democrat of Derby, said: “I think. we all ought to return to Connecticut and start campaigning against this guy. He's coming on strong.” Representatives of all three potential Presidential candidates worked the Connecticut delegation looking for help in setting up campaigns here later this year."
Changes Wrought by 60's Youth Linger in American Life,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/08/12/archives/changes-wrought-by-60s-youth-linger-in-american-life-after.html,"DES MOINES — In thousands of small, almost imperceptible ways, in the routine transactions of daily work, play and family life, Woodstock nation is alive in Des Moines. It is not altogether obvious here in Iowa or on the rest of the American scene. Gone, for the most part, are the more vivid signs of the national cultural and political changes that were symbolized by that extraordinary youth gathering at the Woodstock Festival in New York ‘State 10 years ago,lhis month. It was billed as a rock music concert, but, in the minds of many there, it was a victory celebration, the culmination of a decadelong youth crusade for a freer style of life, for peace and tolerance - a crusade rooted in such national forces as the civil rights and other movements of the time. For them, Woodstock marked ‘ rebellion against what was seen AS an old, repressive and corrupt order and the proclamation of a new order. The jeans with embroidered bell bot- toms and the beads have given way to jackets and ties and other more conserva- tive garb. The psychedelic rock of Jimi Hendrix, Sly and the Family Stone, and Jefferson Airplane has faded into the slick disco sounds of Donna Summer and the raucous rock of Kiss and Ted Nugent, And the radical politics spurred by the Vietnam War has mostly reverted to mote conventional politics, and even apathy. But if the political heat has dissipated, much of the openness that many people felt represented the countercultural era has lingered, despite suggestions by some that the nation is returning to the quiescent, more conformist 1950's. Much of what the counterculture produced has spread far from its point of origin on college campuses and filtered through all social classes. It has also left this Middle Western commercial center of 200,000 and thousands of other places across the country — different in many subtle but significant respects. Not everyone applauds the differences. Sociologists and historians who have monitored these changes generally agree that this country is today markedly different from .what it was in the 50's. They are not unanimous, however, about whether the changes are for the better. Some applaud the relaxed attitudes toward sexual freedom, drug use and unconventional behavior. But others with radical political sympathies dismiss the life‐style changes as superficial ones that have left economic and racial inequalities unremedied. And still others see weakening of the national moral fabric and a new cultural norm that deters those with traditional values from pursuing them. Anyone who doubts that things have changed should talk to Billie B. Wallace, the 53-year-old Chief of Police, who said that when the force hires new, young officers these days it accepts them if they assert that they no longer smoke marijuana. It's not that the chief has much sympathy for smoking dope; the police found that they could scarcely find any new recruits otherwise. Or, stroll through the offices of the once‐starchy Equitable Life Insurance Company of Iowa in its ornate tower on Locust Street, where beards, casual clothes and relaxed work habits are now the norm. Or, visit the Our Place discotheque on Walnut, where young homosexuals with influential positions in television, law enforcement, teaching and other professions openly dance together every weekend, sniffing butyl nitrite, a solvent that produces a rushing, throbbing sensation. Or, witness the extent to which women here, as elsewhere, have penetrated professions once largely closed to them. Feminist stirrings have even cropped up among farm women who inhabit the vast agricultural lands that stretch to eternity in all directions from Des Moines. Or, talk to landlords like Lee and Ruth Williams, both 46 years old, who no longer care much whether the couples they rent apartments to are married or not. Or, visit the Down Hbme Music Festival where a few thousand young people draped themselves over a cow pasture couple of weekends ago and anesthetized themselves with beer and marijuana. Among the revelers was a young man in faded jeans and a bandanna around his hair, obviously quite high; on Monday morning he returned to his job as an assistant county prosecutor. The spirit of Woodstock was quickly eroded by the economic recession that followed it in the 70's, which in some cases undermined the financial freedom that gave so many youths the where- withal to hitch around the country and at- tend rock festivals. They soon found themselves competing for scarce jobs and places in professional schools. And some found that middle‐class values were not as repugnant as they once thought. But still the youngsters of the Wood- stock generation are filtering into and al- tering the way of life of Des Moines. They are its young teachers, police officers, newspaper and television reporters, law- yers, business people and parents. While they have mostly shed the beads, long hair and political concerns of the 60's, they are bringing to their careers new at- titudes about sex, drugs, marriage and work that undoubtedly were shaped in part by their youthful experiences with the counterculture. In the process, they are altering the definition of news in the newsrooms, changing the character of police work and law enforcement, expanding the limits of acceptable language, gradually liberalizing business and work practices and bringing new priorities to the class- room. The changes should not be exaggerat- ed. Chief Wallace may be willing to hire former marijuana smokers as police- men, but not homosexuals. The Wil- liamses may rent to unmarried couples, but they would hesitate to take a racially mixed couple. And few people here would risk walking down the street openly smoking marijuana, as many do in New York and San Francisco. But throughout the country the older generation has made some accommodations. Interviews with young and old indicate that the much‐discussed generation gap has narrowed. “What we've got is an interpenetration of the generations; people find they are no longer so far apart,” said John R. Searle, a philosopher at the University of. California at Berkeley, who served on the President's Advisory Commission on Campus Unrest in 1970. “I am deeply struck by the fact that we now have great deal of tolerance for all kinds of life styles. There has been a terrific decline in political activity since the 60's, but an awful lot of the cultural changes are still with us.’ But ????? who had expecteu, or at least hoped for, an enduring political transformation to result from the new leftist movement that was intertwined with the counterculture are less impressed. Christopher Lasch, the social historian at the University of Rochester who is the author of “The New Narcissism,” agrees that young people have brought more social tolerance to American life. But, he adds, “I really do not think they are changing institutions.”’ “There are powerful economic coercions that cannot be altered simply by changes in life style,” he said, adding that even many of the cultural changes are misdirected. “Young teachers may smoke grass and talk wistfully about helping out, but education is deteriorating.” David Riesman, the Harvard sociologist, declares, not altogether approvingly, that “the counterculture has triumphed. ‘ He decries what he calls “the tyranny of enlightenment.” “It is marvelous to have relaxation of the older constraints from which Sinclair Lewis fled,” he said. “But in many places the newer values have such near‐total hegemony that people with older values are persecuted.” While Professor Riesman says he applauds the natural‐food and environmental movements, he feels that the counterculture has “seriously damaged” American intellectual life, high culture and national productivity. Others are more sympathetic about the residue of the 60's but uncertain about how durable it is. “I agree that the sensibilities of the 60's are being quasi-institutionalized,” said Bennett Berger, a sociologist at the University of California at San Diego who is the author of the forthcoming book on communes called “Ideological Work.” “But what that means in terms of consequences is problematical,” he added. “Exactly how these new sensibilities are making inroads in established institutions is hard to prove. People are struggling with contradictions between what's in their heads and what they've got to face.” The shift in values that Woodstock represented was resisted then and still is among those who saw it as an unraveling of the American moral fiber. Indeed, backlash of sorts is evident in the evangelical religious movement, in the political strength of the anti‐abortion drive, in the back-to-basics trend in education. Chief Wallace here attributes rising crime to the unwillingness of society to mete out “swift and sure” justice to young people. And Professor Riesman says that the only students properly prepared for college now are products of single‐sex parochial schools. Whatever the case, signs of change are everywhere. In the industrial, working class city of Pittsburgh, where there were only two bars for homosexuals in 1969, there are now a dozen, plus two churches and five activist groups catering to homosexuals. Natural‐food stores have sprouted from coast to coast, even in towns like Oskaloosa, Iowa; population 11,000. The national Safeway supermarket chain carries bean curd and alfalfa sprouts. And the use of marijuana is now commonplace among virtually all social strata in small towns and large cities. The police seldom make much effort to curtail it. Reflecting that, a New York Times / CBS News Poll taken last month found that 55 percent of the populace saw noth- ing wrong with premarital sex, well over double the number in a Gallup poll taken the month of the Woodstock Festival in 1969. And the proportion approving the full legalization of marijuana use has doubled from 12 to 25 percent of Ameri- cans in the last decade. The trends vary, of course, from place to place. The Woodstock period scarcely touched many rural towns or remote Ap- palachia. And even in sophisticated places such as New York and environs, many young people have never tried marijuana. But the effects, some subtle, some obvious, linger, and Des Moines, certainly not as liberal as New York or Boston but by no means” hick town, pro- vides as typical an example as any. Consider, for example, Jeff Hunter. The son of a wealthy developer and now 28, he tuned out and turned on 10 years ago. With long hair and beard, he dropped in and out of three colleges, trav- eled with a rock band, sold pretzels and mescaline on the streets of Bgston and bummed around Europe and North Afri- ca. Now he is back home in Des Moines and married. His hair is cut short and is receding, he wears a blazer and striped ties and prefers sipping Johnnie Walker Red to smoking Panama Red. Like his fa- ther, he is going into business, starting by learning how to manage the Hotel Fort Des Moines. But he insists that he is dif- ferent. “In my father's day, the buck was al- mighty,” he said. “I am much more con- cerned about how it is done. I take a lot of pride in this hotel. The aesthetics are im- portant to me. I think more about what impact this or that economic move will have on the community.” He hopes to re- store an ornate century‐old downtown of- fice building. But like so many young people, he finds that his liberal social sensibilities often clash with the responsibilities of work. He remembers with anguish the self-con- tempt he felt the day he shooed away a man going through the hotel's garbage. “What are you doing, Hunter?” he re- called saying to himself. Not far away Luther T. Hill, executive vice president of the Equitable insurance company, sits in his 18th‐floor office, the embodiment of the conservative Middle Western businessman with his short gray hair, gold‐watch fob and Harvard law de- gree on the wall. Yet he, too, was touched by Woodstock. “There was a day when no man would come to work here without a suit and tie,” he said, adding that they are rare now. “There was a time when beards were frowned on; now they are common. Also, young people are less willing to wait patiently for older employees to retire. There is much more movement. There was a time when we would not consider rehiring people who left; now we think they can be the best employees.” The younger generation has compelled even such a strict law-and-order man as Billie Wallace, the Chief of Police whose four children range in age from 22 to 29, to rethink things. Eight years ago one of his daughters brought home a boy with a full beard. “I'll never forget the first time she brought him home,” he said. “I looked at that beard and turned right off.” But the girl married the youth, and Mr. Wallace now considers him “one of the finest young men 1 know.” “He desensitized Billie Wallace on beards,” he said. His ideas about police work have changed, too. “We started ,very, very dogmatic in resisting drugs,” he said, whispering the word “drugs” in mock horror. “Prior to Vietnam we scratched any police applicant who admitted ever using marijuana. But we found that if we wanted any police recruits we had to modify that stance. ‘ One of the new breed of officers is George Simmer, 31, a tall, blond product of small‐town Iowa. Even though he never had much in common with the longhairs when growing up, he freely admitted in his police lie detector test that he had smoked marijuana sometimes. He says he does not any longer, but he frequently does not bother to make arrests for possession of small amounts, knowing there will usually be no prosecution. The professions are changing, too. Dwight M. Davis, superintendent of schools, says that young teachers today are more likely to want jobs teaching the poor and handicapped. “In the past teachers felt the best jobs were with high achievers,” he said. “Now many of our top young candidates feel more of a commitment to work with the disadvantaged.” Over at the newsroom of The Des Moines Register, the young reportorial staff has had its impact. “The atmos- phere around the newsroom is much more relaxed than when I started in 1970,” said Jim Healey, the newspaper's music critic. “Everybody was uptight about drugs then. Now the focus is not on those transgressions because the people writing about it are doing it. To them, that's not news anymore.” Indeed, the counterculture has seeped into corners of Des Moines society that would have shunned it a dozen years ago. Gerald Crawford is a 29-year-old lawyer who marched against the war in college. Now he dresses in dark suits, plays golf, drives a Mercedes and gambles in Las Vegas. He reports that at half the parties attended by professional people here about half the people will smoke mari- juana or snort cocaine, and few are shocked. Much of this has not been easy for insti- tutions like the church to accept, but it, too, is different now. Young Roman Catholic couples in Des Moines can find a sympathetic ear in the Rev. Frank Palm- er, the 43-year-old director of family life education for the diocese. He still be- lieves in the virtues of marriage and close‐knit family life, but he welcomes some of the changes wrought by the 60's: “We are not quite as sheltered as we were before. The whole 60's was a period of questioning of all the sacred cows, the schools, the churches, the government. That was good. I welcomed that. There is a lot of questioning still. We are coming to realize there are not as many absolutes as we thought there were.”"
Primary Challenges Spread in Suffolk,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/08/12/archives/long-island-weekly-primary-challenges-spread-in-suffolk-primary.html,"THE turmoil in the Suffolk Republican Party has spilled over into the Conservative Party, which is also confronted with primary for County Executive that is clearly an outgrowth of the Republican primary for that position. Indeed, some of the cast of characters are the same in both the Republican and Conservative primaries. The county Conservative organization has endorsed County Executive John V. N. Klein, the Republican incumbent, who faces a challenge in his own party primary from Peter F. Cohalan, the Islip Supervisor. But the treasurer of the Conservative organization, William A. Matthews of Patchogue, is challenging Mr. Klein's Conservative designation. Mr. Matthews said that Mr. Klein “does not reflect our conservative philosophy.” He said he and other Brookhaven Conservatives had warned the party's leadership months ago that Mr. Klein was unacceptable. “We had difficulty circulating his petitions four years ago,” Mr. Matthews said. The Conservatives’ county chairman, John Andrew Kay, views it differently. He declared that Mr. Matthews was sponsored by the Islip Republican leader, Anthony Pace, a major supporter of Mr. Cohalan. In retaliation, Mr. Kay has worked out a rare cross‐endorsement agreement with Islip Democrats to oppose Mr. Pace's County Legislature and town candidates. Mr. Kay also set up a confrontation with the new Right to Life Party when he charged that the party, which has declined to endorse Mr. Klein, is primarily interested in outpolling the Conservatives. The Republican and Conservative contests for Suffolk County Executive were viewed as the most significant ones since the passing of the deadline for filing petitions for primary candidacies. In Nassau County, peace generally prevails except for some perennial contests for city nominations among competing Democratic factions in Long Beach and Glen Cove. However, Joseph M. Margiotta, the Nassau County Republican chairman, touched off a skirmish last week with his plans to help Mr. Klein with some cross‐county fund‐raising. Mr. Cohalan said at his own fundraiser at Colonie Hill, in Hauppauge, that Mr. Margiotta “doesn't like it when people interfere in his county, and I deeply resent his intrusion in this county.” “There are enough political bosses and enough scandals and corruption in Suffolk County,” Mr. Cohalan said. He added that “we”re trying to clean it up and John Klein is trying to import more.” Although the County Executive contest is clearly the most visible and most significant, there are other prospective contests, including the following: The usually more combative Suffolk Democrats have more, if less significant, primaries. The party faces contests for county legislative nominations in six districts - the Fourth, Sixth, Ninth, 10th, 14th and 15th. None involve incumbents, but two of the seats are now held by Democrats, Martin J. Feldman in the 15th, who is running for County Executive, and Floyd S. Linton in the Fourth, who is not seeking re‐election. Thus, these two races are potentially significant for Democrats. The Democrats also have primaries for some town offices in Islip that the Republicans control, and in Huntington and Brookhaven, two towns that the Democrats control. 9Conservative candidates for the County Legislature in two districts, the First and the Fourth, who have Republican‐organization endorsement as part of the countywide Republican-Conservative agreement, face challenges in the primary from dissident Republicans. 9 Republicans in the 13th Legislative District in Babylon are battling for the nomination to succeed Joseph F. Bassano, the retiring Democratic legislator, in a contest that does not appear to have any connection with the countywide struggle, although the Babylon Republican organization is supporting Mr. Cohalan. But these conflicts are virtual sideshows for the main events in the County Executive contests. Normally, the Conservative primary would be of little importance outside the party, but it has taken on signifi- cance because Mr. Klein r Lai well need Conservative help to survi. s. The Conservative nomination woulc insure him a place on the ballot even if he lost the Republican primary and could provide up to 30,000 Conservative votes for him in the November election. In addition, control of both parties and future relations between them could be at stake. Mr. Kay, the Conservative chairman, raised that point and echoed the Klein line when he charged that Mr. Pace was trying to “take over the Republican and Conservative Parties.” He asserted that Pace workers had helped Mr. Matthews collect petitions to qualify for the ballot. He added that the move was an extension of an earlier “invasion” of the Islip Conservative Party by 266 Republicans who switched to the Conservatives within a short period last fall. “I'm convinced that Pace is the man behind the invasion,” said Mr. Kay, who had earlier accepted Mr. Pace's denials of any such motivation. That was before Mr. Matthews's candidacy, which threatens Mr. Kay's leadership as well as Mr. Klein's candidacy. Mr. Matthews said that he too opposed the “invasion” of the Islip Conservative Party by Republicans, although he did not know whether Mr. Pace had masterminded the move. Retaliating, the county Conservatives worked out the agreement with the Islip Democrats in which they endorsed two Democratic candidates for the County Legislature in the Eighth and Ninth Districts and three Democratic town candidates while the Democrats endorsed the Conservative candidate for town clerk. However, the antiKay faction of the Islip Conservative Party is challenging several of those endorsements in the Conservative primary. In addition, the Conservatives are running their own candidate for county sheriff, Harold Haar Jr., rather than endorsing the Republican incumbent, John P. Finnerty, who is an Islip Republican. Mr. Pace did not return telephone calls to give his version of the struggle with the Conservatives. Mr. Kay also sounded as if he were picking a fight with the Right to Life Party, although he had recently boasted of his close ties to that party's leadership. Anticipating that the Right to Life group would endorse either Mr. Cohalan or Mr. Matthews, Mr. Kay charged that the minor party leaders “claim to be purists, but all they want to do is play political games.” The Right to Life Party has rejected endorsement of Mr. Klein becauqe of his veto of a county legislative resolution calling for a halt to Medicaid financing of abortions. Mr. Klein contended that he had no choice, because of state law requiring such financing. ■"
Curb on Sales is Sought On Kit for Birth Defects,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/08/17/archives/curb-on-sales-is-sought-on-kit-for-birth-defects.html,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 16 (AP) — A consumer group urged the Government today to restrict the sale of a test kit for detecting serious birth defects in unborn infants, saying that improper use of the kit could lead frightened women to get unnecessary abortions. The Pub is Citizen Health Research Group, a consumer organization affiliated with Ralph Nader, argued that drug companies wanting to sell the kits should not be granted the unrestricted marketing privileges they seek. At issue is the method for marketing an “alpha‐fetoprotein reagent,” a laboratory test known as AFP. The test, now being performed at pilot projects in Boston and New York, is one step in determining whether a fetus is suffering from neural tube birth defects. The consumer group wants the kits made available only where follow‐up testing can be conducted to provide clearer proof of birth defects, where adequate information on the scope of the testing can be provided to women using it and where laboratory controls are stringent enough to minimize the chance of error."
CAPITAL REPORT,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/08/19/archives/new-jersey-weekly-capital-report.html,"GOVERNOR BYRNE seems to encounter hard luck when it comes to getting his picture in the papers — a flattering photograph, that is. During Mr. Byrne's first term in office, the Legislature was in a constant turmoil over his proposed state income tax, and there were near fist fights in the frequent all‐night sessions. At the height of the impasse, the news services circulated photographs of Mr. Byrne lolling alongside a swimming pool in New Orleans, where he was attending a governors’ conference. Two years ago, while friends and aides were moving heaven and earth to get Mr. Byrne re‐elected, he was caught by television and still cameras attending a baseball game at Yankee Stadium. It happened again last Sunday, when the Governor was in Las Vegas, Nev., to promote New Jersey on the Mike Douglas television show. This time, he was captured on film and television while attending a prize fight with Clifford S. Perlman, chairman of Caesars World Inc., which owns and operates the Boardwalk Regency, a hotel‐casino in Atlantic City. Mr. Perlman is under investigation by the state's Division of Gaming Enforcement because of reports that he has had business dealings with Meyer Lanky, the Miami crime boss. State law prohibits granting casino licenses to companies whose officers have mob connections. Caesars World is operating the Boardwalk Regency under a temporary permit. To ease the way for this permit, Mr. Perlman agreed to disassociate himself from the company until the charges against him have been resolved. Mr. Byrne's association with Mr. Perlman is sure to raise some questions about the seriousness of this investigation. Some cynics might view the Governor's socializing with Mr. Perlman as a signal that he wants the Caesars World inquiry to be soft‐pedaled. • Gubernatorial courtesy is still rampant in New Jersey. It has been the custom that, whenever the Legislature passes a bill, the measure will not be presented to the Governor until he calls for it. This gives the Governor tremendous leverage over the Legislature, since it effectively prevents the lawmakers from having a chance to override possible vetoes. As of last week, the Legislature had passed 140 major bills that Governor Byrne has not called for. Some were approved by the Legislature last year and are still in limbo. The State Constitution provides that a bill becomes law without the Governor's signature if he does not act on it within 10 days after it reaches his desk. The Governor has 45 days to act at the end of a session. The system works almost as well for legislators as it does for the Governor. They can push through bills for special interests and then depend on the Governor not to call them up. This enables the lawmakers to reward financial backers without actually giving them anything. • New Jersey motorists have been complaining about gasoline costing $1 a gallon. To ease the sting, it has been pointed out from time to time that, compared with the cost of gasoline in Europe, New Jerseyans are getting a bargain. Last month, the price was $2.25 a gallon in Italy, $2.22 in France, $2.10 in Engand $1.80 in West Germany. Now, along comes Assemblyman Anthony M. Villane, Republican of Eatontown, questioning the comparison. In the European countries, he said, more than half the cost of gasoline goes for taxes ($1.60 a gallon in Italy, $1.53 in France, 96 cents in England and $1.09 in Germany). The tax in New Jersey is 12 cents gallon, of which the state gets 8 cents and the Federal Government 4. Thus, commented Dr. Villane, who a dentist, New Jerseyans are paying more for gasoline than motorists abroad. He said he wished that state energy officials would stop comparing New Jersey prices with those in Europe. • New Jersey has had more than its share of sexually oriented disputes, including frequent clashes over homosexuality and abortion. The next big argument is likely to be over sex education in the public schools. Currently, the 611 functioning local school boards are allowed to decide sex education is to be taught, as well as how and in what grades. Because of various local pressures from parents and churches, sex education is offered to only about 40 percent of the state's 1.3 million public‐school pupils. All this may change soon. The State Board of Education has endorsed the principle of making sex education regular part of the curriculum in every school — from kindergarten through the 12th grade. Parents who object could have their children excused from the classes, which would be part of courses in personal health and hygiene. The program, if it is finally implemented, also would provide “appropriate services” for pregnant students and those with babies. An effort to stymie the sex‐education requirement is already under way in the Legislature. Assemblyman Daniel F. Newman, Democrat of Toms River, said that the Legislature had determined some years ago that sex education was a subject best left to local school officials and parents. Currently, the state requires only three subjects — English, history and physical education — to be taught in all schools. ■"
Issue and Debate Should Hospital Barring Abortions Get State Aid?,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/08/22/archives/issue-and-debate-should-hospital-barring-abortions-get-state-aid.html,"New York Medical College is performing abortions at Metropolitan Hospital Center as part of the medical services it provides at the municipal institution in East Harlem under an affiliation contract with New York City's Health and Hospitals Corporation. But under a contract that took effect July 1, the college intends to stop providing abortion services there as soon as the city establishes an alternative abortion service that would be financed directly by the Health and Hospitals Corporation and would presumably be staffed with outside physicians. According to Dr. Joseph A. Cimino, the college's president, the board of trustees “would feel more comfortable” if abortions at Metropolitan were performed by noncollege physicians hired by the city. The change in policy is attributed to a change in the board's membership. Last year the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York rescued the college from bankruptcy in exchange for being allowed to name 20 of the 30 members of a reconstituted board. Who Controls the College? While the archdiocese states that does not control the college, several trustees of the school insist that it does. New York Medical College has also just taken over the medical‐affiliation contract at another municipal hospital, Lincoln Hospital in the South Bronx. Abortions have not been performed at Lincoln because its medical services have been provided by Misericordia Hospital Medical Center, a Catholic hospital in the Bronx. Under the affiliation contract that took effect at Lincoln on July 1, Misericordia was supplanted by the medical college, which is following the policy established by Misericordia in refusing to provide abortion services. During recent hearings conducted by the Health and Hospitals Corporation, various organizations that support abortion contended that New York Medical College should forfeit its $24 million joint affiliation contract at Lincoln and Metropolitan Hospitals because of its refusal to perform abortions at one and its intention to stop providing them at the other. Moreover, the same groups contend that the 100‐year‐old college has compromised its nonsectarian status by allowing a religious conviction to dictate a medical policy. As a nonsectarian college, the college receives $2.25 million a year in state aid that, by law, cannot be given to a sectarian institution. The New York Medical College case has focused new attention on a longstanding question of whether an institution that prohibits or impedes abortions should receive state aid or public contracts. The Background Few issues have created more emotional upheaval than abortion, particularly since the United States Supreme Court ruled in 1973 that they were lawful, and public funds were appropriated to pay for them. In 1977, however, Congress restricted the use of Federal Medicaid funds for abortions to cases in which the life of the mother was threatened, or if the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest. The restriction is being challenged in Federal District Court in Brooklyn. In contrast, New York State has adopted regulations that provide state and local public funds for abortions whenever a physician stipulates that one is “medically necessary.” The Health and Hospitals Corporation, which operates the city's 17 municipal hospitals, has challenged the Federal restriction on the ground that it denies poor women a medical service. The Case Against State Aid Planned Parenthood of New York City argues that in accepting a contract from the city to provide medical services at a municipal hospital, New York Medical College “is obligated” to provide such services as abortion, contraception and sterilization. Alfred F. Moran, Planned Parenthood's executive director, said he had “no confidence” in the city's promise to provide alternative abortion services and that he would seek legal action if they were ‘impeded by the archdiocese. “On this issue there can be no compromise,” Mr. Moran said. The Citizens’ Committee for Children of New York, a voluntary child‐welfare organization, contends that the Catholic Church “has every right to design the services in its own hospitals to fit the beliefs and tenets of its religion.” But the committee says that Lincoln and Metropolitan Hospitals are public institutions. “If the archdiocese is unwilling to comply with established policy, with state and Federal laws, and is unwilling to recognize the rights of all patients, why does it wish to have New York Medical College involved in this affiliation contract? We are therefore opposed to any affiliation contract which denies safe abortion.” A spokesman for Clergy and Laity for Equal Abortion Rights says: “If the Catholic Church is going to get involved with affiliation contracts, then it must abide by the public policy that goes with them. Under the present circumstances, the medical college should not receive state aid and it should not have an affiliation contract with a public hospital.” The Case For State Aid Dr. Dorothy Harrison, deputy state commissioner of education in charge of state aid programs to medical colleges, says that she is “satisfied” that the medical college is nonsectarian despite its decision not to perform abortions. She also says, “We have no evidence that the college is under the control of the archdiocese.” Joan Allgaier, legislative director of New York State Right to Life, an organization opposed to abortion, says: “It seems to me that no medical school should be required by the state to do anything that it regards to be morally objectionable. I don't think the state has the right to interfere with the religious values of any institution.” Repeated efforts to elicit comment from an archdiocesan official were unsuccessful. Msgr. Eugene V. Clark, the director of communications for the archdiocese, said through a spokesman that the question posed by The New York Times — should an institution that prohibits abortions get state aid? — was “unfair” and “not worded correctly for a balanced debate.” Msgr. Anthony J. Bevilacqua, Chancellor of the Diocese of Brooklyn, strongly supports the college and the church's opposition to abortion. “It is obvious,” he said, “that the purpose and intent of withholding funds would be to coerce the church and its institutions into facilitating abortions and carry out actions contrary to their ethical and religious beliefs. Such coercion would be contrary to freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution.” Monsignor Bevilacqua said that conditioning the granting of funds to ‐. the performance of abortions would “in effect penalize the church and its institutions.” Speaking for the college, Dr. Cimino says that its joint‐affiliation contract does not even mention abortions and that any decision by the college not to perform them would “in no way” interfere with its capacity to fulfill its medical responsibility to the city. The Outlook On July 12, the board of directors of the Health and Hospitals Corporation approved a resolution “reaffirming” its policy to provide abortions “across the board” in municipal hospitals. Joseph C. Hoffman, the corporation's president, said he expected the medical college to monitor abortion services and family‐planning programs at both hospitals. He also said he expected that, “in most cases,” abortions would actually be performed by college‐affiliated physicians who would be paid separately by the corporation. He said that, if the college failed to provide such services, he would ask the corporation's board of directors to “consider rescinding the contract.” On the other hand, Dr. Cimino said he preferred to have abortions performed by physicians “who are not direct employees of the college.” Such critics as Planned Parenthood say they intend to watch the performance of the medical college at both hospitals. They contend, for example, that the college will not encourage its physicians to provide birth‐control services, much less refer patients for abortions. Monsignor Clark underscored the conflict in a recent statement in which he raised questions on whether any abortion service operated independently of the medical college could successfully coexist. “The Archdiocese of New York will never, through a contract or other means, cooperate with abortion,” he said, “nor will any of the agencies it controls ever do so.” “Neither the archdiocese nor Catholic doctors will willingly associate with those who encourage or practice abortion,” the monsignor asserted, even if “there seems to be no way to avoid physical contiguity with agencies and doctors who perform abortions.”"
2 Senators Ask Inquiry on Letter Assailing Their View on Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/08/23/archives/2-senators-ask-inquiry-on-letter-assailing-their-view-on-abortion.html,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 22 (AP) — Two Senators, labeled as “baby‐killers” in a mass mailing by a group opposing abortion, are supporting a call for an investi gation of the material by the United States Postal Service. Senators Birch Bayh, Democrat of Indiana, and George McGovern, Democrat of South Dakota, wrote the Postal Service earlier this summer, according to Mr. Bayh's press secretary, Jim Barrett. Their letter supports an investigation request from the National Abortion Rights Action League, Mr. Barrett said yesterday. The letter, circulated by a group called Americans for Life, was signed by Ohio State Senator Donald E. Lukens, and asks for contributions to a “$275,000 anti abortion political war chest.”"
Around the Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/08/23/archives/around-the-nation-robbery-trial-of-a-priest-to-continue-despite-2d.html,"WILMINGTON, Del., Aug. 22 (UPI) —A Delaware Superior Court judge decided today to continue the armed robbery trial of the Rev. Bernard T. Pagano, even though another man has admitted “involvement” in the robberies. The judge refused to say whether he would dismiss the charges when the trial resumes tomorrow. Judge Andrew Christie delivered his decision after a 45‐minute meeting between Judge Andrew Christie and defense and prosecuting attorneys. It was their second closed‐door meeting in as many days. Mr. Pagano, 53 years old, a Roman Catholic priest, was called into the meeting as it ended. His attorney, Carl Schnee, said he believed that charges against the priest would be dismissed and filed instead against Ronald W. Clouser, 39, of Brookhaven, Pa. Mr. Pagano's two‐week‐old trial on five counts of armed robbery, in which a total of $700 was stolen, plus one charge of attempted robbery, was halted abruptly when Mr. Clouser's attorney stood before Judge Christie to say that his client wanted to exonerate Mr. Pagano. He said that Mr. Pagano had been wrongly charged as the well‐dressed, courteous robber who police had nicknamed the “Gentleman Bandit.” But police, who spent the last two days trying to verify Mr. Clouser's involvement, indicated that they still believed that Mr. Pagano was the man who wielded a small silver handgun and demanded money from store clerks last winter. Most of a Model Ordinance Limiting Abortion Is Upheld AKRON, Ohio, Aug. 22 (AP) — Four provisions of Akron's restrictive abortion ordinance, which supporters say was used as a model by 11 states, were struck down today as unconstitutional. United States District Judge Leroy Contie Jr. upheld 15 other provisions. Defenders of abortion rights and prolife groups both claimed major victories, but an anti‐abortion group said that it planned an appeal. Among the provisions struck down was one requiring that minors obtain permission of a parent or guardian before undergoing an abortion. Among the provisions upheld is a 24‐hour cooling off period between the time when a woman consents to an abortion and the actual procedure. The ordinance, adopted in February 1978 by a 7‐6 vote of the Akron City Council, had never been implemented because of court challenges. Defense Finds a New Angle In Doctor's Murder Trial RALEIGH, N.C., Aug. 22 (AP) — Dr. Jeffrey MacDonald's attorneys asked today for testimony from a prison inmate who says that he accidentally telephoned the MacDonald home the night the doctor's family was slain and heard a woman and at least two men in the background. Dr. MacDonald, a 35‐year‐old former Green Beret physician now living in California, is charged with fatally stabbing and bludgeoning his wife and two daughters in 1970. He says that his family was killed by four hippies, one a woman who chanted, “Acid is groovy, kill the pigs.” The inmate, identified in court papers as Jimmy Friar, reportedly told a member of the defense team that he had tried to call his psychiatrist, who was also named MacDonald, between 1:30 A.M. and 3 A.M. on Feb. 17, 1970. That was about the time the family was killed. Defense attorneys quoted Mr. Friar as saying that he had gotten Jeffrey MacDonald's residence by mistake and that a woman answered. He reportedly said that she laughed when he asked for Dr. MacDonald. Mr. Friar also said that he had heard at least two men's voices in the background and that one had said, “Hang the damn phone up,” defense attorneys said. New Orleans Inmates Seize 2 Hostages, Including Priest NEW ORLEANS, Aug. 22 (UPI) —Two inmates took two hostages tonight in the chapel of Orleans Parish Prison and negotiated with the sheriff in an attempt to gain freedom. Ferdinand Barre, who played the guitar at prison church services, was released four hours after the incident began. But the other hostage, Ed Grice, a deacon who held services regularly at the prison, was still being held. Archbishop Philip M. Hannan joined dozens of other officials at the prison in an attempt to negotiate Mr. Grice's freedom. Sheriff Charles Foti led the talks. One inmate holding the hostages was identified as Leroy Menendez, 44 years old, who held a doctor hostage for four hours in July 1977. The other inmate was not identified. Long‐Term Study Proposed Of Effects of Worst Oil Spill CORPUS CHRISTI, Tex., Aug 22 (UPI) — The science officer of the team protecting the delicate Texas coastline from history's worst oil spill said today that a long‐term, multi‐million dollar study of the damage was being considered. “We just need to know after careful study just how dangerous a spill really is,” said Dr. John Robinson of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Dr. Robinson said that team members representing his agency, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Coast Guard and other agencies were preparing a proposal for a three‐year study of the extent of the damage from oil spewing from the runaway Ixtoc I well in Mexico's Bay of Campeche. Officials said that visible environmental damage so far had been limited to a dozen dead birds and the washup of tons of oil on the beaches of 113‐mile long Padre Island. The invisible damage — including impact on birds far at sea — remained under study."
The Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/08/26/archives/the-nation-cost-of-energy-remains-the-villain-on-the-price-front.html,"Prices rose an even 1 percent in July, an increase that can be taken with equanimity by only a few classes of people: those who hate messy fractions, and those who don't care to travel, use fuel or buy houses. For everyone else, the Consumer Price Index released last week confirmed the worst. Although food prices went up only moderately — meats and fish actually dropped 2.7 percent —and although clothing and upkeep costs continued to decline, the benefits were more than offset by rocketing prices for energy and other needs. The average for heating fuels rose 5.7 percent, bringing the increase over the last year to 40.2 percent. “Frustration is my reaction,” said William Cox, a top Commerce Department economist. With good reason: Energy costs are a prime villain in the spiral that threatens to shove the inflation rate to about 11 percent for the year. That will further reduce purchasing power, which has already fallen 3.9 percent in a year. What's more, the Index showed, energy prices are now pushing up transportation costs; and, together with inflation‐inspired higher interest rates, accelerating housing costs, 1.8 percent in July. Energy's central role in the country's economic difficulties was forcefully demonstrated by a United Auto Workers protest on Tuesday. Nearly a million workers shut down assembly lines long enough to sign postcards addressed to President Carter. The message: “I'm tired of being ripped off by the oil companies, OPEC and the lack of an energy program.” Selling Energy Plan And the President When a President starts acting as if he has his next election on his mind, he is almost always accused of neglecting the public's business. And in short order, the White House has to counter that those charges are unfair. Such was the case last week, as President Carter concluded a seven‐day handshaking excursion by riverboat down 659 miles of the Mississippi River. Despite appearances, his spokesmen insisted, Mr. Carter was selling his energy program last week, not himself. “There's absolutely nothing he could be doing. . .that would be more important,” his press secretary said. White House aides contended that the river bank crowds Mr. Carter attracted were proof that many Americans west of the Potomac think the President is worth cheering. (However, some skeptics argued that it might well have been mere curiosity that attracted thousands to the sight of Steamboat One going by.) Congress is not due back in Washington until after Labor Day, which could mark the start of a decisive phase in Mr. Carter's fight to hold on. So the President goes back on the road this week, with stops scheduled in Florida and Georgia. Dusting off a remnant of the less‐troubled early months of Mr. Carter's term — he called them “the good old days” last week — the White House announced that on Oct. 13 he would answer questions, live from the Oval Office, for two hours on National Public Radio. Talmadge Assets Top $3.5 Million Whatever the outcome of Senate disciplinary proceedings against him, Herman E. Talmadge apparently need not worry about lack of money. The Georgia Democrat reported last week that he earned more than $300,000 in 1978 and had a net worth somewhere between $3.5 million and $7.7 million. Mr. Talmadge has been accused of financial wrongdoing, including conversion of campaign and office funds to personal use, and the Senate ethics committee is expected to recommend some sort of action in his case next month. While the ethics panel was conducting its inquiry this summer, he received a two‐month extension on the personal financial statements required of all Senate members. Although last week's reckoning does not place Mr. Talmadge among the very wealthiest senators, it does list extensive outside income and assets, including 1,388 acres and a building in Lovejoy, Ga., worth at least $1.2 million, and other land and timber holdings. Last year, he took in interest, dividends and similar earnings amounting to at least $221,000, and $23,750 in speaking fees in addition to his regular Senate salary of $58,500. Model Abortion Law Gets Modifications A law calculated to discourage women from seeking legal abortions was adopted in Akron early last year, and the statute was so tough that antiabortion activists everywhere used it as a model. Similar laws have since been adopted in 11 other states, including Texas, Illinois and Maine. Last week, both the pros and the antis could claim some solace in a ruling, by Federal District Judge Leroy Contie Jr., upholding some provisions of the Akron ordinance and rejecting others as unconstitutional. The judge found no fault with some provisions, including requiring a doctor who has received a woman's permission to wait 24 hours before performing the abortion. That moved Marvin I. Weinberger, now executive director of a national antiabortion group and the former leader of an organiztion in Akron that pushed for the ordinance, to claim his side had won. But Judge Contie — whose ruling will be appealed — overturned sections of the law that required minors to obtain a signature of a parent or guardian before undergoing an abortion and mandate “humane” disposal of fetuses. An official of the American Civil Liberties Union called the ruling “a major victory not only for the women of Akron but for the women of the nation.” Last week, there were further signs that the political debate over abortions will be even more heated in the upcoming election year. United States Sentors Birch Bayh and George S. McGovern — termed “baby‐killers” in a mass mailing by an antiabortion group — said they supported a request that the United States Postal Service investigate the material because it was illegally misleading. Rafshoon Cleared In One Vote Inquiry While the political parties and the prospective candidates are gearing up for 1980, the Federal Election Commission is still trying to clear 1976 from its books. The commission last week announced it had decided (in a 4‐2 vote) there was “no reasonable cause” to believe President Carter's campaign committee got an illegal financial break from Gerald Rafshoon's advertising agency in the the last general election campaign. The commission said the agency had expected to recover in refunds from advertisers nearly $16,000 that was suspected to have been an in‐kind contribution to the Carter campaign. Mr. Rafshoon, now Mr. Carter's chief media strategist, sold the ad agency earlier this year. Another matter left over from 1976 — $645,000 in credit Mr. Rafshoon's agency extended to the Carter presidential primary campaign effort — is still being looked into by the Department of Justice. A Quick Brake On Nuclear Permits Presidential commissions so seldom make waves that “blue ribbon” often seems like a synonym for “rubber stamp.” The panel investigating the Three Mile Island nuclear accident, however, has turned out to be exactly what President Carter said it would be — independent and thorough — and perhaps a bit more. Last week, its members came down hard on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and forced a further delay in the licensing of new atomic power plants. The panel, headed by Dartmouth president John G. Kemeny, has feared that Three Mile Island was being regarded as only a temporary setback. Congress, despite much initial activity, has passed no nuclear moratorium bill. Mr. Carter has continued to stress the importance of atomic power. So when Harold R. Denton, director of the N.R.C.'s Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, announced last week that licensing procedures would be resumed, he got hit with something harder than a rubber stamp. Gov. Bruce Babbit of Arizona, expressing the feelings of many of the 12 members, said he was “personally outraged by your damn‐the‐torpedoes attitude” in proceeding before the panel filed its recommendations, due Oct. 25. The panel threatened to haul in the five commissioners of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, by subpoena if necessary; Mr. Denton quickly changed his mind. Even before that blow‐up, Dr. Kemeny said last week that testimony about the regulatory commission's reluctance to face safety issues suggested that “radical changes” might be necessary.

Abortion Bill: Debate On,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/08/26/archives/westchester-weekly-abortion-bill-debate-on-two-sides-on.html,"THE County Board of Legislators is considering a bill that would require doctors to notify in writing the parents of a minor seeking an abortion. Those for and against legal abortion differ as to whether the rule would be constitutional, but both sides agree that it will be passed if the committee now studying it reports it out for a vote. Robert D. McKeon, chairman pro tem of the county's Right to Life Party, the first new party formed in the state in 17 years, said that the “intent of the bill is to educate a gal before she undergoes an abortion” and to give her parents the opportunity to counsel her, hopefully in favor of continuing the pregnancy.” “Maybe they would throw her out, but maybe they wouldn't,” Mr. McKeon said. “But she won't know their reaction unless she gives them an opportunity. We think the risk is worth it, when you consider the alternative —to take a human life.” Polly Rothstein, director of the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion, said that she had “absolutely no doubt that in the long run the bill is never going to be law,” because “it's unconstitutional — the county doesn't have jurisdiction.” “If it's not knocked down at the legislative or executive level,” she said, “it certainly will be in the courts.” On its merits, she said, the bill should not be passed because “whenever you force a child to have a child it is wrong.” No one is trying to take away a pregnant girl's opportunity to consult her parents, Mrs. Rothstein said, but many girls “can't, won't or shouldn't” do that. The bill, which was introduced Aug. 6, has been referred to counsel by the county board's Committee on Legislation for an opinion on whether the county has jurisdiction on the matter. Among other opponents of the measure, the New York Civil Liberties Union contends that “the State Legislature has pre‐empted the area of abortion regulation.” Both Mr. McKeon and Mrs. Rothstein agree that, if the bill is reported out of committee for a vote by the full board, the tally would be 12 to 5 in favor — coincidentally or not, the 12 Roman Catholic members versus the five non‐Catholics. “We have the votes,” Mr. McKeon said. “Everybody knows that the vote will be 12 to 5.” He listed the opponents as Audrey G. Hochberg, Democrat of Scarsdale; Carolyn L. Whittle, Democrat of White Plains; Steven A. Galef, Democrat‐Independent of Ossining; Richard L. Brodsky, Democrat of Hartsdale, and Edward M. Gibbs, Republican‐Conservative of Peekskill. Mr. Gibbs is the chairman of the Committee on Legislation, which is in the process of collecting information and legal advice on the bill sponsored by John E. Hand, Republican of Yorktown Heights; John O'Leary, Republican‐Conservative of Yonkers, and James J. McPoland, Democrat of Yonkers. “There appears to be a very substantial mass of opinion,” Mr. Gibbs said. “It has always been my opinion that this is not a county matter and that we did not have legal standing. Maybe there are new facts. If so, and if we do have legal standing, then we would be making a report to the board. It's not going to happen in the next month.” The New York Civil Liberties Union has already concluded that it is not. In a letter to Mr. Gibbs, Donald L. Doernberg, chairman and legal director of the Westchester Civil Liberties Union, said: “It is clear beyond doubt that both the state and Federal courts have recognized and will continue to rule that the State Legislature has pre‐empted the area of abortion regulation. For a local legislature to seek to enact legislation in disregard of this principle is a clear violation of its public trust. It will inevitably subject the taxpayers to the cost of litigating an issue that cannot be won, and discussion of the bill wastes the time of the Legislature to boot.” “They read it the wrong way,” Mr. McKeon said “They keep talking about parental consent [as opposed to parental notification] and referring to court decisions not at all comparable to what we have here. A doctor would never treat a minor in any procedure, excepting an emertion should be any different.” The parental‐notification bill represents just the latest skirmish in the battle over abortion, a battle that more and more is taking on political overtones. Mr. McKeon said that the Right to Life Party, which last year won a line on the state ballot by getting 130,000 votes statewide, would have more than 80 major party candidates in about 175 races at various levels in the county this year and that he hoped to garner 5 percent of the total vote, an improvement on the more than 3 percent the party attained last year. “We want to test the line in every possible race we can,” Mr. McKeon said. The party has sent questionnaires to all candidates who asked for the party's ballot line and to every other candidate in a race where no major party candidate had requested it. It asks the candidate to sign a pledge of support for the party's goals — first, the passage of a constitutional amendment reversing the 1973 Supreme Court decision making abortion legal; second, the passage of a resolution by the State Legislature calling for a constitutional convention to consider the legal‐abortion issue and, third, the ratification of this amendment by the state once it has been proposed either by Congress or by a constitutional convention. More immediately, Mr. McKeon said, the party's goal next year is to unseat Senator Jacob K. Javits, as well as Representatives Peter A. Peyser and Richard L. Ottinger. If those candidates do not have opposition on the abortion issue from a major party, Mr. McKeon said, “someone will run on the Right to Life line.” Asked how many supporters the party had in the county, Mr. McKeon said: “If I could answer that, we'd be in big trouble because it wouldn't be nearly enough.” But he said that the party's newsletter had a circulation of about 8,000. “They have many letterheads and fewer people,” Mr. McKeon said of his opposition, “and we have fewer letterheads and many people.” A resident of Yonkers, Mr. McKeon is married and has six children. He works for a large corporation in the area, which, for reasons of privacy, he declined to identify. He declined to be photographed and said that his age was “not pertinent.” Mrs. Rothstein, who lives in Port Chester, is married to a patent lawyer and has a teen‐age daughter and son. She is 42 years old “and getting grayer” and has a master's degree in human sexuality from Columbia University Teachers College. “I'm bored — I hate it,” she said of her abortion‐rights work. “It's an old issue. It's not a legislative issue. But I have to do it. I'm a political prisoner.” The political activities of the Right to Life Party, she said, are “to our benefit.” “Single‐issue parties of fanatical membership traditionally go nowhere,” she added. “Their ballot is like a red flag. It will let people know who supports ‘right to life’ philosophy, which is not the mainstream of American thought.” Should those who favor a right to legal abortion worry about the Right to Life movement? “I think that we all have to worry, yes,” Mrs. Rothstein said. “The reason is that politicians are very fearful people, and many will succumb to the demands of a fanatical minority who will vote on only one issue.” She said that she “couldn't begin to estimate” the number of activists favoring legal abortion, but said that the coalition had a mailing list of about 4,000, 1,500 of whom were on an “alert list — people who have said they will do something.” The coalition for abortion rights also has a political‐action committee, which, by law, is a financially separate entity. The political committee, Mrs. Rothstein said, “will be raising money for pro‐choice candidates and helping others with staff, volunteers — all of the basic political tools anybody will use.” Aside from the Right to Life Party, the major effort of the Right to Life Coalition of Lower Westchester is educational, according to its chairman, Elizabeth Costanzo, a 47‐year‐old former mathematics teacher and mother of three from Hastings‐on‐Hudson. This, she said, consists primarily of making slide presentations to schools, colleges and civic organizations “showing that life is present at fertilization and to show the development of that life and then to show how abortion destroys life.” Members also picket an abortion clinic in Dobbs Ferry about once a month, hoping to persuade patients to change their minds. The coalition sponsors a fund‐raising dinner‐dance in the spring and sends a delegation to Washington every January to march in protest of the Supreme Court decision making abortion legal. “Our ultimate goal,” Mrs. Costanzo said, “is to amend the Constitution to protect life from fertilization to natural death.” Another organization that describes itself as opposed to legal abortion is the Pregnancy Care Center, also known as Birthright. With centers in Yonkers and Mamaroneck, it offers counseling to women who want to continue their pregnancies. Affiliated with Birthright International, which was founded in Toronto in 1968, the Pregnancy Care Center was started in Westchester in 1974 by Elinor Martin of Yonkers because “there didn't seem to be any information for girls who did not want abortions but did not know where to go.” The center is in the process of changing its name for a better definition of its function and to avoid being confused with the Right to Life Party. In addition to providing counseling on a range of pregnancy‐related issues, the center places women in private homes for the last few months of their pregnancy in cases where the woman or her family feel that it would be too awkward for her to remain at home. After that, said Mrs. Martin, the 52year‐old wife of a dentist and mother of two grown sons, the woman “can go back to her neighborhood.” Among other organizations in the county favoring legal abortion, one, the Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights, seeks as one of its primary ob jectives to “raise the consciousness of people to the religious perspective on the abortion issue,” according to Sandy Kelley, coordinator of the New York Metropolitan Area chapter. “People have just begun to realize that 35 million Americans are in denominations that have very strong prochoice positions,” she said. These denominations, she said, include the Episcopalians, Presbyterians, United Church of Christ, the Reformed Synagogue, Unitarians, United Methodists and the American Baptists. Another group that favors legal abortion, Planned Parenthood, is a tax‐exempt organization and as such is prohibited from getting involved in political activities. But it works with other local organizations “to protect contraception and abortion rights for all women, regardless of age or income,” according to a brochure. It regards the bill as “absolutely unconstitutional and detrimental to the best interest of the young people of Westchester,” according to Francine S. Stein, the executive director of the organization's Westchester chapter. “Parental‐consent and parental‐notification requirements threaten the health and safety of young people by causing delay in seeking medical help,” she said. Planned Parenthood is on the steering committee for Abortion Rights Action Week, a nationally coordinated series of local events in support of abortion rights scheduled for Oct. 22‐29. The Westchester Medical Committee for Abortion Rights is another organization that supports legal abortion. According to Dr. Clarence E. Woodward, its chairman, the group has about 200 doctors in the county who have agreed to write to legislators on abortion issues, lobby for abortion rights within medical societies and make available legal‐abortion literature in their offices. The committee opposes the bill before the legislators on several grounds, among them, that it “would violate the confidentiality of the doctor‐patient relationship by mandating that the physician notify the parents of a patient who requests that she not be involved,” and that “the county should not be in a position of dictating medical policy to physicians.” The National Organization for Women, which concentrates on legislative developments concerning abortion also supports legal abortion. Zelle Andrews, a past president of the Westchester chapter, who is on the national board, said that NOW was involved in monitoring the State Legislature on this issue and that since the parentalnotification bill has come up before the County Legislature, “we'll have to be attentive to that.” Another group favoring legal abortion, Catholics for a Free Choice, has about 500 members statewide, according to Jenny Rose Lifrieri, president of the New York State chapter. Its position is that “everybody should make decisions on abortion and contraception in accordance with one's conscience, as opposed to the position of the Roman Catholic hierarchy, which will not only not allow Catholic married couples to make these decisions in accordance with their own consciences, but now seeks to impose its will on all American couples,” according to Miss Lifrieri. Miss Lifrieri said that the major activity of the group was contacting legislators “so that it becomes visible that the church is not a monolith.” “We represent the majority of Roman Catholics,” she said, “particularly women — and women are used to being silent in church. We were trained that way.”"
Canadians Learn About ‘Flora Power’,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/08/26/archives/canadians-learn-about-flora-power-outside-normal-channels.html,"OTTAWA — Once upon a time a long time ago, a young red‐haired woman from Nova Scotia checked her suitcase at the railroad station here and began to look for a job as a secretary. Because she liked to travel, her first stop was the Ministry for External Affairs. She was not hired. Now, 22 years later, Flora Isabel MacDonald has returned to External Affairs, but not as a secretary. She is the boss, the Minister for External Affairs, the first woman to hold that job in Canada. Miss MacDonald is also the highest‐ranking woman ever in Canadian politics. A 53‐year‐ld high school dropout and Canadian nationalist who hitchhiked across her country one year to learn its wonders for herself, she finds politics field in which she can combine her love of travel with the persontoperson contact, maneuverings and minutiae that fill the days of those in public office. “My job is my life,” she says. Since 1972, Miss MacDonald has been the Conservative member of Parliament from Kingston, Ont., the St. Lawrence River city represented for so many years by John A. Macdonald, Canada's first Prime Minister and no relation. Outside Normal Channels Just three years ago, soon after Margaret Thatcher won the leadership of Britain's Conservative Party, Miss MacDonald made her own bid at a leadership convention, seeking to become head of Canada's opposition party, the Progressive Conservatives. Her campaign circumvented her stolid party's normal channels, relying heavily on individual contributions and volunteer work. “FLORA POWER,” the lapel buttons screamed. But it wasn't enough. And after the second ballot, as her totals dwindled, Miss MacDonald, smiling broadly as ever in contrast to the tear‐streaked faces of some male competitors, dramatically led her followers across the convention hall to side with a political unknown named Joe Clark. When Mr. Clark became Prime Minister, he moved immediately to name Miss MacDonald Foreign Minister, the only woman in his cabinet. She presides over the 105 embassies, the 750 professional diplomats and the 1,500 support personnel in Canada's foreign service. Typically, within hours of her appointment she was at the External Affairs building, meeting her new aides and employes. Among her first questions: Would anyone mind if she jogged to work? The answer: Join the crowd. In her first three months as Foreign Minister, traditionally a position of low domestic visibility in Canada, Miss MacDonald has impressed many professional diplomats as a calm quickstudy, a loyal cabinet member and an eloquent domestic spokesman for foreign affairs. She also played a prominent role in prompting Canada to accept greatly increased numbers of Indochinese refugees. An Experienced Organizer The new minister has excellent nationwide contacts for this job, built up over two decades of political organizing for the Conservatives, whose party headquarters was the second — and final — stop on her job‐hunting expedition 22 years ago. “She's a very savvy lady,” said one old Ottawa hand, “and tough too.” The second of six children and the daughter of a telegraph operator, Miss MacDonald was born June 3, 1926, in North Sydney, Nova Scotia, a spectacularly scenic region where money and jobs have never been in excess. Leaving high school in the 11th grade, Miss MacDonald attended Empire Business College and worked as a bank teller before wending her way across Canada and Europe, stopping to work as her funds ran out. Once in politics she rose quickly, effectively using her charm, outgoing personality and organizational skills in dozens of national and local elections. In 1966, however, she became entangled in an interparty leadership struggle and was dismissed for “disloyalty” by John Diefenbaker, then leader of Canada's conservative party, now called the Progressive Conservatives. She spent the next six years in the political science department of Queens University in Kingston and as executive director of the Committee for an Independent Canada, a nationalist group deeply concerned about United States economic penetration. Foreign Minister Flora MacDonald is the highest ranking woman ever in Canadian politics. In 1971 she became the first woman to attend Canada's National Defense College, and was officially declared man so that, wearing a pants suit, she could enter the officers’ mess. She once threatened to title some future book, “Abroad With 90 Men.” Politically, Miss MacDonald, who says she married politics instead of a man, is known as a “red Tory,” a member of her old party's progressive wing, which appears to have the most influence in Mr. Clark's cabinet. A party stalwart in demand for her warm speeches at political functions across this land, Miss MacDonald has a reputation for breaking with her party on some “people‐oriented” issues she feels strongly about. These include opposing capital punishment and favoring abortion clinics. But even in delicate situations, Miss MacDonald has shown a kind of steely aplomb that emerged not long ago at a public debate involving all the candidates in her district. One of her supporters, obviously intoxicated, was such a persistent heckler of the other candidates that they had difficulty speaking a complete sentence. Audience members openly fidgeted in their seats, but no one wanted the fight that was sure to ensue if someone tried to eject the boisterous booster. Seizing the moment, Miss MacDonald, smiling as ever, climbed down from the stage, greeted her supporter and, wrapping her arm around his shoulders, charmed him from the auditorium through earnest discussion. He didn't return. But she did — to applause."
"Mrs. Thatcher Divides Feminists: A Woman in Power, but Not ‘a Sister’",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/08/27/archives/mrs-thatcher-divides-feminists-a-woman-in-power-but-not-a-sister.html,"LONDON, Aug. 26 — The British feminist movement is engaged in a bitter debate over what some of its members regard as a momentous triumph, the election of a woman as Prime Minister. On one side of the argument there are those such as Mary Stott, a writer and longtime campaigner for women's rights, who thinks that Margaret Thatcher's coming to power “has done incalculable good, because it means we have conquered the credibility gap and proved that a woman can become Prime Minister.” But the women on the other side are more disturbed by Prime Minister Thatcher's staunch conservatism than they are pleased about her sex, and they are distressed that she does not seem to pay much attention to feminism. In the words of Eileen Fairweather, an editor at the country's leading feminist magazine, “Mrs. Thatcher is a woman, but she certainly isn't a sister.” The magazine, which is called Spare Rib, campaigned hard against Mrs. Thatcher, and since the election last May it has sharply criticized the conservative new course that she is charting for Britain, with substantial cuts in public spending and reduced Government involvement in business and social services. Called ‘Totally Negative’ “Her approach and her effect are totally negative,” said Miss Fairweather, “and the fact that she is a woman is irrelevant, or actually bad.” Other Britons have noted that although Mrs. Thatcher has proved herself very easy to love or to hate, with clear‐cut, decisive actions on Zimbabwe Rhodesia, taxes and trade unions, very little of the loving or hating is done in terms of her sex. “Isn't that the whole point of what we were trying to achieve?” a young woman asked at a recent London dinner party, where the issue was being debated vociferously. “Maggie is vilified or adored, like Churchill or Carter or anyone, but not in terms of her being a woman. That's just the way it should be.” Nevertheless, for many British women, the election here of the first woman to head a major Western government has presented a harsh quandary. Fay Weldon, a popular feminist novelist, says that because of her strong opposition to Prime Minster Thatcher's politics, “we ‘don't even mention her name around our house any more.” Every Little Girl Now Knows “But still,” she adds, “it is certainly true that every little girl in school knows now — as she did not know a year ago that she can aspire to being the Prime Minister, that to be a woman is not necessarily to be second rate, and that's wonderful.” Mrs. Thatcher has rarely said much one way or the other on the subject of feminism. When asked about it during the campaign, she alienated some women by saying: “I did not get here by being some strident female. I do not like strident females. I reckon if you get anywhere, it's because of your ability as a person and not because of your sex.” Since taking office, she has alienated them still further with such official actions as appointing an all‐male Cabinet and indicating that the law might be changed to make abortions more difficult to obtain. Moreover, Mrs. Thatcher's opponents think that many of the expected cuts in Government spending will affect women. The Government has not said just where it plans to cut back, but Spare Rib Magazine, taking the darkest viewpoint, recently envisioned wholesale reductions in social services, and protested: “It is we who have to stay at home to care for the elderly and disabled, we who have to give up work when the nurseries close. How much worse it is to know that a woman is presiding over the carnage.” Other women argue, though, that simply having a woman at the top raises people's consciousness about women's rights. “There is certain to be a big effort to get more women into Parliament at the next election,” a political party worker said. There are only 19 women among the 635 members of the House of Commons. Similarly, the embarrassing fact that under the present tax law, Mrs. Thatcher's husband, Denis, a retired businessman, could be legally responsible for the completion of the Prime Minister's tax return, might bring about a change in that feature of the law, which many women find objectionable. According to people who deal regularly with Prime Minister Thatcher, the fact of her being a woman is ignored more often these days, in the rush of day‐to‐day affairs. In Parliament, former Prime Minister James Callaghan and his colleagues on the Labor side of the House are considerably less likely to refer to her with such patronizing titles as “the dear and lovely lady” than they were before she and her Conservative Party defeated them. Denis Sat With the Wives At the recent conference of leaders of Commonwealth nations in Zambia —where Mr. Thatcher sat with the wives on opening day, and another famous husband, Prince Philip, went off to make a speech about rhinoceroses while his wife did her official duties — the Africans frequently referred to Mrs. Thatcher as “a good lady” or “an iron lady,” and she danced a celebrated turn with President Kenneth D. Kaunda. But she was the center of attention at the conference most of the time not because of her sex, but because of the significant initiative that Britain took there on Zimbabwe Rhodesia. “That kind of thing will happen more and more often, I predict,” said an official of the Fawcett Society, a feminist organization here. “People will forget all about the novelty of her being a woman, and then, when it comes time for the election of Britain's second woman prime minister, why, there won't be much of a fuss about it one way or the other.”"

Personal Health,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/08/29/archives/personal-health-muscular-dystrophy-cure-is-still-sought.html,"BETWEEN 9 P.M. Sunday and 6:30 P.M. Monday, some 90 million people will tune in to what has become a Labor Day institution—the Jerry Lewis Telethon. Its purpose is to raise money for the Muscular Dystrophy Association to combat a devastating group of poorly understood diseases for which there are as yet no cures. More than half the money raised — the figure last year exceeded $29 million, half the association's total funds — will be spent on services to patients and their families, much of it administered through 214 free clinics across the country. More than a quarter will go to support research into the mysteries of 38 different neuromuscular diseases that afflict some 200,000 Americans, often causing progressive crippling and premature death. The association supports 10 research centers, including ones at Columbia University, New York University, the Mayo Clinic and the University of California at Los Angeles. Additional research money goes to hundreds of researchers here and abroad. The association was started in 1950 by a handful of patients, physicians and parents of children with muscular dystrophy who were determined that some treatment be found for the relentless disease that would confine the youngsters to wheelchairs before their teen‐age years and probably claim their lives before they reached adulthood. In addition to diseases that affect only the muscles, the group's activities include disorders of the nerves that control muscle function, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease), and diseases that affect the junction of nerves and muscles, such as myasthenia gravis. The disease from which the association takes its name is really not one but rather a group of inherited ailments that have one thing in common — progressive weakening and degeneration of muscle fibers. There is no known involvement of the nervous system, and although there are several theories, no one yet knows exactly what happens to cause the muscles to disintegrate. The rate of progression, the way the disease spreads and the chances of living a full life span vary with the different types of dystrophy. Unfortunately, the most common form of muscular dystrophy, called Duchenne dystrophy, is also the most devastating. Usually inherited by boys from their mothers, who themselves do not have the disease, it starts in the preschool years. The child learns to walk, but soon develops a waddling gait, walks on his toes and falls frequently. As the disease progresses, it becomes increasingly difficult for the child to stand up or walk. A wheelchair becomes necessary by the age of 12, and the muscle wasting spreads to other parts of the body. Death commonly occurs before 20, often the result a respiratory infection that the breathing muscles were too weak to combat. Children with Duchenne dystrophy often have deceptively sturdy‐looking legs. This results from the enlargement of muscle fibers and their replacement with fatty deposits, which are of no use in supporting the body. Duchenne dystrophy afflicts between 20 and 30 of every 100,000 boys born. In most cases, the genetic defect responsible for the disease is passed from mother to son on the sex, or X, chromosome. The mother is a carrier of the dystrophic gene; she has another X chromosome without the harmful gene and so does not develop the disease herself. But there's a 50‐50 chance that she'll pass on the gene her children. A boy, who receives a Y chromosome from his father that pairs with the X, has no gene to override the influence of the dystrophic gene from his mother. This type of inheritance is called sex‐linked recessive. The mother can also pass on the dystrophic gene to a daughter, but the girl, who gets a healthy chromosome from her father, would then become a carrier like the mother, not a victim of the disease. One of the most hopeful aspects of Duchenne dystrophy is the ability through a blood test for certain enzymes to identify about 70 percent of women who carry the dystrophic gene. Researchers are working on a method to identify through a sampling of fetal blood those unborn boys who are afflicted with the disease, so that their birth might be prevented through abortion. An unknown number of cases, perhaps as many as a third, are not inherited in the usual fashion, although they too are caused by a genetic error. Instead of being carried by the mother, the genetic defect arises spontaneously in the child. Among other less common forms of muscular dystrophy are the following: ¶ Limb‐girdle muscular dystrophy, which usually strikes older children or adults in their 20's or 30's and affects both males and females. It is also inherited as a recessive trait, but in this case, dystrophic genes from both the mother and the father cause the illness. If both parents carry the gene, each child has a 25 percent chance of inheriting the disease. The muscles initially affected may be in the pelvic region or the shoulder area, but eventually both are involved. ¶ Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy, which involves the facial as well as the shoulder area muscles. It usually starts in adolescence and progresses at variable rates throughout life. Victims have a normal life expectancy. The disease is inherited as a dominant trait — only one gene is needed to cause it and that gene can come from either the mother or the father. In this case, a boy or girl has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the disease if either parent has it. Many dozens of drugs and other therapies have been tried through the years to halt or reverse the progression of muscular dystrophy, and the Muscular Dystrophy Association has an extensive drug screening program to search for new possibilities. But no modern miracle has yet been discovered. Meanwhile, persons afflicted with muscular dystrophy can be given exercises that delay incapacitation, and when confinement to a wheelchair seems unavoidable, surgery may be done to relieve some of the crippling that makes walking impossible. Splints and braces may also be used. For victims of the various neuromuscular diseases and their families, the association provides all its services free. These include diagnostic examinations, follow‐up medical care, carrier detection, genetic and psychological counseling, orthopedic aids like wheelchairs, braces and lifts, physical and occupational therapy, recreational activities, camp programs and transportation.

Hers,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/08/30/archives/hers.html,"I'VE known Janna since we were both 10 years old and in the Girl Scouts in Minnesota. Later, we spent summer vacations together canoeing and making lists of clever conversational openings to use on boys. In high school we spoke French to each other on the phone, so our mothers couldn't understand. We roomed together for the first year of college, sharing mohair sweaters that we thought were sexy and likely to lure men to the table in the student union where we squandered afternoons over lemonade and Twinkies. Then Janna flunked out — primarily because she rarely got out of bed to attend classes — and I transferred to Berkeley. After college, I moved to New York and Janna sailed for Europe to seek her fortune. Our paths separated for 16 years, but periodically she would reappear in my life like a sudden, brief electric storm. No one can make an entrance like Janna. • • • Although she was usually earning about $100 a week as a secretary to one foreign film star or another in Rome, Janna would arrive accompanied by 20 pieces of luggage, several furs, a small dog or two and my overburdened and angry doorman. “Tip the man,” she would command, in accents that never came from Minnesota. Once, four of our fellow classmates from high school, then living in New York, gathered at the Russian Tea Room for one of our rare reunions. Janna strode through the door carrying a huge cake she had brought all the way to New York from Malibu Beach, made in the shape of a female torso with two mountainous breasts, iced with a polka‐dotted bikini. It was intended as a birthday surprise for two of us “girls.” The Russian Tea Room staff was agog. We drab sparrows agreed that we needed Janna and her periodic visits to comfort us with the thought that somewhere out there she was doing decadent, glamorous things. Even before the glossy magazines, Janna told us all about angel dust, piña coladas and homosexual orgies. We collected her unintentional one‐liners: “Never send your Puccis to the dry cleaner in Yugoslavia,” she would warn us. “Never share a flat with a Communist, because she'll wear your clothes without asking.” “Never have an abortion on the island of Sardinia.” While Janna eked out a living in Rome by translating scripts, being a go‐fer to various actors and typing on a part‐time basis, she always felt that the key to her fortune was just around the corner. If it wasn't breeding Shih Tzu dogs to sell to the Roman movie colony, it was decorating straw hats, opening a public relations firm, selling insurance, designing dresses or writing a blockbuster movie script. She plunged from one enthusiasm to another, meanwhile filling her apartment with dogs and odd hangers‐on. Janna went through men the same way, managing to juggle, for instance, a Greek Communist artist, a middle‐aged American actor and an Italian thug all at the same time. But through all the years and lovers, none turned out to be the prince her mother had always promised would come. A few months ago, I got a letter from Janna, now 38, announcing that she was six months pregnant. Typically, she began with a discussion of some best sellers she had been reading and the state of the stock market. Then she wrote: “I've decided that if I'm ever going to have a baby, the time is now.” She said she had selected an out-of-work actor living half the world away in California as the person with whom she would like to share the “experience of parenthood.” “There's no question of marriage,” she added, “but he has agreed to contribute financially.” According to the amniocentesis test, she was carrying a girl, and she was mulling over names from various operas, looking for something “glamorous, mysterious, exciting.” I know several women who I often thought would make excellent single parents, because they love children and are financially independent. But I had never imagined Janna — the free spirit — as a moth- Janna, a blithe spirit seeking her fortune. er. I called her at once and tried to sound tough and practical without being outright condemning. Did she have the actor's offer of financial help in writing? Did she have a regular job? Did she have a decent place to live after the baby was born? The answer to all three questions was no, but Janna was unconcerned and chattered on about prams and natural childbirth lessons and nursemaids. I put together a stack of old baby clothes, stuffed them into a used infant seat, wrapped the whole thing in a baby blanket and sent it off with one of Janna's old admirers who was going to Rome. “These things happen,” he shrugged. “She planned it that way,” I replied. He clearly didn't believe me. About a month ago I received a handmade pink birth announcement with a photograph of a beautiful baby girl, Aida Isolde, in a white crocheted dress, propped against chic, ruffled calico pillows. The next A day brought a harrowing letter about a two-day-long labor due to “old muscles,” a homecoming to an empty apartment (the hired Italian nursemaid never showed up) and the onset of a high fever. Again I rushed to the telephone. My own homecoming from the hospital with a new baby was always a signal for depression, exhaustion, fits of crying. What must Janna be going through alone, sick, not even knowing how to change a diaper? And what kind of life will Aida have, tagging along in Janna's unstructured, hedonistic existence? On the long‐distance connection, Janna's voice sounded as upbeat as ever, but something had subtly changed. She had recovered from her fever, she said. And she had found a nursemaid she liked. “She's very strict and keeps the baby on a schedule,” Janna explained. “But I've got to change my pediatrician. The one I have is in favor of demand feeding whenever the baby cries and wants me to breast feed for a minimum of six months. Six months! I've got to get back to work full time! I'm planning the church baptism for Easter . . . do you think you can come?” I hung up the telephone, astonished. Strict feeding schedules? Back to work? Church baptism? In my circle of new mothers, we were all into demand feeding, La Leche and permissiveness and Janna was sounding like a voice from our mothers’ Calvinist, work‐ethic pasts. I was relieved that she seemed to have everything so well under control but, to tell the truth, there was a sense of loss, too. I had the feeling that my blithe spirit had flown. • • The Hers column was designed as a forum for women writers.

WESTCHESTER JOURNAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/02/archives/westchester-weekly-westchester-journal-another-term-for-delbello.html,"WILL County Executive Alfred B. DelBello run for another term? “I don't know,” he said, after an aide needed to remind him that his current term expires in 1981. “I do know,” he added, “that there are local, state and national problems, and if you're running a local government you have to deal with all of them. We spend a great deal of time at the state or Federal level trying to change things that should be changed. “Whether I ever run for another office or not I don't know.” Incongruously, a recent indication of support for a DelBello‐for‐Senate race came when Samuel G. Fredman announced that he would not seek re‐election as the Democratic County Chairman, in part because he did not have enough “imput” with Mr. DelBello. “Nothing I say about his not being a party person detracts from the kind of administrator he is,” Mr. Fredman said. He said he thought that although Bess Myerson was the frontrunner in the Democratic race, Mr. DelBello was “not only a logical Democratic choice, but I believe the most apt person” in the party to beat Senator Jacob K. Javits or Representative Jack F. Kemp of Erie County, “whichever is the Republican candidate. I'd be willing to lend the prestige of my office to bringing together a group of people and try to raise some seed money.” Speaking of political futures, how did the County Executive feel about President Carter? “Lately?” He asked, smiling. “I've been a historic supporter of Carter's. There are a few things he has to straighten out, though.” What would those be? “That's a long story,” said the County Executive. Could he make it brief? “His major problem right now,” Mr. DelBello said finally, “and he hasn't followed through on this, is the energy issue. People are willing to accept inflation to a limited degree, but fueloil uncertainty they're not willing to accept. And he's running out of time.” Had he been asked to endorse the President? “No.” Suppose Hamilton Jordan, Mr. Carter's chief of staff, were to call tomorrow and say, “We're putting together a committee to support the President.” What would he say? “I'd say,” said Mr. DelBello, “I'd have to call him back.” It was a glimpse into the inner workings of politics, a well‐attended night meeting of the Westchester Democratic Executive Committee. About 50 people were jammed into a stuffy room on the second floor of an old building at Mamaroneck and Martine Avenues in the heart of White Plains. The principal subject was Mr. Fredman, the County Chairman, and his plan to leave the job when his term expires on Sept. 26 because of problems with Mr. DelBello and with Democratic county legislators, other elected officials and members of his own organization. Some of the reasons for his decision, Mr. Fredman told the group, were that he was not being consulted by Mr. DelBello, nor was Mr. DelBello going through his office in making appointments. He said he lacked “input” into county government, and the seven Democratic legislators, he complained, represented “eight points of view.” Some local party officials were doing end runs around his office in taking problems directly to the county administration. On his problems with Mr. DelBello, whom he consistently praised as an administrator, Mr. Fredman declared: “I wanted input. I never wanted the power to tell him what to do:” At the outset, perhaps to. break the tension, Mr. Fredman introduced a bit of levity. Noting the big turnout, obviously drawn by advance notice of his planned departure, the gregarious matrimonial lawyer told a joke he considered apt. It seemed, he said, that a Hollywood mogul had died and there was a tremendously large turnout for the funeral. Mystified, someone in the crowd turned to a companion and asked how he accounted for the large crowd. The reply, related the county leader, was: “You know, that's show biz. Give the people what they want.” It brought laughter, but the committee members demonstrated that what they wanted was for Mr. Fredman to remain, and they passed a resolution asking him to reconsider. Many members rose to plead that he do so, praising him for his work in four and a half years as party chairman and pledging their support. Some also took the occasion to complain of reduced party influence with public officials once they were elected to office. Michele Aisenberg of New Rochelle said that as a Democratic National Committee member she could testify that the problem was “endemic throughout the party.” She told of getting a call from the White House advising her that President Carter was going to be in town. Mrs. Aisenberg said she asked the caller if she was invited, and the answer was no. If she wasn't being invited, she said she inquired, why was she being called. The answer, she said, was “because we wanted to touch base.” Mrs. Aisenberg told the committee she was mystified about the meaning of touching base. Inez Singletary, executive director of the Day Care Council of Westchester, was named woman of the year this week by the Westchester County Task Force on Women. Along with a proclamation from the County Executive, she got “a lot of very good feelings and a lot of publicity that I hope will dramatize” the issue of day care. A resident of Pleasantville who has a 15‐year‐old son and a daughter who is a television newscaster in Durham, N.C., Mrs. Singletary said that one of her major concerns for this year was to persuade the county Department of Social Services to raise the amount of income a family may have and still be eligible for day‐care assistance under Title 20 of the Federal Social Security Act. Currently, for a family of four, the figure is $14,600. What Mrs. Singletary and others are concerned about are the families who by virtue of a small costof‐living raise, for example, go over that limit and thus no longer qualify for assistance. “It's the family earning above $15,000 is the family that I'm concerned about.” She said. “In Westchester, you could easily say $20,000.” The award ceremony, took place on Monday in front of the County Office Building, in contrast to last year's presentation in the County Executive's office. The reason, according to Laura Kornfeld, president of the Westchester County Task Force on Women, was that last year's recipient was Polly Rothstein, director of the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion, and it was felt that the presence of “outside forces” might have marred the occasion if it were held in the open. However, of this year's recipient she declared, “Everybody loves Inez.”"
Capital Report: Public Initiative,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/02/archives/new-jersey-weekly-capital-report-public-initiative-capital-report.html,"THERE is a growing demand in New Jersey for “initiative and referendum,” a government device that lets voters propose and pass laws, as well as repeal them. A number of states already have this mechanism, and a score or more legislators have introduced or endorsed amendments to the State Constitution that would allow “I and R” in New Jersey, too. Under the system, if a sufficient number of voters — usually 4 percent of those registered — sign petitions in behalf of a proposed law, a statewide election on the question is held. If approved, the law goes into effect. This was how Proposition 13, the tax‐cutting measure, got on the ballot in California last year. State Senator John H. Dorsey, Republican of Denville and one of the six legislators who have introduced “I and R” resolutions in the State Legislature this session, has been busy drumming up support for the concept. Boards of Chosen Freeholders in six of New Jersey's 21 counties have agreed to ask voters in their counties this fall if they would like to amend the State Constitution to allow “I and R.” The vote would be informal and not binding; however, if the voters in those six counties, and several others where the question also may be on the ballot, endorse the idea, the Legislature might feel impelled to give the entire electorate the chance to amend the Constitution. The counties where the question will be on the ballot for a “straw” vote in November are Hunterdon, Morris, Burlington, Cumberland, Ocean and Atlantic. The idea of allowing voters to pass laws in this fashion is universally endorsed. However, many political scientists consider it dangerous because most measures approved by “I and R” deal with emotional issues, such as abortion, the death penalty and taxes. Surprisingly, most support for “I and R” has come from Republicans. However, a number of Democrats also have endorsed the idea, and two of the resolutions pending in the Legislature were introduced by Democrats, State Senator William V. Musto of Union City and Assemblyman Paul J. Contillo of Paramus. The pending resolutions call for an amendment to the State Constitution that, if approved, would give the voters the option of using “I and R.” In addition to Mr. Dorsey, Republicans who have introduced such resolutions are Assemblyman James R. Hurley of Millville and Assemblywomen Barbara A. Curran of Summit and Marie A. Muhler of Marlboro. The Democratic leadership of the Legislature has not been too enthusiastic about the initiative and. referendum system of passing or repealing laws, and seems determined to delay matters until it is too late to add a proposed Constitutional amendment to the November ballot. All 80 members of the Assembly are up for election this year, and this Democratic delay is expected to be a G.O.P. issue. The leadership, though, has taken note of the growing public interest, as evidenced by the Boards of Chosen Freeholders. Assemblyman Richard J. Codey, Democrat of Orange, has called for public hearing in Trenton this Thursday. It will be held in the Assembly chamber, starting at 10:30 A.M. Governor Byrne may already be tired of the criticism directed at him for allegedly having met privately with Clifford Perlman, a gambling‐casino executive, in Las Vegas last month, but he's going to hear a lot more about it. The Republican Party is making the meeting a campaign issue in this fall's Assembly elections. David Norcross, the Republican State Chairman, said that he and many other voters were not inclined to accept a blanket denial by the Governor that there had been any unethical conduct. Mr. Byrne has denied a published report that he met privately with Mr. Perlman, chairman of Caesars World, and discussed in a roundabout way his going to work for Caesars after his term as Governor expires. “The day is long gone when citizens are willing to take a politician's word that a questionable action was harmless, particularly when it involves an area as sensitive and lucrative as casino licensing,” Mr. Norcross said. Mr. Byrne and his daughter went to Las Vegas to promote New Jersey on the Mike Douglas TV show, which was taped at Caesars World there. While in Nevada, the Governor went to a nationally televised prizefight with Mr. Perlman. The Republicans had asked Attorney General John J. Degnan to investigate the Governor's meeting with Mr. Perlman. When Mr. Degnan said there was nothing to investigate, they began calling for an independently elected Attorney General. Questions were raised about the meeting between Mr. Byrne and Mr. Perlman because Caesars World has applied for a permanent license for its gambling casino in Atlantic City. It now has a temporary permit that expires early next year. The Casino Control Commission, which is appointed by the Governor, will decide whether Caesars will get its license. On another front, Mr. Degnan has asked the State Supreme Court to expedite hearings on his new regulations abolishing retail minimum prices for liquor and wine. It has been estimated that the new rules, which were supposed to go into effect earlier this year, would save consumers at least $50 million annually. The liquor industry is vigorously protesting the new regulations. Price‐fixing has been in effect in New Jersey for decades. Several suits challenging the regulations have been filed in Superior Court. If they take the usual course, it could be many months before there is a final decision. In an unusual action last week, Mr. Degnan asked the Supreme Court to take immediate jurisdiction and consolidate the suits so that “the uncertainty within the alcholic beverage industry” can be ended and consumers may begin enjoying lower prices. If the Supreme Court agrees, which it is expected to, as much as a year may be saved."
Congress Faces Key Spending Decisions as Vacation Ends,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/02/archives/congress-faces-key-spending-decisions-as-vacation-ends-budget-link.html,"Congress returns to Washington Wednesday after a monthlong vacation and faces a series of decisions on how to spend the taxpayers' money for the production of energy, the development of new weapons, the rescue of the Chrysler Corporation and dozens of other pressing issues. With the economy slumping into recession, the lawmakers will also have to decide whether to cut taxes, even at the risk of fanning inflation, now running at an annual rate of 13.2 percent. A cut would be politically popular, but it would probably end all hope of balancing the budget next year. “Balanced budget” was one of the most popular cliches on Capitol Hill earlier this year, but now that the legislators are forced to deal with the practical implications of that concept, the rhetoric seems to be fading. Budget Link to Arms Pact The budget debate has now become entangled with the treaty with the Soviet Union to limit strategic arms, which will dominate activity on the Senate floor this fall. Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, and other leading Senate voices on military matters are demanding a large rise in military spending as their price for support of the treaty. Congress's record over the coming months could have a major impact on the Presidential campaigns, which start in earnest this fall. Before the August recess, President Carter's aides were conceding that the President had come to Washington with few friends on Capitol Hill and had done a poor job of making new ones. Hardly a day passed in late July without a Congressional delegation being invited over to the White House for a chat. At the same time that he was trying to make friends with the lawmakers, however, the President was attacking their record and threatening to oppose them next year. Since about 70 percent of the Democrats ran ahead of the President in their districts last year, most of them laughed off the political threat. But many of them also felt that the President could not have it both ways and would have to choose between conciliation and conflict. Criticism From Democrats Before they left town, Democratic leaders voiced deep concern about what they felt were dilatory tactics used by the Republicans and the maverick impulses of some of their own members. Near‐anarchy reigned on the House floor when the members voted a series of special‐interest exemptions into the bill on standby gas rationing authority and fuel conservation. As a result, the leaders have talked about sending bills to the floor under closed or modified rules, parliamentary devices that would restrict the amendments offered on the House floor. But any such attempt would carry a big political risk. “Many members would resent the idea and start talking about gag rule,” said one member of the leadership staff. “But on the other hand, can the House keep going this way?” The number one legislative priority this fall will be energy, and visits to a number of Congressional districts during the recess indicated that many voters were pressing their Representatives for concrete decisions. As Representative Phil Gramm, a freshman Democrat from Texas, put it, “The basic message I'm getting is this: We're tired of all the talk about an energy program; we want to see some action.” But reaching agreement on what action to take is far more difficult. For instance, the gas rationing bill is now before a House‐Senate conference committee, which must decide how to balance the national need for a standby plan against the fierce demand by local interests for special treatment. ‘Windfall’ Profits Tax The House has already passed a bill that would tax away “windfall” profits earned by oil companies after the decontrol of fuel prices, and the issue is now before the Senate Finance Committee. The committee chairman, Russell B. Long, Democrat of Louisiana, who is a staunch defender of oil interests, wants to weaken the proposal, while the White House is fighting to toughen it up. The tax is likely to pass in some form but that will ignite another battle over how to spend the “windfall” revenues flowing into the Treasury. House and Senate committees are both considering proposals for “fast track” legislation, some sort of system to speed up decision‐making on key energy projects. The idea frightens environmentalists, who fear it will be used as an excuse to eviscerate many recent antipollution laws. The House also adopted a proposal to finance the development of a synthetic fuels industry, but the Senate has ordered a study, due Sept. 15, describing the impact the proposal would have on the Federal budget. The budget will be a major item of discussion right after Labor Day, since Congress is required to adopt a second, and binding, budget resolution by the end of next month. The first budget, passed last spring, projected a deficit of $23 billion, $6 billion below Mr. Carter's proposal. But Congress has been distinctly unwilling to make the spending cuts that would reduce the deficit to such proportions. Accordingly, the Senate Budget Committee voted just before the recess to instruct six Senate committees to eliminate $4 billion from their spending proposals. Cuts of that magnitude would be very hard to achieve. Congress is finding out that, while everybody approves of a balanced budget in principle, every vested interest in town wants somebody else to make the necessary sacrifices. The yawning budget deficit is also being invoked by opponents of the proposal to provide Federal aid to the financially troubled Chrysler Corporation. Over the recess, lawmakers heard a chorus of constituents echo the views of the man who told a town meeting in Arlington, Tex.: “If Chrysler can't cut it, they ought to go down the tubes.” Military Spending Demands The budget situation has been further complicated by demands for more military spending. President Carter has indicated that he will ask for increases that amount to 3 percent after inflation. That increase would certainly widen the budget deficit but might not satisfy critics of the arms treaty. In many Congressional districts, inflation remains the most painful political problem, but there are few legislative remedies available to Congress. Some members sensed a growing support for mandatory wage and price controls, but Mr. Carter remains adamantly opposed to the idea. A tax cut to revive purchasing power would have enormous appeal, and just before the recess Republicans proposed a package of reductions totaling $36 billion. Mr. Carter and Democratic Congressional leaders continue to believe that a tax cut now would hamper the anti‐infla tion fight, but the pressure will undoubtedly grow as the election year approaches. Some Democrats are advocating a cut in the range of $10 billion to $15 billion, or just enough to restore taxpayers to their pre‐inflation tax brackets. Containing Hospital Costs One of Mr. Carter's major anti‐inflation proposals, holding down hospital costs, has passed two Congressional committees in somewhat weakened form, but it still faces an uphill battle. Patricia Roberts Harris, the new Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, will also be involved in coming battles over a proposed department of education and Federal financing for abortions. With the election year approaching, Congress will be considering a proposal to limit the contributions that can be made by political action committees, or PAC's. Another bill designed to limit the influence of special interests would require lobbyists to disclose some of their income and methods of operation. Some analysts believe that Congress might still pass the first step in a comprhensive national health insurance plan, but that issue could become entangled in the political scuffling between President Carter and Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts. The continuing tension and rivalry between these two men is likely to provide one of the dramatic highlights of the fall season on Capitol Hill."
World News Briefs,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/06/archives/world-news-briefs-pope-calls-in-dutch-bishops-in-bid-to-resolve.html,"ROME, Sept. 5 (AP) — The Vatican said today that Pope John Paul II had summoned seven Dutch bishops to an extraordinary synod in Rome in January to try to resolve differences in their ranks. Vatican sources said the synod, scheduled to begin Jan. 14, would attempt to settle disputes over such issues as abortion, homosexuality and birth control. A Vatican announcement said the synod would consider “ecclesiastical work in the Netherlands and examine the present status of pastoral activities.” There has been friction between so‐called traditional and progressive wings of the Dutch church since the mid‐1960's. There are about six million Roman Catholics in the Netherlands, about 40 percent of the population. PALAU, Sardinia, Sept. 5 (Reuters) —Kidnappers freed a London industrialist early today and told him to raise a ransom of $24.5 million for the release of his wife and daughter. The industrialist, Rolf Schild, was found on a deserted road near the town of Bono in a mountainous region of central Sardinia. He had made an eight‐hour journey on horseback and foot after being freed. A bus driver, Alberigo Dore, said that he first drove past Mr. Schild. suspecting he was drunk. But he said he stopped on his return trip when he saw Mr. Schild kneeling in the middle of the road, begging for help. “He was just a skeleton of a man,” Mr. Dore said. “He hardly had the energy to climb into the bus.” The 55‐year‐old Mr. Schild, who is suffering from a slight heart condition, said he and his family had been put through terrible ordeal. Mr. Schild, an electronics engineer, his wife, Daphne, and 14‐year‐old daughter, Annabelle, were kidnapped Aug. 21 near their vacation villa in the northeast coastal resort of Palau. NEAR DEGAHABUR, Ethiopia, Sept. 5 (Reuters) — Guerrillas seeking autonomy for the Ogaden area of eastern Ethiopia said today that they had broken off a 36‐hour battle with Cuban‐led Ethiopian troops after killing 400 of them. Smoke visible for 20 miles hung over the battleground near here as guerrillas of the Western Somali Liberation Front, some wounded, returned to their camouflaged desert encampment and described the action. The divisional commander, Hussein Nuh, said that the guerrillas had waited in ambush for two days for a convoy of 260 trucks and 15 Soviet‐built T‐54 tanks protected by about 1,500 Ethiopian soldiers. MANILA, Sept. 5 (UPI) — A mercy ship has rescued 135 Vietnamese and the United States Navy vessel White Plains sailed today toward another group of refugees whose boat was adrift in the South China Sea. The Akuna, used for rescue operations by a private Canadian‐American organization called Food for the Hungry, docked in Singapore with 135 refugees rescued in the last 10 days. A Navy spokesman said a 30‐foot fishing junk carrying 24 men, 12 women and 12 children had been spotted “dead in the water” about 250 miles south of the tip of Vietnam. The White Plains, guided by an Orion spotter plane, headed for the refugee boat and was expected to reach it by nightfall. On Monday, the White Plains made the Seventh Fleet's biggest rescue of refugees in a single day when it plucked 154 from two crippled boats in the South China Sea."
Conservative‐Liberal Clergyman,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/08/archives/conservativeliberal-clergyman-robert-alexander-kennedy-runcie-man.html,"LONDON, Sept. 7 — Dashing war hero, pig breeder, brilliant debater, dinner‐table wit — these were among the descriptions of the next Archbishop of Canterbury given by newspapers, television and radio when the choice was announced today. Man in the News The 57‐year‐old Archbishop‐designate, with a firm grip on modesty and humor, described himself as “the son of a lapsed Presbyterian Scot.” Of his elevation to the See of Canterbury he said, “I feel terrified and helpless.” Robert Alexander Kennedy Runcie, since 1970 Bishop of St. Albans, will take over as spiritual leader of the Anglican communion in January. He characterized the Church of England, which he will head, as “a most lovable and infuriating body.” If he had to put a label on himself, he went on, it would be “radical Catholic”; that would make him something of an infuriating body to those of Low Church persuasion. To those close to him at St. Albans, an ancient cathedral city just north of London, one of his most attractive qualities is a lack of stuffiness. In talking about his family, they recall, he described his father, an electrical engineer, as a keen racing man with “a profound distrust of both parsons and policemen.” From Oxford to Sandhurst Beginning his education in Merchant Taylors' School in Liverpool, Robert Runcie, who was born Oct. 2, 1921, won a scholarship to Brasenose College, Oxford, but had time to spend only a year there before World War II began. He went to Sandhurst, the British equivalent of West Point, and became a tank officer in the Scots Guards Armored Division. During the final thrust into Germany in 1945, one of the three tanks he commanded was knocked out and set ablaze. He ran from his tank under a hail of fire and rescued one of the men trapped in the burning tank. For this he won the Military Cross, one of the highest British decorations. Returning to Oxford, he studied literature and the humanities and only in the final term, he has said, did he decide to go into the church. He attended Westcott House, a theological college in Cambridge, and later was its chaplain and head. He became a deacon in 1950 and a priest in 1951. He also served as principal of a theological school, Cuddesdon College, outside Oxford, from 1960 to 1969. It was there, he recalls, that he gained insights into rural communities and their loyalties, learning much from his students. He also began keeping pigs there, and he expressed the hope today that he could find time to see his Berkshire pedigree pigs after he moves into Lambeth Palace, the archepiscopal residence beside the Thames across from Parliament. Influential in Broadcasting Since 1973 he has held the influential post of chairman of the Central Religious Advisory Committee, which deals with all religious broadcasting in Britain. In good humored reply to questions at a news conference today, the Archbishop‐designate said marriage “should be for life” but that there should be “room for forgiveness and renewal,” and, he added, in some cases there should be divorce. “I believe remarriage should be possible in a church in certain cases even though the previous partner is still alive,” he said. He declined to comment on the issues of abortion and homosexuality until he had had a chance to study them further, but on the subject of women priests he said he was against them “on principle and in practice” at present. His wife, Rosalind Turner, whom he married in 1957, is a professional pianist. They have two children, aged 20 and 17. Mrs. Runcie often broke in to amend her husband's responses and she also had pointed comments of her own. Pressed about her faith, she said there was no use asking such questions. “I'm a musician, not a theologian,” she said. “I'm a Christian, but I'm not on my knees all day.”"

Recent fiction - including the work of Saul Bellow, Norman Mailer, John Updike, Kurt Vonnegut and most of their contemporaries - suffers from a simple failure of morality and humanity. This angry polemic by the critic‐novelist seemed to our reviewer, Roger Sale, “an easily written and singleminded assault .. . that never gets much past pronouncements and dos n to the essential facts.” DADDYJI, by Ved Mehta. (Oxford University Press, $3.95.) The story of Amolak Ram Mehta, native of the Punjab who, during the first four decades of this century, studied medicine and specialized in disease control in England, America and Sardinia before returning to India to raise a family of his own. This biography by his son, told through a series of cameo portraits, makes one man's experience seem timeless and universal. III"
8 Held in Anti‐Abortion Protest,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/10/archives/8-held-in-antiabortion-protest.html,"CHICAGO, Sept. 9 (UPI) — Eighty members of an anti‐abortion group were arrested yesterday at a protest outside an abortion clinic.

Books of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/10/archives/books-of-the-times-reenacting-the-tragedy.html,"SAY this for what Alan Saperstein achieves in his unusual first novel, “Mom Kllls Kids and Self”: He never stoops to the sensationalism of his tabloid title. No, By Christopher Lehmann‐Haupt MOM KILLS KIDS AND SELF. By Alan Saperstein. 239 pages. Macmillan. 59.95. we are already far beyond gore and gossip in the opening paragraph of the book, in which the nameless narrator explains: “When I arrived home from work I found my wife had killed our two sons and taken her own life. The cat was only sleeping.” We are sealed inside his state of shock, like the scream that is trapped in his throat. We can see only deranged images — the dead woman's form through the bottom of a bourbon glass, refracted in such a way that she seemed to move “if I tipped it slightly”; this figure of Kojak sniffing the burned chili on the stove: “I'm gonna tell you something you're not going to like. I don't think your wife did this. I think she was murdered and the kids were murdered and the killer made it look like suicide and like that.” It will be over 90 hours and 200 pages before the scream and we readers are finally released. In the meantime the husband and father of the dead will put himself through mad paces of drinking, golf‐club swinging, lawn mowing, gardening, swimming and pool tending. He will even pay a Saturday afternoon call on his New York City office, where he will set in motion, and at the last minute abort, an attempt to extort a woman he hardly knows, a Mrs. T., into sleeping with him. Re‐Enacting the Tragedy And all the while he will agonizingly reconstruct the circumstances that must have led his nameless wife to commit her desperate act: Her mother's recent death, his neglect of her for his successful career in market research, his mistress in Cleveland, the behavior of their pre‐autistic 7‐year‐old boy, the natural deviltry of their 4‐year‐old boy, her violation by a college student who once forced his way into their apartment when the husband was away on business and performed a sort of visual rape of her from which she never quite recovered, the thousand natural shocks that housewives are heir to, and, finally, the precipitating incident — “the little one's messy refusal to be toilet trained and the seven‐year‐old's constant sneaking down of his mother's habitual iced coffee.” “My mind .re‐enacted her discovering the trail of [filth] and becoming furious and then, in the middle of cleaning up after the little one, noticing that the older one had once again stolen her iced coffee while she had gone for the Wipe ‘n Dipes, and I could picture the veins in her slender neck redden and bulge as she screamed her unheeded reprimands, and I could hear her hoarse screams turn into sarcasm and then despair and then loathing and then murder.” What it all adds up to, I suppose, is a fully orchestrated indictment of the American way of marriage. But oh, the dreariness of it all. To be suspended for so long in a gray state of horror without being able to weep or understand or mourn; to know so early in the game what Mr. Saperstein is up to and to be able to predict at the start of each scene the point that it will wind up making: It is not tragic or enobling or cathartic. It is simply depressing. So I rebelled. I rebelled by canceling my emotional involvement in Mr. Saperstein's story. And the consequence of doing so was that I did not believe. I did not believe that among the first things the man would do upon discovering his dead family would be to get out his golf clubs and start swinging them wildly enough to smash both his television set and one of his toes. That seemed contrived to make a symbolic point, just as so much of what he does seems forced to make a point. Points of Disbelief I did not believe that Mrs. T. would come to his office just because he threatens to tell her husband about “the abortion, the playacting in bed, the margarine in the seven‐layer cake,” nor did I believe that she would forgive him so easily after he decides to call his rape attempt off. Symbolically, Mrs. T. might do these things; on Mr. Saperstein's diagram of the degradation of Woman she might do them. But not in life. Finally, I even ceased to believe in the basic premise of “Mom Kills Kids and Self.” Perhaps this was because I was never able to figure out why the mother did what she did. (I understand why the father thinks she did it, but she has no reality beyond his ideas.) Or perhaps it was because, despite the narrator's assurance that it is a common occurrence for mothers to destroy their children and themselves, I couldn't offhand recall any other such case, except Medea's, and she spared herself. (On the other hand, I can remember dozens of cases of “Dad Slays Wife, Kids, Self.”) All of which suggests that Moms don't tend to kill kids and self — that Mr. Saperstein's novel may be an interesting anatomy of a husband's guilt, but it finally has little to say about how women suffer."
Around the Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/11/archives/around-the-nation-visit-of-pope-to-boston-sparks-churchstate-debate.html,"BOSTON, Sept. 10 (AP) — Protestants, a civil rights group and an advocate of birth control and abortion raised questions today about the constitutional separation of church and state as Boston prepared for the Oct. 1 visit of Pope John Paul II. Two Protestant ministers and a spokesman for the Civil Liberities Union of Massachusetts, testifying in a City Council hearing, objected to the use of city money to construct two platforms to be used in the Pope's celebration of an outdoor mass. Boston is the first stop on the Pope's visit to the United States, and the outdoor mass on the Boston Common will be his first public event. “Is it appropriate to spend public tax dollars, public tax money for a religious service on the Boston Common?” asked Dr. Kenneth Claus, a United Church of Christ minister. The City Council is considering Mayor Kevin H. White's request for $700,000 to pay for expenses related to the Pope's visit. Ernest Winsor, president of the Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, joined Dr. Claus and the Rev. Charles Harper, another United Church of Christ minister, in opposing the money for the platforms. Bill Baird, an abortion and birth control advocate, said that he would file suit to block the expenditures if they were approved by the council, as expected. Weapons Plant Supervisors Fill in for Striking Guards AMARILLO, Tex., Sept. 10 (AP) — All 150 guards at the nation's only nuclear warhead assembly plant went on strike today, but officials said that supervisors trained in security measures were protecting the complex. “We have replaced striking guards on a one‐for‐one minimum,” said the manager of the Government‐owned Pantex plant, Paul Wagner, an official in the Department of Energy. The guards, members of the International Guards Union of America, Local 38, set up picket lines at the plant, northeast of here, after their contract with Pantex expired. Plant officials said that operations were normal at the plant, where 1,800 people assemble components of nuclear weapons for the Defense Department. Hurricane Frederic Gathers Force Off Coast of Florida MIAMI, Sept. 10 (UPI) — Frederic became a hurricane today for the second time and began to build in intensity as it moved into the Gulf of Mexico. Forecasters said they were uncertain where the storm was headed. By late last night the center of the storm, which was moving northwest at 5 miles an hour, was 150 miles west‐southwest of Key West, Fla. Its sustained winds increased from 75 to 85 miles an hour in only about four hours, and the National Hurricane Center warned that it expected the winds to grow in intensity. Forecasters said that they could not be certain about where the hurricane might strike because slow moving storms were often erratic. In Key West, which was buffeted by gale force winds and heavy rains, many business firms allowed their employees to go home early. Small craft owners from Boca Raton, Fla., southward and westward to the Dry Tortugas were urged to remain in port. Owners of small vessels along Florida's west coast south of Tarpon Springs were urged to remain near safe harbors. Reports of Police Brutality Bring U.S. Panel to Houston HOUSTON, Sept. 10 (AP)—The United States Civil Rights Commission, following up on reports of police brutality in Houston, will spend two days, beginning tomorrow, listening to complaints and reviewing improvements made in the department in the last 18 months. The nation's fifth‐largest city was one of the metropolitian areas pinpointed by the commission for full‐scale hearings on charges of police abuse. Last month, in an unprecedented action, the Justice Department filed a civil suit against Philadelphia and its police department, charging systematic abuse of citizens' rights."
Chinese Women Offer Some Views of Feminism,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/11/archives/chinese-women-offer-some-views-of-feminism-a-grassroots-group.html,"There is a saying in China: “Seeing flowers on a galloping horse.” Substitute buses and airplanes for horses, substitute the American landscape for flowers, and you have Zi Zhongyun's reaction to her fast‐paced, three‐week tour as part of the first delegation to this country of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship With Foreign Countries. “We are seeing so many places I have all kinds of mixed impressions,” said Miss Zi, laughing and throwing up her hands. “I have not had time to digest them.” Among her more vivid impressions, she added, was one of a brunch given in a Chelsea loft this past weekend for her and Lu Chu, a member of the Standing Committee of the AllChina Women's Federation. In contrast to most so‐called “people‐to‐people” receptions now occurring around the country as growing numbers of Chinese visitors arrive here, the atmosphere at the brunch was deliberately casual and strictly “women to women.” The buffet table set the mood — paper plates and Chinese take‐out. As Edith Penty of the United States‐China Peoples Friendship Association, which was host for the brunch and the tour, explained: “We can't be bothered cooking and cleaning.” A Grass‐Roots Group Rather, she said, the 70 American women at the reception were more concerned with feminist issues: “This is the first time that a grassroots group of American women — Asians, blacks, Hispanics, whites — are meeting with women from the People's Republic of China and they have many questions to ask them.” As it turned out, not all of their questions were answered. Asked about sensitive issues such as abortion on demand or interracial marriage or prison conditions, Miss Lu and Miss Zi politely ducked the questions, pleading a lack of time. But they did speak for some time and with much intensity on the relationship between the aims of the Chinese women's movement and the plans for modernization of the nation's industry, agriculture and technology. The two are inexorably linked, they said. Miss Lu, a serene, white‐haired woman of 75 years, said that her family does not yet have a washing machine. Although China's new marriage law requires husbands to share household chores, she said, neither sex can be truly “liberated” until washers and other labor‐saving devices become fixtures in Chinese homes. Similarly, Miss Zi, who is 49, explained that while labor laws guarantee “equal pay for equal work,” the equipment used on farms and factories is so heavy and outmoded that women are at a disadvantage when earning “work points.” Modern machinery will benefit both sexes, she said. Reports of U.S. Feminists In other ways, the Chinese women saw themselves as more fortunate than some of their American counterparts. Miss Lu, who has traveled widely in the service of her Government, said she was “surprised” to hear tales of battered wives and children from feminists here. “Is it true that husbands are beating wives?” she asked, looking out across the audience. “Yes, yes!” the American women chorused. When told that wife beating was a crime, but that women were nonetheless being brutalized by their husbands, “even women in this room,” the Chinese visitors gasped. “My husband would not dare to do that!” Miss Lu declared to loud applause. Another thing that surprised the Chinese women on their tour was the numbers of male faces seen in Congress. Why, they wondered, was there only one woman Senator? Of the 435 Representatives, why only 16 women? Found ‘a Contradiction’ By contrast, they said, Chinese women make up 21 percent of the delegates to the National People's Congress, which has four women deputy chairmen on its Standing Committee. There is also one woman Deputy Prime Minister and 14 ministers and deputy ministers. Moreover, Miss Lu said, women have even greater representation on the revolutionary committees in the provinces. “The lower you go, the more women,” she explained, adding that this was significant since the women's movement in China sought to reach the “broad masses.” Having heard and read about the advances of the women's movement in this country, the Chinese visitors said they found “a contradiction” in reality. Leaning across the speaker's table with a broad smile, Miss Lu told the audience: “We would like you to explain, in general, how this is?” In general, the American women chalked things up to the American system. “Unlike your society, ours is very stratified,” replied Sandy Lowe of the National Congress of Neighborhood Women. “People here live different lives and have many different interests.” She paused to glance around the room at the audience. It included women of many races and classes, representing a range of causes from the International Ladies Garment Workers to the National Lawyers Guild, from the National Committee on Household Employment to the National Organization for Women, from the Gray Panthers to the Creative Women's Collective. ‘Diffuses Our Efforts’ “We're not all working for the same goals,” Miss Lowe continued. “And that diffuses our efforts.” Racism was cited as another problem. “Our society is based on racism,” contended Angela Jorge of the National Conference of Puerto Rican Women. “You do not encounter this in China. When we no longer look at skin color to determine our health care delivery, the neighborhoods we live in, the economic level we have, then we can talk about our common goals.” The Chinese visitors nodded sympathetically. Then, already late for a tour of Bloomingdale's, they departed, carrying equal rights amendment T‐shirts."
Play: ‘After the Rise’ In Red‐Baiting 50's,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/11/archives/play-after-the-rise-in-redbaiting-50s-roman-a-clef.html,"IF I'd realized, before setting foot in the Astor Place Theater, that the title of Gerhard Borris's “After the Rise” was really and truly a bit of wordplay drawn directly from the title of Arthur Miller's “After the Fall,” I think I might have gone elsewhere. Back to “Oh! Calcutta!” perhaps, which I haven't seen in quite few years now. Actually, I did notice the similarity in titles, but — for what seemed to me good and sufficient reasons —plunged blindly on, dismissing the possibility that this was going to be yet another roman à clef with Mr. Miller and Marilyn Monroe as its barely disguised centerpieces. After all, the author (who also directs) is German‐trained and until now has done all of his work on the Continent. It didn't seem terribly likely that he'd have either the effrontery or the information to race across the Atlantic with the hot news, the unassailable lowdown on what happened to celebrated relationship, at this point. I was further distracted, or caught napping, by the advance announcement that the play was to be something of a multimedia event, taking the form of “an illustrated interview.” Nothing there to suggest that the Red‐baiting of the 1950's was to be our background for the evening. Sounded, rather, like one more leap ahead for technology, of which we must all dutifully keep abreast. A word about that. It's not a leap here, it's a lapse. What happens is this. The entire rear wall of the stage at the Astor Place is covered by a CinemaScope‐shaped screen, on which living rooms and well‐kept lawns are projected whenever real actors are acting, if that's what they're doing. In between these scenes — and with the performers now safely tucked away in the wings — the screen is given over to excerpts from a filmed conversation between one of those tough‐minded talkshow hosts so much in evidence these days and his loftily self‐assured guest. (The guest is called Oscar Fisher, just to keep him from being mistaken for Arthur Miller, though some of the more slovenly spoken players manage to make “Oscar” sound suspiciously like “Arthur.”) The idea is to prod Mr. Fisher into making flat statements. He and his divorced first wife, he says, “parted as friends.” He subsequently married blond and pouting Hollywood sex symbol, he says, out of a deep spiritual love. After each such statement we dissolve into the real‐life situation on stage. Naturally, in real life he is having a violent quarrel with that first wife, behaving most conspicuously like a cad. Just as naturally, his marriage to the film star (who is really looking fora “father image”) is a marriage arranged by his managers to build up sympathy for him when he testifies before the House Un‐American Activities Two things are off base here. After the first couple of shifts from film to stage, we know for absolute certain that the upcoming stage scene will flatly contradict the televised statement. Since there must be 20 or 30 of these, we stop holding our breath after a while. And the dissolves themselves don't dissolve. The screen goes dark. In the dark, which is rather prolonged, we hear the actors scurrying or groping, whichever it may be, to get into position before the lights go up. It sounds like a convocation of mice. Perhaps should say rats, since nearly everybody in the piece is presented as despicable. I would not call the effect an electronic But back to those bad, bad people. Mr. Fisher is a lout, out‐and‐out, callously cruel to his first wife, leaving his second to die of an overdose of sleeping pills, refusing to speak up for his oldest friend, lying, lying, lying. He leaves trail of havoc in his wake that Humcane David wouldn't have dared aspire to. His agent‐manager, bald above blazing sport shirt, is the sort of chap who ruminates emphatically: “This country's a refuge for freedom, it still is, and we've got the House Un‐American Activities to see that it stays that way.” A moment later he's apoplectically asking, “Would you want your daughter to marry a nigger?” A line never expected to hear again in a play, even a period play. The author will use any sort of phrase, no matter how primitive or how stale, as a club. Out front it feels queasy. Though you have to stay for the second act to discover it, the pungent interviewer, so proud of his integrity, proves rotten to the core as well (he's blackmailed into being less pungent because he once caused a girl to have an abortion). They're a craven lot, then, with precious few exceptions. The Hollywood star, whose death is unconscionably milked by letting us see her several times sprawled over the bed's edge with her golden hair trailing the floor, is sentimentalized as an utter innocent. The effort at sympathy doesn't pay off, though, because actress Jeannie Leigh Allison reads all of her lines in a treble whine that sounds like a telephone receiver someone's left off the hook. Ward Asquith, as a writer denied work (getting no help from Fisher, he too commits suicide), comes closest to summoning up some sort of dramatic energy on a flaccid stage; and Nicholas Saunders, as a cripple who's never reneged on his revolutionary past, would be good if he weren't subjected to some extraordinarily feeble staging. In making heels of very nearly his entire cast of characters, author Borris is of course looking for ironies. Everyone can be bought, opportunism rules the roost. But the ironies are all predictable, and when they come — so crudely stated — they land like lead. Worse. In rerunning this material one more time for whatever titillation is left in it, the play itself is opportunist. And little else. I understand there's recently been book on Marilyn Monroe written by her former seamstress. It can't be as embarrassing as “After the Rise.” Roman à Clef AFTER THE RISE, an illustrated Interview, written and directed by Gerhard Borris.

Salt Lake City Changing as Ties to Mormon Church Fade,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/12/archives/salt-lake-city-changing-as-ties-to-mormon-church-fade-symphony-hall.html,"SALT LAKE CITY, Utah — This city in a valley between the mountains, which has long served as the capital and as the fortress of the Mormon religion, is taking on a more secular character. The mormons fled to this area in 1897 to avoid religious persecution, and for years Salt Lake City has seemed to outsiders to be in a sort of Rip Van Winkle sleep, to be a place that remained improbably wholesome while other cities were wracked with problems. The Mormon influence is still dominant in Salt Lake City, but now there is change as well as stability — physical change as the town grows, enormous economic change as it develops into a regional trading center, and emotional change as the church and its members adapt. This weekend will mark something of a coming‐out party for the city. Symphony Hall Dedication The occasion is the formal dedication Friday and Saturday of the $90 million Utah Symphony Hall, a handsome, angular, glass-and-buff-brick affair. The new $4.5 million Salt Lake Arts Center next door is already open. There is to be a civic whoop-de-do for the grand opening, and the city's suspenders are already straining with pride, although there is some anxiety that all that gold leaf in the lobby may be too. But Salt Lake City isn't a nouveau riche town that has gone out and bought itself some culture with a capital C. The Utah Symphony and the city's three dance companies, with their indefatigable touring, are known throughout the mountain West. Salt Lake's best‐known musical commodity is, of course, the Mormon TabernacleChoir. Reputation for Excellence But the Utah Symphony has a long-established reputation for excellence. The recent retirement of its conductor of 32 years, Maurice Abravanel, has left it somewhat adrift, however, and a series of guest conductors will appear this season while the search for his replacement is under way. Stanislaw Skrowaczewski, formerly of the Minnesota Orchestra, will conduct on opening night at the new symphony hall. The proof will be in the playing, but early predictions are that the hall is an acoustical gem. It was designed by Fowler, Ferguson, Kingston and Ruben of Salt Lake City. The city's three dance companies, the Ballet West, the Ririe‐Woodbury Company and the Repertory Dance Theater, use the recently restored Capitol Theater, which had gone into decline as a movie house. When the tacky neon-andmetal front was torn away, an old terracotta front, an endearingly ornate confection in the style of an Italian palazzo, was discovered. Downtown Being Renewed Salt Lake City's entire downtown has been done over, in fact, to mixed reviews. The original renewal plan was to make Main Street a pedestrian mall, but there was a compromise and the street was simply narrowed and bedecked with trees and fountains. While a church‐owned shopping center at the head of Main Street is doing well, merchants further south are complaining that their customers were driven away', by the long period when the sidewalks were torn up. Elliott Wolfe of Wolfe's Sporting Goods Emporium said bitterly, “We have flowers, we have trees, we have benches, we have everything but customers.” Salt Lake City has always been a pretty and prosperous town. It is in the valley between the Wasatch and the Oquirrh (pronounced O‐kwur) mountain ranges, near some of the loveliest mountain scenery anywhere in the West. Brigham Young laid out the town according to a plan drawn by Joseph Smith, founder of the Mormon Church, with streets wide enough for a full team of oxen and a covered wagon to turn around. But, like all high‐altitude cities, Salt Lake City is susceptible to air pollution, and the city's rapid growth, with its accompanying increase in automobiles, is causing more pollution than the Kennecott Copper Corporation's huge smelter. Utah is the seventh fastest‐growing state in the nation, and 70 percent of its population lives along the Wasatch front, from Ogden, to the north of Salt Lake, to Provo, on its south. The metropolitan area has grown from 557,000 in 1970 to 840,000 today. At least 85 percent of Salt Lake City's residents are Mormons. The city was built on mining and agriculture, but World War II brought a huge investment in military bases and ordnance depots. It has most recently grown as a warehousing and distribution center. The state does not tax inventories, which makes the city especially attractive for warehousing, and it is a logical regional center since it is the only city of size between Denver and California. Hotel Industry Booming A dozen ski resorts that attract tourists from all over the country are within an hour of the airport, including Alta and Snowbird, the twin meccas of deep powder skiers. The growth in tourism has fostered a boom in hotels, including a Howard Johnson, a Sheraton, a Marriott and a Hilton, but the finest hotel in Salt Lake is still the grand old Hotel Utah, known for its superb service. The question that fascinates outsiders most is the effect that all this growth is having on the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter‐day Saints. The Mormon Church has long had a dual life: it is both a religion and a huge corporation. In addition to hotels, it owns the city's afternoon newspaper, The Deseret News; a commercial printing company; the city's largest bookstore; the shopping mall; a broadcasting holding company that owns six television stations, including the largest in Salt Lake City; about 30 blocks of prime downtown real estate, and much, much more. And it pays full corporate taxes on all its commercial holdings. The church releases no figures, but five years ago, its income from industries was estimated by Nation's Business magazine at more than $125 million. 5,000 Buildings Around World The church encourages tithing by its members and, worldwide, owns more than 5,000 buildings for religious purposes. In New York City, the church has a visitors’ center at Broadway and 65th Street. To an outsider the church would seem to have a strong grip still on the city and state. The Governor, the entire Congressional delegation, 90 percent of the Legislature and 70 percent of the people in Utah are Mormon. But those who have known the city for a long time say the changes are striking. The old antagonism between the “saints” and the “gentiles” - in Mormon parlance, all non‐Mormons are gentiles - is gone. From before the turn of the century to around 1920, the feud between the two groups was ferocious. The gentile‐owned Salt Lake Tribune said in an editorial on the occasion of Brigham Young's death, “The most graceful act of his life has been his death.” There is now noticeable unanimity of purpose between the two groups when it comes to the betterment of Salt Lake City. The church, for example, contributed much of the land for both the Salt Palace sports and convention center and for the new arts complex. Although the church is strongly opposed to alcohol and would not permit liquor by the drink, it gave way to tourist demand, in an unusual compromise: the itty‐bitty bottle system. You cannot buy a drink as such in a public place, but you can buy an itty‐bitty bottle from a tiny state liquor store tucked into the corner of many a fine restaurant and pour it into the set‐up provided. However, signs warn that alcohol is harmful to your health. The so‐called private clubs downtown can be joined at the drop of a sawbuck. The church is opposed not only to alcohol but also to tobacco, coffee, tea, abortion, the feminist movement, homosexuality, pornography and “permissiveness.” Some gentiles find the climate oppressive, but others enjoy the good things it provides - a relatively low crime rate and emphasis on family life - and ignore the rest. Non‐Mormons now seek out Salt Lake City simply because it is such a pleasant place to live, with the mountains, the skiing and the cleanliness. Jack Goodman, a reporter who has lived in Salt Lake for 25 years, said: “The only time I ever remember feeling different out here was sometimes I thought my kids felt left out because the Mormon kids have so many church‐related activities. I am not what you would call an observant Jew - I go to temple on High Holy Days because it would please my parents - but I joined the temple here so my kids would have a group to feel part of.” So the town changes, builds, reconstructs, and the church bends, too. And more and more people are looking on Salt Lake City and saying, as Brigham Young is supposed to have said when he first viewed it, “This is the place.” The New York TImee/D Grey,ton The new $90 million Utah Symphony Hall is to be dedicated this week The skyline of Salt Lake City stretches along a valley between the Wasatch and Oquirrh mountain ranges, some of the loveliest mountain scenery anywhere"
Cohalan Asserts Victory Marks Start of New Era for Republicans on L.I.,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/13/archives/cohalan-asserts-victory-marks-start-of-new-era-for-republicans-on.html,"BAYPORT, L.I., Sept. 12 — Peter F. Cohalan, the Islip Town Supervisor, said today that his landslide victory over Suffolk County Executive John V. N. Klein for the Republican nomination for County Executive marked “the beginning of a new era for the Republican Party on Long island.” “I was stunned by the margin of victory,” said Mr. Cohalan, who received 41,594 votes to 20,196 for Mr. Klein in yesterday's primary. “It shows that the party is basically united, but wants not only new leadership, but change.” “Hopefully it will be a new kind of party,” added Mr. Cohalan, who met with reporters at his home here before leaving on a four‐day vacation. “We want to open it up, bring in more women and more young people and senior citizens. The Republican Party in Suffolk, as well as nationally, needed to broaden its base.” Mi. Klein not only lost to Mr. Cohalan, but also to William A. Matthews, an accountant, who won the Conservative Party's nomination for County Executive. Mr. Klein attributed his defeats to the $1 billion Southwest Sewer District project, which has been plagued for nearly 10 years by delays, defective work, rising costs and corruption. Dr. Martin J. Feldman, a county legislator and dentist from Deer Park, who was unchallenged in the Democratic primary for County Executive, said his campaign had been helped by the Cohalan and Matthews victories since the heavy turnout and landslide rejection of Mr. Klein indicated that the voters were “tired of business as usual.” Mr. Cohalan said his victory had “tarnished the image” of Joseph Margiotta, the Nassau County Republican chairman, who had supported Mr. Klein in the primary race and had arranged for several prominent Republicans, including Ronald Reagan, the former Governor of California, to endorse Mr. Klein. Marglotta ‘Sorry’ Klein Lost A spokesman for Mr. Margiotta said the chairman had “great respect for Mr. Klein and was sorry a friend had lost.” He added, “As far as his image being tarnished, it would mean the entire New York State Congressional delegation would also be tarnished, since it too had supported Mr. Klein.” At a news conference today at the County Legislature Building in Hauppauge, Dr. Feldman called for the appointment of a county commissioner of investigation “to seek out all the corruption and mismanagement that has gone on over the years in succeeding Republican administrations.” The commissioner, he said, should be appointed by the County Executive from a list of names recommended by the District Attorney, with the approval of the County Legislature. Dr. Feldman described the Republican primary contest between Mr. Klein and Mr. Cohalan as “corruption versus corruption, with the voters choosing corruption.” He said that Mr. Cohalan and Anthony Pace, the Islip Town Republican leader and a major supporter of Mr. Cohalan's bid for County Executive, had not explained the circumstances involving the letting of a $1.6 million Islip insurance contract to a concern partly owned by 1 Mr. Pace's brother. Dr. Donald Doyle, leader of the State Right to Life Party, which has the fourth line on the ballot, said that within the next week, the party would choose or endorse a candidate for virtually every contest in Suffolk County, including that for County Executive. Mr. Cohalan and Mr. Matthews were being “screened” by party leaders, he said, adding that “Dr. Feldman has not sought our endorsement.” Dr. Doyle attributed part of the large vote against Mr. Klein to the County Executive's “pro‐abortion position that woman has the right to abort a child under certain circumstances.” The turnout in yesterday's Republican primary — the first ever for a Suffolk County Executive — was about one‐third of the county's 215,818 enrolled Republicans, who outnumber Democrats by margin of two to one. There are 19,004 enrolled Conservatives."
TV Weekend,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/14/archives/tv-weekend-3-hours-of-serious-music-and-a-tearful-drama.html,"WHILE the commerical networks go into new‐season contortions, public television moves to the other extreme of classical dabblings. Two of the major events on Channel 13 this weekend involve “serious” music. Tomorrow at 9 o'clock, for three hours, the featured attraction on the “Summerfest ‘79” series is “A Gala Night at the Vienna Opera.” Celebrating the opening of a United Nations complex in Vienna, the concert was broadcast live throughout Europe on Sept. 1. Host for this tape recording is Placido Domingo, the tenor, who also appears as a singer and as one of the orchestra conductors. The format is straightforward concert, with the various principals strolling out to center stage for their precious moments in the spotlight. The lineup, however, is very impressive. Leonie Rysanek, Birgit Nilsson, Montserrat Caballé, Sherrill Milnes and Mr. Domingo are some of the better‐known participants. Music lovers will not, for the most part, be disappointed. On Sunday at 3:30 P.M., Ponchielli's “La Gioconda” will be broadcast live from the San Francisco Opera. John Goberman, overseer of the “Live From Lincoln Center” series, is the producer. The leading roles will be sung by Renata Scotto and Luciano Pavarotti. The ingredients are clearly promising.  Back in the commerical vineyards, the emphasis is on movies of the theatrical‐release variety. “The Eiger Sanction” with Clint Eastwood is being repeated on NBC tomorrow at o'clock. Sunday at 9 on ABC, Woody Allen's “Annie Hall” is being given its television premiere. CBS is going with a couple of madefor‐television flicks. “The Paradise Connection,” set for tomorrow at 9, stars Buddy Ebsen as a Chicago lawyer searching for his rebellious son in Hawaii. In the course in triumphing over drug smugglers and other assorted gangsters, Mr. Ebsen indulges in some trendy kung‐fu routines. To put it as kindly as possible, he is about 10 years too old for the role. One of the major parts is filmed by Bonnie Ebsen, who happens to be the star's daughter. The producer of this flabby exercise happens to be Buddy Ebsen. On Sunday at 8, CBS has Carol Burnett in “The 10th Month,” an adaptation of a 1970 Laura Z. Hobson novel of the same name. The story is about, to quote the heroine, “a middle‐aged, unwed mother.” Unable to conceive since an earlier abortion, Dori Grey suddenly finds herself pregnant and passionately in love with a man who is not the father. This film treatment, produced by Miss Burnett's husband, Joe Hamilton, doesn't quite work, and not just because the film treatment diverges markedly from the book. In the book, Dori has good reasons to believe she is pregnant before she is going to be with Matthew (Keith Michell). In the film, she is considerably more innocent. In the book, Matthew is a lawyer. In the film, for some unfathomable reason, he is a pianist. And so on, detail after detail, minor and major. More than all of this, however, there is a feeling that the film has been suspended in a vacuum. Miss Hobson's book put Dori's situation in the context of the turbulent 1960's, in the wrenching realities of the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy. Joan Tewkesbury's script, evidently updating the material, is content to exploit some clichés about the factions contending over the difficult issue of abortion. Finally, in order to generate some charm, “The 10th Month” is forced to fall back on some Hispanic characters, who are admittedly diverting, but who also have nothing to do with the book. Miss Burnett, while essentially miscast, manages to be affecting. Mr. Michell, his British manner as snooty as ever, is only irritating. Dina Merrill, as a close friend, gives one of the most outgoing and attractive performances of her society‐lady career. In the department of new series, CBS has “Working Stiffs,” which is being given a “special preview” tomorrow night at 8. Directed by Penny Marshall, the Laverne of “Laverne and Shirley,” the first episode introduces the incompetent O'Rourke brothers, played by Jim Belushi (no, not that Belushi—his brother) and Michael Keaton. Losing one job after another, the O'Rourkes retreat to their rich uncle's business: They are hired reluctantly. They mess up things inevitably. One long scene, on the ledge of an office building, is an almost intact steal from an old Harold Lloyd comedy. Flung into the surreal atmosphere of ethnic sit‐corns, Irish Roman Catholics might well consider demanding equal time for retribution. “A New Kind of Family” makes its debut Sunday at 7:30 P.M. on ABC. Two women discover that they have rented the same house in Los Angeles. One (Eileen Brennan), a widow from New York has three children, the oldest 15. The other woman (Gwynne Gilford), divorcee, has a 13‐year‐old daughter. The first episode is preoccupied with establishing characters and situation. Needless to say, the two women decide to set up a joint household. There are encouraging moments, such as when, discovering no coffee in the cupboard, the Brennan character snarls, “That's the trouble with L. A. — the people aren't nervous enough.” The series was created by two women, Margie Gordon and Jane Eisner. The first episode was directed neatly by Jim Burrows. Also on Sunday, NBC is devoting all of its prime‐time schedule, from 8 to 11 P.M., to Bob Hope and “The Road to China.” Carol Burnett plays an unwed mother in “The 10th Month” on Sunday, 8 P.M., on CBS."
House to Get Education Dept. Plan,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/15/archives/house-to-get-education-dept-plan-budget-and-personnel.html,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 14 — Stripped of antibusing, anti‐abortion and pro‐prayer amendments, a compromise proposal to create a Cabinet‐level department of education will reach the floor of the House of Representatives next week for what is expected to be another lively debate. The compromise, in which controversial House amendments were dropped, was reached late yesterday by SenateHouse conferees. If approved by both Senate and House, the measure would be sent to the White House. The major battleground is expected to be the House, which had attached the antibusing, anti‐abortion and pro‐prayer amendments to the bill by margins of at least 2 to 1 last July. The Senate version included no such crippling amendments. The proposed new department, President Carter's principal Government reorganization effort this year, has generated lukewarm support and strong opposition in some quarters. The bill won House approval by a vote of 210 to 206, while it was passed in the Senate by a vote of 72 to 21. Budget and Personnel Stripped of the House amendments, the compromise bill would create the new department with an initial budget of about $14.1 billion and 17,400 employees. The nucleus of the new department would be the current Office of Education, now part of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Also shifted to the new department would be the Defense Department's schools for overseas dependents; the Agriculture Department's graduate school; the Labor Department's migrant education program; college housing loans now administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and certain science programs now run by the National Science Foundation."
One‐Man Bridge?,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/16/archives/oneman-bridge-trudeau.html,"HOW sweet it was to be in Canada in 1968. The afterglow of the previous year's joyous celebration of the centennial of Canadian confederation still suffused a country that seemed at last to have shed its reputation for national grayness. By comparison with the United States— and in Canada it is an imperative comparison — Canada was a blessed place. The economy was booming. Race riots, political assassinations, the Vietnam War might bring chaos Detroit and Los Angeles, but they were merely distant thunder in Toronto and Montreal. There was only one storm cloud on the Canadian horizon, the nagging question of French‐speaking Quebec's place in the confederation; but in the spring 1968, that too seemed capable of resolution. For Canada had Just chosen a new Prime Minister, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, an erudite, debonair French-Canadian whose fluent bilingualism and bicultural ancestry seemed to provide a one‐man bridge across the gulf of Canada's two solitudes. Since then, Canada's bright vision has darkened. The radical fringe of Quebec's independence movement brought political murder to a stunned nation. Since the election of a separatist Government in Quebec in 1976, the Canadian confederation has grown increasingly brittle. Both Pierre Trudeau, the self-confident “philosopher‐king” of a decade ago, and the Liberal Party he heads have been thrown out of office. It is this transition that Rick Butler and Jean‐Guy Carrier seek to illuminate in their collection of editorial commentary from publications in Canada and abroad. Within the limits necessarily imposed on any such anthology by the editors’ own political inclinations — Mr. Carrier is a former functionary for Canada's socialistic New Democratic Party — and the restrictions of space, they have provided a fascinating flashback. The fascination comes at two levels. On the surface there is a cogent outline of how Canadian commentators — both French and English — changed their views of Mr. Trudeau throughout the stormy decade. At first they applauded the unexpected emergence of dashing leader who embodied the good things that Canadians like to think their country stands for: reason, equal opportunity, youth, a concern for less-fortunate mankind and the ability to find a middle way in all disputes. They reveled in recounting examples of his mordant wit, for instance, his reply to an assistant who inquired, “What shall we do, Sir, about the Abortion Bill?” “Pay it,” snapped Pierre Trudeau. But, as Canada entered the 1970's, that impression began to change. The perennial Anglo‐Canadian question — What does Quebec want? — seemed to be no nearer an answer despite, or perhaps because of, Mr. Trudeau. His harsh imposition of the War Measures Act to deal with terrorism in Quebec in 1970 briefly consolidated his standing among conservative Cana- dians but was soon followed by criticism that perhaps he and his colleagues had made a bad situation disastrous. The 1973‐74 oil crisis and the subsequent setbacks to the Canadian economy sent Mr. Trudeau's popularity plummeting. The backlash in English Canada to the Government's insistence on bilingualism in such mundane areas as soupcan labels intensified enough to test Mr. Trudeau's patience on occasion. An editorial in The Observer, the distinguished British weekly, reported that “when a politician from Western Canada complained about having to look at the French on his packet of breakfast cereal, Trudeau told him brusquely: ‘Turn the damn .’ “ Beneath the surface, the Butler‐Carrier compendium provides a less obvious insight into the shortcomings of Canadian journalism. As they write in their summation: “The Prime Minister's marriage has received more press coverage than individual rights, poverty or foreign ownership [of Canadian resources and industry]. ... Overall this problem is less noticeable in Quebec where it is easier to find thoughtful, issueoriented and well‐researched feature articles and editorials.” The collection stops short of Mr. Trudeau's election defeat this year, and for that reason it has something of the air of a work in progress. The final chapter has yet to be compiled. Will it show a resurgent Pierre Trudeau spurting out of enforced retirement to do wonderful things for his country? Mr. Butler's and Mr. Carrier's selections would seem to argue that this is unlikely. Trudeau supporters would respond that he remains the unique man able to solve Canada's unique problems. Mr. Trudeau himself, if asked the question, would probably merely shrug. ■"
LETTERS TO THE WESTCHESTER EDITOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/16/archives/westchester-weekly-letters-to-the-westchester-editor-the-politics.html,"I chuckled when I read the article “Abortion Bill: Debate On” [Aug. 26]. To quote Polly Rothstein of the prochoice persuasion, the Right to Life Party is a “fanatical minority” and “single‐issue parties . .. traditionally go nowhere.” In 1854, a group of one‐issue fanatics — abolitionists — formed a one‐issue party called Republican. I am a personal friend of Robert D. McKeon, Elizabeth Costanzo, and all the other “fanatics” you interviewed for your article. Funny, I never thought of myself — or them — in that light before. I always regarded us as just plain middle‐class folks trying to keep America proud and beautiful. The ugliest pollution — the most deadly; the most destructive — is that which pollutes men's minds. The “prochoice” people neglect to mention one very important fact: once a young woman is pregnant the choice has already been made! ANN O'GRADY The Bronx Abortion: There Is No Stopping It Elizabeth Costanzo of the Right to Life Coalition of Lower Westchester is quoted as saying [Aug. 26] that an amendment to the Constitution outlawing all abortions, which is their group's ultimate goal, will “protect life from fertilization to natural death.” If, in fact, outlawing abortion would actually stop abortion, I could at least see their point, although I'd still strongly disagree. But there is no stopping abortion, there's only making it a dangerous operation and a criminal offense. It's interesting to note that it's only legal abortion that inflames these zealots to action — There was no Right to Life nationally until the Supreme Court legalized abortion, even though an estimated one million women each year chose to take the necessary risks to terminate a pregnancy. It's easy to see through the “protect life” rhetoric and translate it into “punish women.” ROSA M. CALABRESE Hartsdale Religion Isn't The Issue Thank you for the coverage of some of our activities on behalf of the unborn in the Westchester Weekly of Aug. 26. However, we fail to see the importance of the religion of the legislators who will be voting on the parental notification‐informed consent bill on abortion now before the County Legislators. What is noteworthy is the fact that the expected vote of 12‐5 will be a bipartisan vote. Incidentally, one of the legislators who is expected to be one of the five voting against the bill, Carolyn L. Whittle, was heard on local radio this past week talking about the importance of making an “informed choice” in an energyrelated matter. Is energy a more important resource than human life?

U.S. CITIES ENTREAT POPE TO VISIT THEM,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/16/archives/us-cities-entreat-pope-to-visit-them-officials-at-vatican-rule-out.html,"ROME, Sept. 15 — Last‐minute pleas from such cities as Baltimore and Milwaukee are still arriving in the Vatican, entreating Pope John Paul II to depart from his official itinerary in the United States and visit those cities, if only briefly. Officials at Vatican Rule Out Side Trips but Say Minor Changes in Itinerary May Be Made However, the Pontiff's schedule for his Oct. 1‐7 sojourn 7 is already so crowded that he will hardly get more than a few hours’ rest each day. Small changes in the program are still possible, Vatican officials say, but they rule out any side trips. American churchmen here are discussing how the cities that the Pope will visit were chosen. Why will he stop over in Des Moines? Why won't he go to Detroit, with its large Roman Catholic population and its strong Polish‐American community? Did the small team of American and Vatican officials, ecclesiastics and laymen, keep in mind that the number of Spanish‐speaking Catholics in the United States is rapidly growing, and that the Pope might want to acknowledge their presence and importance for the church? `Not Just a Polish‐American Affair’ An official who is helping to plan the journey was asked why Detroit had been left out of Pope John Paul's itinerary. “Why not Cleveland, why not Buffalo?” the source said, countering the question. “There are plenty of Poles in these cities, too, but the Pope's trip is not just a Polish‐American affair.” In the Middle West, the official explained, it was a choice between Chicago and Detroit. “Chicago was chosen because it's the second American city and has the best facilities for the Pope to meet with the United States hierarchy,” he said. Inevitably, there were rumors here that the Pontiff wanted to favor the Archbishop of Chicago, John Patrick Cardinal Cody, who is a conservative, over the Archbishop of Detroit, John Francis Cardinal Dearden, who has taken liberal positions on questions of ecclesiastical discipline. Pope John Paul himself has repeatedly affirmed traditional church teachings on such matters as divorce, abortion and the celibacy of the clergy. Vatican spokesmen would not comment on such speculation. Privately, informed churchmen say that the present Pope respects and likes Cardinal Dearden and will see him in Chicago. The official in charge of helping prepare the journey said that Des Moines had been selected for a short visit because the Pope “wanted to get a glimpse of rural America west of the Mississippi,” and Des Moines was considered the most convenient place. First Stop Will Be Boston Boston was chosen as the Pope's American point of arrival Oct. 1 from Ireland, it was explained, because he had lectured at Harvard as a Cardinal and was fascinated by the intellectual atmosphere. “He just wanted to revisit Boston,” the official remarked. That holds, as well, for Philadephia. When the Pope was Karol Cardinal Wojtyla, he attended the 41st International Eucharistic Congress in Philadelphia and liked the city. The Archbishop of Philadelphia, John Joseph Cardinal Krol, who is of Polish descent, was close to Cardinal Wojtyla and is understood to have led the movement in last year's conclave that resulted in the election of the first Polish Pope. It was obvious that the Pontiff would visit New York because he had been invited by the Secretary General of the United Nations, Kurt Waldheim, to address the General Assembly. Washington had to be included in the itinerary because President Carter had invited the head of the Roman Catholic Church to meet him, his family and his staff at the White House. Vatican officials said that Pope John Paul was aware of the role of Hispanic persons in present‐day Catholic life in the United States and would find occasion to stress it in appearances in New York and other cities. In Washington, the Pope is to meet with Latin American ambassadors at the offices of the Organization of American States. Second Trip to United States Due The Pope is expected to visit areas with strong Spanish‐speaking communities, especially in Florida and California, on a proposed second trip to the United States. The Vatican official who is coordinating the program and logistics of the forthcoming Papal trip is Bishop Paul C. Marcinkus. In all likelihood he will coordinate the projected second visit to the United States. He is an American who heads one of the Vatican's several financial bodies, the Institute for the Works of Religion — often unofficially called the “Vatican bank” —and he was in Pope John Paul's entourage earlier this year on journeys to Mexico and Poland. Bishop Marcinkus, who is 57 years old and a native of Cicero, Ill., served the much‐traveled Pope Paul VI as advance man, tour manager, troubleshooter and occasional bodyguard. Pope John Paul is understood to have taken Bishop Marcinkus's advice as to which cities he should visit on his first trip as head of the church to the United States. “As a Chicagoan, Bishop Marcinkus, of course, pushed Chicago,” an American priest here remarked. The Pontiff is scheduled to spend two days in that city and hold a meeting with the American bishops’ conference there. Role of Vatican U.N. Envoy Another key official involved in the Papal journey is the Vatican's representative at the United Nations, Archbishop Giovanni Cheli. He was just starting vacation in the Alps near the French border late in August when a phone call from his superiors in Rome summoned him back. He was instructed to fly to New York. Archbishop Cheli, who has the rank of Apostolic Nuncio, or Papal Ambassador, is in charge of all the details regarding the Pontiff's visit to the United Natiions."
Around the Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/18/archives/around-the-nation-nurses-vote-to-continue-rhode-island-hospital.html,"PROVIDENCE, R.I., Sept. 17 (AP) —Nurses at the Rhode Island Medical Center voted 74 to 20 today to continue their five‐day‐old walkout in defiance of a Superior Court back‐to‐work order. The nurses, who say the hospital is understaffed, met to consider a compromise proposed in Providence Superior Court at a hearing on the state's request that leaders of the nurses’ union be held in contempt of court for defying the backto‐work order. The strike at the Medical Center, which includes the Institute of Mental Health and the General Hospital, began Thursday. Other hospital employees are honoring the strike, and National Guardsmen and volunteers are caring for the 1,600 patients. High Court Asked to Hear Coast Takeover of Church WASHINGTON, Sept. 17 (UPI) — A coalition of religious and civil liberties groups today asked the United States Supreme Court to accept a petition by the Worldwide Church of God for review and reversal of California's takeover of the church. The coalition, including the American Civil Liberties Union and Americans United for Separation of Church and State, charged that the government and courts of California had violated the First Amendment by “taking over the total workings of the church.” The case, which church‐state separatists say could be the most significant in a century, stems from charges by dissidents of misuse of funds in the Pasadenabased 100,000‐member denomination headed by Herbert W. Armstrong. On Jan. 3, 1979, a court‐appointed receiver arrived at church headquarters to take control of its assets, operations and income, reported at about $70 million a year. The action was granted before any charges of fraud were proved or any indictments handed down. Family Planning Donation Results in Boycott of Airline By The Associated Press The Washington‐based American Life Lobby and the central New York Right to Life Federation, two groups opposing abortion, have initiated a nationwide boycott of United Airlines, contending that the company had made a $7,000 donation to Planned Parenthood. Officials from those groups vowed yesterday to continue the boycott begun over the weekend, despite assertions by United Airlines and Planned Parenthood that the donation had came from employees and was not a corporate gift. Don Bates, a Planned Parenthood vicepresident in New York, said that he believed the anti‐abortionists became convinced the donation was a corporate one because they misunderstood an article about it in Planned Parenthood newsletter published last spring. The article announced the donation by airline employees and quoted Winston E. Forest, identified only as a “vice president,” as praising the donation. Mr. Forest is actually Planned Parenthood's vice‐president for resources, Mr. Bates said. Bus Strike Ends on Coast, At Least for a While LOS ANGELES, Sept. 17 (UPI) —Striking bus mechanics agreed today to temporarily end their 23‐day‐old walkout. The agreement calls for a pay increase of more than 35 percent. The vote was 378 to 250. Officials of the Southern California Rapid Transit District said that its buses, which carry about 1.2 million riders a day, would roll again tomorrow morning. But there was still the possibility that the strike would resume next month. The mechanics said they would walk off their jobs again if negotiators could not agree during the next three weeks on a dispute over a proposal to subcontract some emergency work."
A Colloquy on the Sanger Spirit,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/18/archives/a-colloquy-on-the-sanger-spirit.html,"The Domestic Relations Code in Georgia begins with a law stating that the husband is the head of the family and the wife is subject to him. That means that in Georgia today the family house belongs to the husband, no matter who makes the payments. In Alabama, the father not only legally owns all the household property but is automatically the legal guardian of his children. A state court awarded a father damages in the death of a child he had not supported for years. Although these and many other laws are clearly unconstitutional, according to Roxanne Conlin, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Iowa, they are still being upheld by the courts throughout the United States. Miss Conlin cited the examples in a speech to more than 400 at Rockefeller University last Friday. The occasion was the 100th anniversary of the birth of Margaret Sanger, the birth control pioneer, and the idea was a colloquy on the “ambiguities engrossing women today.” But both the audience and the panel, including Miss Conlin, the authors Michael Harrington, Elizabeth Janeway and Nora Ephron, and the black activist Jewell Jackson McCabe, were less interested in ambiguities than in the very real and unequivocal success of what Mr. Harrington called “the antiwomen's movement women's movement.” The long‐time socialist drew a gasp from the largely female crowd when he commented that his travels had convinced him that the anti‐abortionists’ “right‐to‐life” movement is “one of the few genuine social movements of the 1970's.” He was referring, he said, to the movement's success in capturing an ideal and mobilizing people in support of it. If the tone of the evening was any indication, women's rights activists are worried that their own movement lacks that kind of vitality. Speaker after speaker commented on the momentum of the forces opposed to the equal rights amendment. May Newberger, a State Assemblywoman from Long Island, stood up and said that she was one of 14 state legislators on an anti‐E.R.A. “hit list.” Mrs. Mccabe admitted that black women, especially professionals, had trouble accepting the feminist label or fighting for women's rights when they felt so little progress had been made in achieving black equality. Miss Ephron deplored the passivity of young women today. “I'm afraid that with all this ‘engrossing’ and the personal side of life,” she said, “we lose sight of the unambiguous issues like equal pay, welfare and day care.” Calling the threat to abortion rights “real, real serious,” Miss Conlin said that most of the Supreme Court's decisions since it held in 1973 that abortion was constitutional had not been “pro‐choice.” Of the participants, only Mr. Harrington seemed to have an analysis of why the women's movement, and the right to abortion, were in such difficulty. Appropriately enough, it involved Margaret Sanger. He reminded the audience that the woman who founded the first birth control clinic in America began her career as a socialist and came to believe in family planning as a result of being a nurse among poor women on the Lower East Side. “She saw issues in a broad social context, which suggests what we have to do today,” Mr. Harrington said. “We're entering a recession, whose consequences will be not only unemployment but increased social pathology, alcoholism, drug addiction, family breakup, and teen‐age pregnancy. We're about to increase the misery of blacks, browns, the young and the female. We can't solve the problems of women's rights and reproductive rights unless we're also concerned about that; about full employment, poverty, racism, and economic decay in the United States. Advocates of women's rights and population control have to be part of wider coalitions on those issues.” The colloquy was sponsored by the Planned Parenthood Federation of America Inc., an organization that grew out of Mrs. Sanger's birth control movement. Planned Parenthood calls itself the largest voluntary planning organization in the country, with 186 affiliates in 43 states. Last year it provided family planning services to more than 1.2 million people, largely from low‐income families. Its programs also include research on contraception, lobbying for family planning services and abortion rights, sex education, and special projects aimed at reducing teen‐age pregnancy. Mrs. Sanger, who died in 1966 at the age of 86, headed the International Planned Parenthood Federation until well into her 70's. After a radical youth, during which she was jailed more than once for publishing birth control information and opening her clinics, she evolved into an elegant matron. In later years she married a wealthy businessman and urged the socially prominent to join in backing birth control. After hearing the call for social change, the crowd at Rockefeller University, including the actress Myrna Loy, paid tribute to that side of Mrs. Sanger as well, and toasted her memory at a champagne reception."
"For One 19‐Year‐Old, a Third Abortion",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/19/archives/for-one-19yearold-a-third-abortion-i-just-cant-keep-on-destroying.html,"‘I just can't keep on destroying babies’ Cheryl is 19 years old and was about to have her third abortion the other day at the Eastern Women's Center. She had the first one when she was 17 and about to be graduated from high school. Seven months later, she had a second one. “This is the longest time I have gone between abortions,” she said. As Cheryl, who did not want her last name divulged, sees it, she has become pregnant because she has been unable to find a suitable form of contraception. “It's my fault,” she said. “I have used contraception — the pill. But I forget to take them. After all, I don't take vitamins or anything else every day so there's nothing to remind me. I want something that's safe and not too difficult to use.” To the suggestion that the man might take some responsibility for contraception, she responded, “My boyfriend has said that maybe he could withdraw. He says next time.” All of Cheryl's pregnancies were fathered by a 26‐ year‐old automobile mechanic with whom she has had a long‐term relationship. “Each time this happened to me, he wanted to get married and have the kid,” Cheryl said. “He tried to talk me out of the abortions. At first I was tempted, but I wasn't even out of high school, and ‘I couldn't imagine what I would do with that poor kid. I tell him that I will get married someday but now I'm working and enjoying myself.” Cheryl, who lives with her parents and five brothers and sisters in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, entered Kingsborough Community College last year. “I had a job, too, and running here and there made me always late for classes, so I decided to leave college, work and save enough money to go full‐time.” She now earns $171 a week as a clerk for an insurance company and plans to enter another college next fall to study accounting. Throughout the conversation, Cheryl said that she had never been plagued by doubts about abortion. “I accept the fact that I'm coming here. I think it all through before I make appointments. It's not an easy thing to do, and I don't think people should use abortion just because it's handy.” Still, when asked whether she considered an 8‐week‐old embryo to be a human being, she said, “I feel it's a baby all the way, so there is a little guilt.” And if she were to become pregnant again? “No matter what, I would have it. Three abortions is the limit for me,” she said. “I just can't keep on destroying babies. After all, my mother didn't destroy me,” she said. To bolster her resolve, she said, she is having her third abortion under local anesthetic instead of the general anesthetic she had had in the past. “I want to be awake during this one, I want to see how it feels, to feel the pain. Maybe that will convince me not to come back again.” NADINE BROZAN “I feel comfortable and calm. I have no regrets at all. But in six or eight months I will look back and think, ‘My child would have been born now.’ I write the date down on the calendar in a code that only I can understand. I guess that in a. way I feel sad.""."
The Abortion Repeaters,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/19/archives/the-abortion-repeaters-abortion-repeaters-conferees-ask-why-first.html,"ALMOST two of every five women having an abortion in New York City have had one before — or two, or four, or five, or, in one exceptional case, 14. Who is responsible tor this abortion‐repeater syndrome? Has the patient refused to use birth control or was she careless using it? Did her abortion counselor fail to explain clearly all the contraceptive choices? Did she understand how to use the one she chose properly? Or is society with its new moral codes to blame? Such were the questions raised at a conference held earlier this week to help abortion counselors, nurses and family planning specialists deal more effectively with their own ambivalent feelings and with the problems of their patients. The meeting, which attracted 182 participants from as far away as Cleveland and Washington, was co‐sponsored by the Eastern Women's Center, an out‐patient abortion service and the department obstetrics and gynecology of New York Hospital‐Cornell Medical Center. “The staff becomes frustrated and depressed when they see patients again and again,” said Grace O'M. Sullivan, director of the family planning and abortion clinic at New York Hospital. “They wonder why anybody would get into this predicament again, why their best intentions and efforts were rejected?” “You feel a sense of failure,” said Linda Scarfone, a nurse in the hospital's abortion unit. “You've counseled them, in our case given them free birth control, and you're not getting through to them. But then you realize that it may not really be their fault: it's traumatic for everyone.” Although many professionals expressed frustration with the patients they see more than once, they all solidly agreed that the woman herself could not be held culpable, and that until there are better methods of birth control, repeat abortions will continue to be necessary. The rising rate of repeat abortion is not due to the abandonment of contraception, said Dr. Christopher Tietze, senior consultant with the Population Council. “More women have already had a first abortion, so more women are at risk,” he said. “Nobody advocates abortion as an overall policy for the management of fertility,” said Terry Beresford, president of the National Abortion Federation. “Nobody loves it‐ not the people seeking it, not the nurses, nor the doctors, nor the counselors, but until we have better contraception, early and good sex education, easy access to the health care system and more sensitive counseling, we will still need abortions and repeat abortions.” In an effort to find out why women subject themselves to multiple abortions, Mrs. Sullivan and her staff conducted an informal study last year of 40 repeat patients at New York Hospital. Of the 1,526 abortions performed there, 701 were repeats. “We asked the 40 women ‘Why are you here again? Didn't you use birth control? Did it not work? What happened?'” said Mrs. Sullivan. “Each one had what was to her a valid reason. For some it was a problem with the relationship, for some nonuse or failure of a contraceptive. “For some it was gross misinformation ‐ adolescents thought if they had been pregnant once before, they were immune. Some women over 90 thought they could no longer conceive even though they had not undergone menopause. Some were afraid of contraception because of all the bad publicity the pill has gotten. Some people cited inflation saying that, in this economy, they could not afford the children they already had.” According to Dr. Michael B. Bracken, who is director of the perinatal epidemiology unit at Yale University Medical School and who has interviewed several thousand women in New York and New Haven: “The key issue in repeat abortion is whether the availability of the procedure has decreased the motivation to practice contraception.” “In fact,” he added, “women seek repeat abortions not because they are poorly motivated to use contraception but because the available contraceptive technology is inappropriate to their particular life situations.” As an example, he described “the woman who is told not to use the pill by her physician, and doesn't want to have an I.U.D. Her partner won't use a condom or withdraw, so she quickly exhausts the smorgasbord of choices.” Does having two or more abortions jeopardize a woman's chances of bearing a healthy child later on? The question is often raised in discussion of abortion's risks, and it is a worry that particularly troubles adolescents and young women. Dr. Fritz Fuchs, professor of reproductive biology at New York HospitalCornell University Medical College, said that although it is too early to reach final conclusions, “immediate complications can often be cured before the next pregnancy and the effect of long‐term complications on future pregnancies seems to be limited. There may be some consequences, but there ‘do not seem to be any major health hazards.” According to preliminary findings of a World Health Organization study in eight European cities that has yet to be analyzed, “There seem to be only minor increase in long‐term complications such as premature delivery, late miscarriages and low‐birth‐weight infants,” Dr. Fuchs said. Of immediate complications, he said, the most common was laceration of the cervix. Other problems that occur include pelvic infections ‐ sometimes considered to cause subsequent infertility ‐ lacerations of the uterine wall, and other cervical or vaginal problems. Dr. Fuchs said that dilitation of the cervix was probably more responsible for damage than any other step of the procedure. And the psychological impact? Is the woman who allows herself multiple abortions unbalanced in some way to begin with? Do repeat patients tend to suffer more guilt or sadness after several abortions than after one, if indeed they have serious regrets at all? Those questions proved to be the most controversial and difficult of the day. Many attending thought that the need to become pregnant without actually wanting a child reflected some other Imresolved conflict. “Studies show that women use pregnancy subconsciously to replace some‘thing else; for some it's a cry for help,” Mrs. Sullivan said. Although he did not focus specifically on women who have more than one abortion, Dr. Lawrence Downs, assistant professor of psychiatry at the New York Hospital‐Cornell University Medical Center, found in a study comparing 100 married mothers having babies with 200 abortion patients that by and large women choosing abortion were “overwhelmed with stress.” “The abortion patients were more depressed, anxious and impulsive than the married mothers,” he said. He added that substantially greater numbers of abortion patients had experienced within the year preceding the conception stresses in five categories: (Meath or dying of a member of the immediate family. (Moss other than by death of a longstanding love relationship. qNeed for help from a psychiatrist or psychologist or prescription of .a psycologically helpful drug by a physician. qMajor gynecological problems. qAn unstable life situation in which the individual had experienced three or more changes in job, school or residence. One‐quarter of the 200 abortion patients had already had what Dr. Downs called “precedents,” an earlier undesired pregnancy. “Of those women having two or more abortions, 56 percent had had two or more stresses,” he said. “When a counselor sees a woman who is inundated with stress, they ought to discuss what being pregnant means to her.” Other participants contended that there are no psychological characteristics peculiar to the repeat abortion patient. Although Dr. Bracken agreed that a history of four or five abortions might be symptomatic of some inner conflict, he said he did not view the repeat patient as different in any way from any other women. “Counselors, like psychologists, tend to look for problems,” he said. “When you compare women having repeat abortions with women having first abortions or those delivering babies, their basic personality make‐up is no different. The counselors are seeing a reactive anxiety due to the abortion itself, but it is not a reflection of that woman's basic personality.”"

Fundamentalist Christian Unity in Politics Sought,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/20/archives/fundamentalist-christian-unity-in-politics-sought.html,"PASADENA, Calif. Sept. 18 — More than 2,000 Christian ministers are scheduled to receive a letter from Pasadena soon giving the voting records of all United States senators and representatives on abortion and legislation dealing directly or indirectly with homosexuality, pornography, “anticommunism” and a variety of other issues. The nationwide mailing, a so‐called report card on “moral issue” voting, will mark the opening of efforts by a 10month‐old organization here to elect conservative candidates and defeat liberals in the 1980 elections as well as to lobby permanently in behalf of conservative causes. The organization, called Christian Voice, says it hopes to mobilize the political power of what it says is a voting bloc that has been largely ignored — the nation's millions of fundamentalist Christians. It says it hopes to raise at least $2 million to distribute to candidates it favors in next year's elections as well as turn out workers to help candidates it favors and defeat those it opposes. “The churches have been so passive politically for so long that we're losing the nation by default simply by not doing anything,” said the Rev. Richard Zone, operations manager of Christian Voice, which, he said, could be described as having a “right‐wing” orientation. Mr. Zone asserted that many Americans disagreed with society's newly liberalized treatment of homosexuality, prostitution, drug use, pornography and other matters but had had little opportunity to express their opposition in an effective political way. “For too long, we've been silent; we're trying to change that,” he said. ‘A lot of Christians have been paying their taxes to support things that they are truly against; they're fed up; the purpose of Christian Voice is to say, ‘We can change things,'” Mr. Zone said. “It's time that Christians got together and lobbied like all the special interest groups.” In the past, he said, officers of most churches were reluctant to become involved in political debates affecting issues of morality because they feared losing their tax‐exempt status, or when they did act, it was usually on only a single issue, such as abortion. Christian Voice, he said, will have a broad‐based interest in many issues and has not sought a tax exemption; therefore, contributions to its program are not deductible. Although many of the issues upon which the organization says it intends to lobby, such as opposing candid sex education and favoring prayer in the public schools, are ones that fundamentalist religions have long been associated with, some of the issues are of a more political nature and are favorite conservative causes. For example, Mr. Zone said the group would lobby . against recent American policies toward Zimbabwe Rhodesia and Taiwan, which he asserted represented an abandonment of Christian traditions, and it opposes ratification of the strategic arms limitation treaty with the Soviet Union Asked what protesting the proposed treaty had in common with the group's opposition to abortion and homosexuality, Sandra Ostbyu, an administrator of the organization, said: “We feel the SALT II agreement would put us in such a weakened state that we could be blackmailed into anything; it's part of our attitude toward godless communism. SALT compromises America in favor of Communists.” The organization said that about 130,000 persons had enlisted in it since mailings announcing the formation began going out from the Christian Voice offices in a downtown Pasadena office building late last year."
Books: The Smiling Popes Story,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/21/archives/books-the-smiling-popes-story-films-by-independents.html,"THE REV. ANDREW GREELEY says he set out to do the popes as Theodore H. White has done Presidents, presenting a history in which he is himself passionately involved. The White model works pretty well, freeing the author to present an account of last year's doings in Rome, which, for all its unambiguous partisanship, tells us more about the election of two popes (and the future of the church) than less knowing reporters ever could. Father Greeley is a priest and a sociologist, as well as a journalist. He knows more than most journalists about the way things are in the church and cares more than many about the way they ought to be. That helped him work hard. He not only gathered gossip (which is the best description of what reporters do at the Vatican, where, he maintains, you can't believe anything the official spokesmen say). But he also lobbied, along with other agents of change in the church, for a new kind of pope. Father Greeley thought the world didn't need another Paul VI, “a grim, stern, pessimistic, solemn‐faced pope who did not appeal to the world as man who is really possessed by the ‘good news’ he claims to be teaching.” He wanted “a hopeful holy Man who smiles” — the kind of man “whose faith makes him happy and whose hope makes him joyful.” And so, Father Greeley went to Rome last summer to see whether and how the cardinals would pick such a man. This account of how they did so, in diary form, is waggish and worldly. Thus, one curial cardinal, Giovanni Benelli, is “an H. R. Haldeman in the Vatican.” By contrast, the American delegation of cardinals is a nescient bunch who tell the press that the major problem of their church is “the influx of Spanish immigrants.” Father Greeley, armed with unassailable survey statistics, apostrophizes them: “Eighty‐five percent of your people reject the church's birth control teaching, two‐thirds turn their backs on its divorce doctrine, Catholics and Protestants show virtually no difference in abortion attitudes, vocations are less than a third of what they were a decade and a half ago, less than twofifths believe in papal infallibility, less than half go to church on Sundays, a new wave of virulent anti‐Catholcism is sweeping the country — and your biggest problem is immigration!” But Father Greeley gets his wish in Rome, not once, but twice. Somehow, the cardinals elect first one, then another “hopeful holy man who smiles.” He confesses that he didn't know it before he saw the white smoke, but both John Paul and John Paul II were his choices all along. “American Independents,” a series of 14 feature films made by independent film makers, will begin tomorrow and run through Sept. 27 at the Paramount Theater, Broadway and 61st Street.

Around the Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/22/archives/around-the-nation-use-of-boston-common-for-popes-visit-opposed.html,"BOSTON, Sept. 21 (UPI) — A plea by Bill Baird, the abortion rights advocate, to prevent the use of Boston Common for a restricted‐access mass by Pope John Paul II was taken under advisement today by Federal District Judge Walter Skinner. Mr. Baird's attorney, Joan Schmidt, argued that the city had no right to grant the Roman Catholic Archdiocese permission to conduct the Oct. 1 religious ceremony since church officials plan to restrict access on the Common near an elaborately constructed altar. “We have no quarrel with the church holding a religious ceremony in a cathedral or some other church,” he said. “What we protest is the church being allowed to restrict access to public property on the day of the mass.” John Keith, representing Mayor Kevin H. White, argued that the arrangement for the mass was basically an ecclesiastical decision, free of judicial scrutiny. Jury Reverses a Verdict In Capital Bribery Case PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 21 (AP) — A Federal jury yesterday found Joseph P. Yeldell and Dominic Antonelli not guilty of bribery and conspiracy charges stemming from an alleged plot to defraud the District of Columbia Government. Last October, a Federal jury in Washington took less than four hours to convict the two men. But District Court Judge Gerhard A. Gesell, who oversaw both trials, later declared a mistrial upon learning of irregularities in the jury selection process. The ruling for mistrial was subsequently upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and a new trial was ordered. Defense attorneys gained a change of venue to Philadelphia, arguing that the wide publicity that accompanied the trial in Washington made a fair second trial there impossible. The Government charged that Mr. Antonelli, a millionaire developer and parking lot owner, had bribed Mr. Yeldell, a former District of Columbia official, through a secret loan and other personal financial favors, in exchange for Mr. Yeldell's approval of a lucrative government lease on a building owned by Mr. Antonelli. Sewage Spill Kills Wildlife In Part of San Francisco Bay SAN JOSE, Calif., Sept. 21 (AP) — Much of the wildlife in the southern end of San Francisco Bay has been killed by sewage from a malfunctioning treatment plant here, state officials said today. “The southern tip of the bay is now a zone of total mortality,” said Michael V. Rudd, a state fish and game biologist. “Nothing is alive.” Mr. Rudd said that minnows he put in water taken from the area had lived only eight minutes. After trolling four miles of the bay Thursday, officials reported finding dead fish, dead shrimp and even dead birds. They said that the waste was heavily laced with floating organic matter, ammonia, chlorine and bacteria. Up to 50 million gallons of the waste continued to flow into the bay today, for the 16th day. Frank M. Belick, sewer plant manager, said it might take two weeks or more to get the plant operating properly. Plant technicians told reporters that the breakdown was in the biological treatment process that purifies the sewage. U.S. Judge at Trial in Texas Denounces the News Media BEAUMONT, Tex., Sept. 21 (UPI) — A Federal judge who shuffled reporters in and out of his courtroom at a drug smuggling trial took time out in final arguments to denounce the news media as unconcerned for “the betterment of society.” “It is of continuing consternation to this court that the news media seem to have no concern about whether a trial is fair or serves for the betterment of society,” District Court Judge Joe Fisher, 69 years old, said from the bench yesterday. Judge Fisher's remarks came during final arguments at the trial of the remaining 12 of 22 original defendants accused of conspiracy, racketeering and smuggling 88 tons of Colombian marijuana into Texas aboard shrimp boats. Thoughout the weeklong trial, Judge Fisher ordered reporters out of the courtroom during testimony, but allowed members of the general public to remain. With the press out, he permitted two defendants to plead guilty and similarly disposed of two defendants while sealing their records and refusing to explain whether they had pleaded guilty or had been dismissed. Husband Guilty of Raping His Wife in Massachusetts SALEM, Mass., Sept. 21 (AP) — A jury today convicted a 32‐year‐old man of raping his estranged wife, a conviction believed the first of its kind in Massachusetts. James J. Chretien was also convicted on a related burglary charge, but acquitted on a second charge of rape and a second charge of burglary. The maximum sentence on the rape charge is life. The burglary charge carries a minimum mandatory sentence of 10 years. Judge Thomas J. Morse Jr. of Essex County Superior Court scheduled sentencing for Monday. Mr. Chretien's 32‐year‐old wife, Carmellina, and their 9‐year‐old son, James Jr., were not in the courtroom for the verdict. The boy testified for about 15 .minutes yesterday as his parents watched and wept. He described an early‐morning argument between his parents at his mother's home in Haverhill last Feb. 8. The trial was the first of its kind in Massachusetts in this century. In a similar trial in the 1800's, the defendant was acquitted."

Miss Mitgang, a lawyer from Orinda, was elected to a two‐year term recently as head of the 45,000‐member group that works to promote female candidates and womens' issues.

Paperbacks: New and Noteworthy,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/23/archives/paperbacks-new-and-noteworthy.html,"FIELDS OF FIRE, by James Webb. (Bantam, $2.50.) A platoon of Marines makes its way through Vietnam's rice paddies and jungles, beset by the violent deaths, hideous injuries, miserable living conditions and feelings of aimlessness. Vividly, sometimes awkwardly narrated by a man who was there, this novel is one of the best works to come out of the war. HELLO, I MUST BE GOING, by Charlotte Chandler. (Penguin, $4.95.) The life of the late Groucho Marx, from his youth as a vaudeville performer to his last years as the living legend who bedazzled fans and a younger generation of comedians. Our reviewer, Joe Flaherty, thought that this tirelessly researched book was often repetitious and occasionally banal. SNOW WHITE. Translated by Paul Heins. Illustrated by Trina Schart Hyman. (Little, Brown/Atlantic, $3.95.) The classic tale of Snow White, the jealous stepmother and the seven dwarfs is freely and gracefully translated from the German of the Brothers Grimm and illuminated by many full‐color illustrations that emphasize the story's passion and drama. TO LOSE A BATTLE, by Alistair Horne. (Penguin, $5.95.) A graphic account by a British journalist of the ten days, May 10‐20, 1940, during which France fell to Hitler's Wehrmacht. The reasons for the catastrophe — the dry rot that developed in the Third Republic and its armed forces after World War I — are given their due in the early sections of this 1969 book now returned to print. THE AMBIVALENCE OF ABORTION, by Linda Bird Francke. (Dell, $2.75.) An estimated 1 million abortions are performed in America each year. Linda Bird Francke, a journalist and mother, interviewed a large sampling of women involved in the experience. Christopher Jencks, who reviewed this presentation of her findings and observations, said they would interest many readers but would change few opinions about the moral issues involved. INTERPRETATIONS AND FORECASTS: 19221972, by Lewis Mumford. (HBJ/Harvest, $5.95.) Twoscore essays, reviews and miscellaneous papers on literature, history, biography and contemporary society. Written over half a century, they all display the coherence of Lewis Mumford's special vision. George Levine called it “an immense and touching book [that] gives us a way to make our world comprehensible again.” THE FANTASY WORLDS OF PETERS. BEAGLE. (Ballantine/Del Rey, $5.95.) The worlds of Peter S. Beagle — a writer who has been praised in these pages for his “opulence of imagination” and “mastery of style” — are populated by such creatures as werewolves, unicorns and ghosts, as well as ordinary human beings who find themselves entranced or perplexed by what they experience there. This new collection contains two novels — “A Fine and Private Place” (1960) and “The Last Unicorn” (1968) — a novella, a short story and a self‐portrait by Mr. Beagle. MOZART, by Marcia Davenport. (Avon/Discus, $3.50.) This 1932 biography, again available in paperback, is a highly readable portrait of the composer. It pays ample attention to his youth as a child prodigy and to the color of 18th‐century European life. TRUE CONFESSIONS, edited by Florence Moriarty. (Simon & Schuster/ Fireside, $5.95.) “He drew me closer, and I did not draw away.” So runs the caption that accompanied the posed, airbrushed photograph reproduced above when it served as an illustration for a story in a 1920 issue of True Confessions magazine. “My Own Story of Love: Should a Woman Tell Her Husband All the Secrets of Her Past?” is one of 39 short stories from the files of the Macfadden “confessions magazines” — True Confessions, True Story, True Experience, True Romance, Secrets, True Love and Modern Romances — that Florence Moriarty, Macfadden's current editor in chief, has gathered for this large‐format paperback. They are filled with the sorts of phrases and situations that have been titillating teen‐agers, their mothers and their grandmothers since the magazines' birth, in 1919: “wanton kisses,” “one moment of passion that swept away all reason,” “flaming youth pitched into the abysses of sin and thralldom.” For good measure, the editor includes a sampling of the advertisements that framed the stories, plugs for miraculous cures for acne and devices to produce a large bustline or straighten a nose. “True Confessions: Sixty Years of Sin, Suffering and Sorrow” is fascinating for the light it sheds on our changing mores and entertaining as a memory‐stirrer or simply as a collection of camp. COUNTERSTROKE, by Andrew Garve. (Penguin, $1.95.) An out‐of‐work English actor concocts a scheme to impersonate a jailed anarchist and have himself released to satisfy the demands of a gang of terrorists‐kidnappers. Newgate Callendar enjoyed the way Andrew Garve developed the actor's role in this thriller but regretted that the suspense did not build and the ending was “rather perfunctory.” ■"
CAPITAL REPORT,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/23/archives/new-jersey-weekly-capital-report.html,"BEING a friend of Governor Byrne apparently means more than Just knowing a nice guy. Last week, Martin L. Greenberg, the Governor's former law partner, got a plush state job. Mr. Greenberg, who resigned from the State Senate last month, was hired to be general counsel of the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. The part‐time post will pay him $35,000 a year. When he resigned from the Senate, Mr. Greenberg announced that he would represent Golden Nugget Inc., which is seeking a state license to operate a gambling casino in Atlantic City. The turnpike job had been filled by Robert N. Wilentz, who earlier this summer was sworn in as Chief Justice of the State Supreme Court. Mr. Wilentz succeeded as the Chief Justice former Gov. Richard J. Hughes, who became a consultant with a Trenton law firm that represents another gambling casino company, Resorts International. Is there another Thomas A. Edison lurking in some small New Jersey town? Probably not, say officials of the state's Department of Labor and Industry, but there may be some inventors whose ideas go for naught because they lack financing. Most banks prefer not to become involved with untested inventions. Sometime this week, the state's Office for Promoting Technical Innovation, aided by a $250,000 kitty, may be making loans to one or more New Jersey inventors to help them develop new products. New Jersey, judging by the number of patents granted, has more inventors than any other state. The Office for Promoting Technical Innovation was set up some months ago. A few weeks ago, a special board of technical experts interviewed six inventors seeking a loan, and it is about to make a decision on who might be helped. The inventions described to the experts included a small boat that does not capsize when people stand up in it, a plastic wheelchair, new weight‐lifting equipment and a new process for storing medical X‐rays. • At a public hearing on a proposal to add initiative and referendum to the State Constitution, the Assembly Committee on State Government heard considerable discussion about the concept of giving citizens more voice in their government. But testimony from Sara Miller of Elizabeth about why she wanted “I and R” was more to the point. She wants to cut taxes. “Let me point out that 53 percent of our taxes go for schools,” she said. “Also, some of our tax money goes for painting green lines down the streets for St. Patrick's Day and for paying the man I saw sleeping at his desk at City Hall.” Initiative and referendum is a device that allows voters to propose and pass laws that Legislatures do not want or find politically distateful. Last year, California voters used it to cut taxes in that state in what widely became known as Proposition 13. The State Constitution would have to be amended before “I and R” could be used in New Jersey, and most legislators are opposed to the idea, even though many of them say they support it. It is too late to get such an amendment on this year's ballot, and so its Being a friend of the Governor often proves to be rewarding backers are aiming for the 1980 general election. The outlook is doubtful. Legislators who have kept “I and R” from coming up this year are more than likely to try to do it again in 1980. One of the few legislators openly against it is Assemblyman Albert Burstein, Democrat of Tenafly; at the public hearing last week, he said that it would “disrupt representative democracy” and could cause “chaos.” In some states that have “I and R,” special‐interest groups keep political waters in constant turmoil, pushing, for example, for anti‐abortion laws, for and against capital punishment and for laws repealing taxes. One witness at the hearing, Samuel Perelli of Cedar Grove, who heads a taxpayers' group, said that New Jersey voters would take more interest in elections if they had the right to propose and pass laws themselves. • Under a new law just signed by Governor Byrne, public‐school students who attack teachers must be expelled, pending a hearing before the local school board. Previously, students could not be expelled without prior hearings. Organizations representing the state's 100,000 or so public‐school teachers have been calling student violence a growing problem that officials have been unable to cope with satisfactorily. The new law provides that a student expelled for violence is entitled to a hearing before the school board within 21 days. • Gamblers planning to test their luck in the Atlantic City casinos might do well to spend $2.50 before doing so. The state's Casino Control Commission has printed the official rules in booklet form. The regulations contain some options that many gamblers may not know about, including one that allows a blackjack player who does not like his hand to fold it and get half his bet back. The booklet details rules and regulations concerning not only blackjack, but also craps, baccarat, roulette and the “Big Six” wheels. The booklets can be ordered by mail from the Casino Control Commission, 379 West State Street, Trenton, 08625. And don't forget to include a check or money order for $2.50. ■"
"SENATE, 69‐22, BACKS EDUCATION AGENCY",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/25/archives/senate-6922-backs-education-agency-but-carter-proposal-appears-to.html,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 24 (AP) — President Carter's proposal for a Federal education department breezed through the Senate today but faces an unexpectedly cool reception in the House of Representatives. The Senate voted, 69 to 22, for a compromise version, ignoring several senators’ assertions that removing education from the Department of Health, Education and Welfare could give i dera 1 officials too much control and lead to unwanted intervention in local matters. The President, calling the Senate action “a major step toward improved government efficiency,” said in a statement that the bill would “cut red tape, reduce manpower levels and save tax dollars” and that it would also mean “better services — with less bureaucratic control —for the state and local institutions who provide education in our country.” Problems Seen in House The proposal, for the 13th Cabinet‐level agency, was approved by the House this summer, 210 to 206. Its version included several controversial amendments, dropped in the compromise voted recently by a House‐Senate conference committee, that would permit voluntary school prayer and forbid racial or sexual quotas, using student fees for abortions and imposition of busing as a condition for Federal funds. After the amendments, which the Carter Administration opposed, were dropped, Representative Jack Brooks, Democrat of Texas, chief sponsor of the legislation in the House, said there could be new difficulty in winning passage of the compromise, “but we ultimately will win out.” In the Senate, Abraham A. Ribicoff, Democrat of Connecticut, said before the vote that consolidating Federal programs would save money and that the bill “will make no changes of any kind in substantive education law and policy.” However, Senator Harrison Schmitt, Republican of New Mexico, said he was disappointed that the Senate “insists on increasing the potential of Federal control of education when the wave of opinion is against Federal control of our lives, at least more control.” Senator S.I. Hayakawa, Republican of California, said the bill would create “a pantheon of doctors of education but not smidgen of good for the average student.”"
Judge Allows a Boston Park Mass,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/26/archives/judge-allows-a-boston-park-mass.html,"A Federal district judge ruled yesterday that a papal mass could be held on Boston Common, but more legal action was threatened in Des Moines. Pope John Paul II is scheduled to arrive in Boston from Ireland next Monday and will then visit New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Des Moines and Washington. In the Boston suit, Bill Baird, who advocates freedom of choice on abortion. contended that the Roman Catholic Church should be denied use of the Common because non‐Catholics would be excluded from an 18,000‐seat reserved section in front of the altar. But Judge Walter Jay Skinner refused to grant an injunction against the Pope's celebrating mass on the Common. “The delegation to the church of control over access to the adjacent section of the Common does not implicate any of the specific evils against which the Constitution erects a 'wall of separation between church and state,’ ” Judge Skinner said. In Des Moines, preparations were being made by the Iowa Civil Liberties Union to file a suit to prevent the Lenox School District, southwest of Des Moines, from closing classes on Oct. 4, when the Pope is scheduled to visit Des Moines. The group filed a suit Monday in Federal District Court to prevent the Polk County supervisors from giving county workers a paid holiday for the Pope's visit, contending that it violated a constitutional guartantee of church‐state separation. A hearing in that suit was set for tomorrow before Judge William C. Stuart. Steven Brown, executive director of the Iowa Civil Liberties Union, told a news conference that the group objected to the day off because some $50,000 in tax funds would be spent on holiday salaries and because it would deny county services to the four plaintiffs in the suit. Mr. Brown added that, while the Pope was a head of state, he was visiting Iowa primarily for religious purposes and the four‐hour visit to Des Moines would be given over almost entirely to celebrating mass."
"Now, a Better View Up in Central Park",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/27/archives/now-a-better-view-up-in-central-park-the-governor-came-through.html,"Elizabeth Barlow whispered like a successful conspirator to Parks Commissioner Gordon J. Davis yesterday during a dedication ceremony in Central Park. “You'll notice,” she said, “that there are four trees that are no longer there.” Mrs. Barlow, the administrator of Central Park, said that some improvements had to be done quietly for fear of stirring up opponents. “Cutting down trees is an issue that's as hot as abortion,” Mrs. Barlow explained to one who had overheard her remark. “There's always someone who'll say, ‘Don't kill that tree.’ But look at the magnificent view across the lake now without those trees.” Most of the improvements going on in the park now, however, are not undertaken so quietly. Mr. Davis likes to talk about several projects that are under way now because he is eager to attract new donors for additional works. “The more they see you doing,” he said, “the more they are available for a contribution.” Mr. Davis and Mrs. Barlow had just officiated at the ceremonies at the Ladies Pavilion, an open, ornamented Victorian structure on the edge of the lake that has been rehabilitated and painted a soft blue‐green with gold trim through a grant of $7,000 from the Arthur Ross Foundation. From the Ladies Pavilion near 75th Street and the west side of the park Mr. Davis pointed out a now rundown glory called Cherry Hill. “A Japanese angel appeared out of nowhere,” Mr. Davis said, “and offered us $150,000 to put cherry trees over there. We convinced him that we didn't need $150,000 worth of just cherry trees there, and he agreed that the money could also go for reactivating the fountain and refurbishing the whole area.” The donation was made by Ryochi Sasakawa, an 80‐year‐old former member of the Japanese Parliament. The Governor Came Through Mr. Davis headed for the Sheep Meadow. The area is closed off by a five‐foot chain‐link fence while a $368,501 project is under way to provide a new drainage and irrigation system for the 16‐acre range between 66th and 69th Streets. The Commissioner said, “We asked Governor Carey for this and he came through in May with $310,000.” Most of the rest of the money came from a massive James Taylor “Save the Sheep Meadow” concert last July 31. But it is those mass events that worry Mrs. Barlow. “There is park preservation on the one hand,” she said, “and there is public enjoyment on the other. You can't let them get too out of balance.” Mr. Davis and his group moved south to the soaring marble and bronze Maine Monument at Columbus Circle where workmen were busy. The monument to those who went down in Havana harbor on the battleship Maine is a series of three fountain basins with classical figures in marble and is topped by a bronze figure of Columbia. “The marble is worn, the fountain doesn't work and all the fingers are missing on the figures — there are 28 fingers missing,” said Joe Bresnan, the department's director of historic parks. Repairs will cost $432,836, all of which will come from the city's capital budget."
Teen‐agers Hope to Tell Pope of Gains by Religion,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/28/archives/teenagers-hope-to-tell-pope-of-gains-by-religion.html,"Seven teen‐agers agreed yesterday at a news conference that the main thing they wanted to convey to Pope John Paul II was that young Americans, after a period of some disaffection, are returning to religion with greater fervor. The New York that Pope John Paul II will see next week will not be the tourist's city, but it will not be the city most New Yorkers know, either. [Page B1.] “Looking for some kind of direction for the rest of their lives” was the way Maureen O'Keeffe, an Iona College freshman, phrased it. And Monica Johnson speculated that the Pope's visit might “ignite a fire” in the minds of youngsters who had drifted away from church, just as she once did because of her boredom with “the same old prayers and the same old music.” Miss Johnson is one of four teenagers who will act as escort to the Pope at the “Youth in Concert with Pope John Paul II,” a program that will feature the music of three high school bands and a choral group of teen‐agers from New York and Long Island. Some 29,000 teenagers are expected to be at Madison Square Garden Wednesday morning to see the Pope. The Pope is expected to ask questions of the escorts and they, in turn, may have an opportunity to speak to him. “I haven't thought about what to say to him,” Miss Johnson said, adding that she was considering something like “What do you think of New York? And what did you get out of all this, really?” Ray Carrasco, another escort, said he would like to ask about “the abortion issue.” “Why does he feel so strong about it? “ the teen‐ager asked.“In my parish in Brooklyn some people cannot have more kids. They cannot afford to feed the kids they have.” It is rumored that the Pope may receive a guitar when he meets with the Catholic teen‐agers amid sounds of disco, salsa, soul and folk music, but Miss O'Keeffe, at the news conference in the offices of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, would only say that the three gifts that are planned, chosen after “a brainstorming session” of the 19‐member committee, would be “symbolic” of the Pope and of youth."
A Parish Priest Enjoys Not ‘Playing God’ Any More,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/29/archives/a-parish-priest-enjoys-not-playing-god-any-more-fighting-for.html,"The parish spire still seems to tower authoritatively over the striving‐class homes of Ozone Park, Queens, but the pastor, the Rev. Eugene M. Lynch, can lean back in the rectory of St. Miry Gate of Heaven and celebrate a quiet, enormous change — “I don't have to play God any more.” Thus does Father Lynch summarize the basic shift in the everyday life of religion on the parish level: the people's easing of intense dependence on endless appeals to priestly authority. After recent years of dwindling parish enrollment, he is delighted at the newer sight of Roman Catholics more willing to decide things for themselves, and his style as a pastor is to invite more of it. “Oh, you miss not being Big Daddy, playing God,” he says self‐mockingly after 25 years as a priest. “But all of us together in the parish are smarter than any one of us. The people are intelligent and they're taking leadership roles now.” Father Lynch found a politic way not to play God this week. Heading off potential enemies by the flock, he decreed that the few dozen tickets allotted to the parish for the papal visit next week would be awarded by a lottery based on the donation envelopes at the Sunday masses, and not on his personal choosing. “I could scalp the tickets and make some money,” the 51‐year‐old member of the Montfort Missionaries says, pleased with the extra zing that the papal visit, as distant as it will be, has put into the practice of faith at Gate of Heaven. Fighting for Identities The pastor pays John Paul II a high compliment: “The Pope is a politician; that's not a dirty word. He knows how to work a’ crowd. It's his nature; he's sincere.” Father Lynch has shown a certain political touch with a crowd, too. In the last two years his parish has rallied to a new identity in association with 25 other Queens churches, fighting together in the secular arena for their share of city services. In a grand extension of the church's sanctuary role, the parishes are fighting to preserve hardwon identities as clean, secure neighborhoods in a troubled urban borough. Rather than play God, Father Lynch has become a kind of insurgent clubhouse, leader, even bearding Mayor Koch last year at a civic rally as voters gathered under parish banners and demanded specific commitments and quickly shouted down any generalized political rhetoric. In similar fashion, typical parish life now has a church regular, Richard Kaiser, looking beyond the needs of his three parochial schoolchildren. He takes the time to monitor a flurry of real‐estate activity in the white neighborhood, to guard against the blockbusting tactics that have caused panic in other areas. At the same time, his wife, Barbara, is secretary at the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine —busy program of religious instruction for nonparochial students that has parishioners voluntarily doing the job that nuns once did before religious vocations faded. Changes Have Taken Place Fifteen years after a Pope first visited this nation, the parish is such quiet new blend of laity‐generated service and old verities that it is hard at first to notice any change in Gate of Heaven. There are 3,500 people “on the books,” Father Lynch says, estimating that about 1,500 are “fully active” in the parish. The streets seem set in the neat and humble ways of 1950's parish life as indulged by a predominantly ItalianAmerican community. Backyard grape arbors and frontyard madonnas still add touches of peasant beauty to the compact homesites of the parish. The neo‐Gothic church is rocklike on 101st Avenue facing a hamlet of storefronts that stand in gentle order: pasta maker, shoemaker, Democratic club, undertaker. But at closer inspection, it turns out the tidy convent no longer houses the eight nuns, Daughters of Wisdom, who teach at the school. They live in houses in the neighborhood with the people. The convent is home, instead, for young unmarried women who are pregnant tenants of the Birthright program that for 18 months now has offered services and not mere right‐to‐life rhetoric in the campaign against abortion. On a sunny morning, small children in parochial‐school plaid still cut across 104th Street to say hello to their pastor, and Father Lynch teases them and pats them on the head. And over on 103d Street, the cavernous, 53‐year‐old main church still affords as soothing candlelighted funeral as any mortal, believer or not, could want. “Come to me, all you who are weary,” one of the four parish priests says, slowly quoting Christ to a whitedraped coffin flanked by a small gathering of old people. “My yoke is easy, my burden light.” Activities for the Elderly But in the church hall, the first of 120 old people are beginning to gather for the daily seven‐hour program of social activities, easing the yoke with some gin rummy or a hot meal that Gate of Heaven began offering a year ago. This is a relatively radical corporal work by old parish standards, one demanded, Father Lynch says, by modern parishioners who find loneliness as valid a concern as the hereafter. Gate of Heaven still has the quiet taproot families, like that of Eileen Considine, a member of the Legion of Mary, a dependable believer who saw two of her sons ordained priests in the supposedly vocationless 1970's. And the parish still has younger people like Aurora Papa who, whatever the state of faith and love these days, must come home again — “back from Rosedale, the boondocks” — for a proper, whitegowned wedding at Gate of Heaven, where she once wore the parochial plaid. But the parish also has a laity‐generated interest in having Father Lynch prod insurance companies to find out whether they are really interested in containing the city scourge of arson or merely in passing on rate increases to the hard‐surviving neighborhoods. If anything, the parish shows even more of the past lately. Young Italian immigrants have been moving in for the first time in years. First Friday, a. devotion with the sweet rote of calendar obligation, has been revived like a golden oldie. And this summer 700 parishioners banded together to introduce a crowded, pungent parish street feast, complete with gambling wheels and a madonna procession — a communal, religious celebration previously unheard of in the 75‐year history of the parish. Differing Levels of Change At the same time, changes resulting from the modern emphasis on the individual are even more impressive. On simple level, Sister Anne Werner saw the last Pope at Yankee Stadium under her old‐church name of Sister Theodore of Jesus as part of a convent brigade dressed in 17th century habit — “the Dutch cleanser outfit,” Father Lynch says with a grin. This time the nun will go as herself, Anne Werner, complete with gray pixie haircut, and lead group of teen‐agers to a special conference for young people that the Pope has scheduled. On another level, the emphasis on individuality in the parish has seen small but striking phenomenon —broken marriages in which dissatisfied women leave housewifery behind. In an almost eerie way, as the pastor describes things, the issue of birth control, which once ignited so much controversy, is a silent one now at Gate of Heaven. Father Lynch barely recalls when he last sermonized on it and, again not playing God, he agrees that couples have taken it upon themselves to decide what to do, whatever the official warnings from Rome. He emphasizes the full context that respect for life should take, but he can see situations where circumstances lead a couple to birth control. As a Queens native who did an 11year stint in the foreign missions, Father Lynch senses a hopeful contentiousness in Gate of Heaven among parishioners who are fewer in number but stronger in faith. He has told them from the pulpit: “You know, you're not easy to deal with. You give me a hard time. But I give you a hard time.” He hopes for as much from the new Pope: “The Pope should show us his strength. He should challenge us.” But the pastor of Gate of Heaven does not forget the new parish spirit: “And we should challenge the Pope, too.” Students outside the administration building yesterday on the Wesleyan University campus.

House Approves Military Budget $2.8 Billion Under Carter Request,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/29/archives/house-approves-military-budget-28-billion-under-carter-request-tank.html,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 28 — The House of Representatives today approved $129.5 billion in military appropriations for the fiscal year that begins Monday, a sum $2.8 billion less than the Carter Administration requested but including a nuclearpowered aircraft carrier Mr. Carter does not want built. The vote was 305 to 49 for the bill, which will give the Defense Department the authority to commit funds for personnel, operations and maintenance, new weapons and matériel, and research and development. It goes now to the Senate. The House bill included $2.1 billion in additional funds to cover the cost of inflation and more expensive fuel, less than the $2.7 billion for which the Administration had asked. Altogether, the bill provides a 7.1 percent increase in military spending authority above the fiscal year 1979 , without counting the erosion in purchasing power caused by inflation. Among the disputed items in the bill are $2.1 billion for the Navy's large aircraft carrier, $670 million for the Air Force's mobile missile known as MX and $556 million for the Army's new main battle tank called the XM‐1. In another controversial section, the bill prohibits any funds from being used to perform abortions unless the life of the mother is in danger. That would apply to military women and dependents of servicemen being treated in military or civilian hospitals except at their own expense. The appropriations bill also contains $10 million to support the Olympic Games in Lake Placid, N.Y., next winter, $397,000 to promote rifle practice among civilians, funds to donate $25 “to each prisoner upon each release from confinement in military or contract prison and to each person discharged for fraudulent enlistment,” and money to raise the reward for apprehending a deserter or escaped military prisoner from $25 to $75. The quarrel over the aircraft carrier once again pits President Carter against Congress. At issue is a carrier similar to the U.S.S. Nimitz, which displaces 91,400 tons, steams at over 30 knots, carries 90 aircraft and requires a crew of 6,300. If built, it would be the fleet's fifth nuclearpowered carrier. Last year Mr. Carter vetoed a bill that provided for the carrier because he thought it too expensive. Congress eventually approved a bill without the funds for the ship. This year the Administration proposed spending $1.6 billion for a smaller oilfueled carrier displacing 62,000 tons, with a speed of more than 27 knots, carrying maximum of 64 aircraft and requiring crew of 4,100. Defense Secretary Harold Brown, evidently seeking a compromise, informed Congress recently that the Administration would accept a larger, conventionally powered carrier but remained opposed to the large nuclear‐powered ship. Critcism of the MX intercontinental nuclear missile has come from some military strategists who argue that it is not ‐needed, from liberals who contend that the money could be better spent on welfare programs, and from environmentalists who protest that it will tear up the countryside. Tank Has Engine Problems Each of the 200 missiles planned would be placed on a 20‐mile circular “racetrack” that would have shelters among which the missiles would be shuffled in an effort to reduce the risk of destruction by a direct hit in a Soviet attack. The Army's new tank has had engine problems. The bill provides that no more than $389.9 million will be made available to buy the new tanks until the Secretary of Defense certifies that it is reliable. Over all, the House version of the appropriations bill would give the Defense Department the authority to commit $41 billion for operations and maintenance, $34.9 billion to buy new weapons and matériel, $28.7 billion to pay and support personnel plus another $11.5 billion for retired persons and $13.3 billion for research and development."
Two Fundamentalists Crusade Against Abortion in 20 Cities,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/29/archives/two-fundamentalists-crusade-against-abortion-in-20-cities-feminists.html,"The films open with a scene of a young woman in a long white dress wallking slowly through a meadow with two beatific children. Suddenly, she halts to paint on an invislble canvas the question, “Whatever happened to the human race?” And then an invisible force shatters the words. What happened to The human race, according the Rev. cis A. Schaeffer, an evangelical theologian, and Dr. C. Everett Koop, aminent pediatric surgeon, is that it permitted abortion. And abortion, they say in the seminar they are taking to 20 cities this fall, has led to the disposal of defective babies by infanticide and that is inexorably leading toward euthanasia for the elderly These crusaders, Christian fundamentalists, exhort their listeners to remember that man is fashioned in the image of .God and that it is therefore surto take the life of a human being, before birth or after, for any reason whatsoever. The mood seems aimed at arousing evangelical Christians to action in a cause that in the past has been associated in the public mind with the Roman Catholic Church. Although not part of the mainstream right to life movement, Mr. Schaeffer and Dr.Koop clearly espouse many of its views and have earned its deep admiration. “'Every pro‐life supporter should see their program,” said Dr. Carolyn Gerster, president of the National Right to Life Committee. “We have even changed the date of our state convention in Arizona so as not to com pete with their appearange there.” Feminists Demonstrate Outside In the two-day presentation n held earlier this week in. the Felt Forum at Madison Square Garden, about 1,000 people watched five films, listened to lectures and participated in dicussions Many had paid $28 to attend abut, students .were admitted free. . Although Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen had urged the right to life department of the. Roman Catholic archdiocese here to promote the event, the audience seemed primarily drawn from the evangelical Protestant churches. Some people said they had been attracted by concern for the issues, others by admiration for Mr. Schaeffer. Few were aware that feminists and health rights advocates were demonstrating outside in favor of abortion rights. Mr. Schaeffer, whose followers call him “doctor” because of an honorary title conferred by the Gordon‐Conwell Theological Seminary in South Hamilton,Mass., has been described as an intellectual in the fundamentalist school of Protestantism. He was ordained in the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod, and since 1955 has led a religious study community called L'Abri in the Swiss Alps. He has also Written numerous books, including a new one that serves as a companion to the film and lecture series. The fact that he has lymphoma, a form of cancer, has not deterred him from making the strenuous tour. Why Doctor Joined the Cause Dr. Koop is surgeon in chief of the Koop Surgical Center, which was named after him, at Children's Hospital in Philadelphia. He is best known to the. public for separating the Siamese twin girls, Clara and Alta Rodriguez, in 1974. In his talks and appearances on film, he emphasizes . the number of operations he has performed to correct serious deformities in children. Askedin an interview why he had become so involved with this mission, he said, “One day when I was operating on three newborn babies, I realized that less than 100 feet away in the hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, they were destroying babies. Knowing what we can do with abnormal children, to know that We're destroying one million normal babies a year just drives me crazy.” All the seminar speakers agreed that abortion could never be condoned. When asked about conception during rape, Dr. Mildred F. Jefferson, a surgeon and president of the Right to Life Crusade, said, “We feel sympathy, but we can't restore a woman to a nonassaulted condition, and we don't know what the longterm effects of abortion might be. It might only add problems: The rape victim is not responsible for the assault, but she does become pregnant because of her biological capabilities. She has given that baby half of its qualities. If it were me, I would not give away my half.” They carry the message that it could lead to euthanasia for the elderly. The possibility of contraception as way, to combat abortion was never raised, though both Mr. Schaeffer and Dr. Koop said in conversations between sessions that they were in favor of it. From Abortion to Euthanasia Explaiging the links ;he seesbinding abortion to infanticide and being extended to euthanasia, Dr. Koop said: “The first domino to fall was abortion on demand, and it has split this country. as has no other social issue since the practice of slavery. The second domino to.. fall was infanticide. It fell silently because unlike abortion, which is a public issue, infanticide is practiced behind the shielding facade of the hospital. The third domino is euthanasia: it has been struck and is falling.” The evidence offered to show that infanticide is being practiced by medical professionals included a 1973 article in The New England Journal of Medicine in which two Yale professors cited case histories of parents forbidding treatment for their handicapped infants. The article gave the arguments on both sides of such decisions. Another source cited was a film titled “Who Shall Survive” made in 1971 for the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation for the study of ethical paradoxes in medicine.. Seminar leaders charged that. the movie provided explicit instructions for the performance of infanticide by showing a sign reading, “No feeding by mouth” on the crib of a Mongoloid infant at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Herbert J. Kramer, a spokesman for the Kennedy Foundation, interpreted the film's intent differently. “It was definitely not a primer for execution but was designed to reveal the ethical decisions that physicians make every day,” he said. “In fact, the film showed doctors fighting futilely to save the life of the child; but the parents refused to consent to surgery.” The seminar audience did not raise questions or ask for substantive evidence on these points. The five one‐hour segments of “Whatever Happened to the Human Race?” cost Franky Schaeffer V Productions, a company headed by Mr. Schaeffer's son, $1 million., The money was put together, Franky Schaeffer explained, through advances against rentals and sales, contributions tram the national television station of the Netherlands ana other donors. No money. was received from any organized faction of the right to life forces. The movies were. by far the most potent part of the program. Animation and dramatizations of real and imaginary events were used along with the comparison of aborted fetuses to black slaves in early America and the frail elderly with Nazi concentration camp victims. In the segment on abortion, Dr. Koop appears on what seems to be a desert of ice strewn with the naked bodies of black and white dolls. “I am standing on the site of Sodom, the place of evil and death,” the surgeon says, explaining that the dolls number only 1,000, a small proportion of the six million fetuses destroyed by abortion since the Supreme Court decision of 1973. In the segment on euthanasia, Dr. Koop speaks from Yad Vashem, the memorial in Jerusalem to victims of the Holocaust.. As the camera focuses on plaques baring the .names of concentration camps, Dr. Kopp explains that 275,000 human beings were exterminated in camps even before Hitler rose to power. “At first it was the frail, the.infirm and the retarded who were killed, not the healthy Jews, and that all started With the attitude that there is life not worthy to be lived,” he said, describing the premise. used to justify the termination of a life today. How Churches Can Help Seminar leaders offered a long list of ways in which the audience could influence their neighbors, institutions and legislative representatives. Mr. Schaeffer suggested that churches organize day care centers for the children of “women who must work,” and that individuals offer shelter in their own homes to pregnant women. “If we don't pay the price to provide alternatives, then we are as inhuman as the other side,” he said. What is the future of the Schaeffer team and its colleagues? As Mr. Schaeffer, who plans to return to his religious community in Switzerland sees. it, his occasional visits here and the films and book will continue to carry the message. “We have provided the right to life movement with its richest vehicle with the films and book. And we have also gone further than they have by showing from where this hor ror has come and where it can lead.” Until now, he conceded, the proabortion forces have won most of the battles, “but I think we are reaching enough people to turn this country around.” One person he reached was Ivelisse Roman, 28, of the Bronx, a member of the Love Gospel Assembly. Until now Mrs. Roman said she was ambivalent about abortion. “I would never have one, but I wondered if some situations didn't call for it, say the prostitute or the drug addict. Now I definitely beIieve in prohibition. Now I'm waiting to hear what I can do to help.”"
Abortion Fight Blocks Federal Spending Bill; 12.9% Raise Possible,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/29/archives/abortion-fight-blocks-federal-spending-bill-129-raise-possible.html,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 28 —Unable to break a deadlock over abortion, the Senate and House tonight abandoned efforts to head off an automatic 12.9 percent pay raise due to go into effect Monday for members of Congress and some 21,000 top‐level officials and judges. The impasse blocked passage of an important appropriations bill governing Federal spending for many Government agencies for the coming fiscal year, which begins on Monday, and the House left town for a 10‐day recess. It was not clear whether there would be any immediate effect on the Government payroll or other payments, or how long Congress could afford to wait before resolving the impasse. President's Right Cited In adjourning the Senate shortly before midnight, Majority Leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia said: “If the President wants to exercise his constitutional right to call Congress back in session, we'll be here.” The Senate is scheduled to meet tomorrow, and the House is scheduled for a pro forma session on Tuesday. A White House spokesman said late tonight, “We expect they will work something out next week before there is some serious detriment done to the Government.” The events leading to the impasse began when the House voted tonight to insist on restrictive abortion language in the bill, then adjourned for the recess. Angry senators, calling the House action irresponsible, promptly insisted on their own more liberal abortion provision by voting 55 to 9 to reject a conference agreement. Thus, Congress scuttled, at least until next Tuesday but more probably for 10 days, an appropriation bill that placed 5.5 percent limit on the raise. Seldom has there been such an angry confrontation between the House and Senate. Scenario Not as Planned It was not the scenario that backers of a Congressional pay raise had anticipated earlier. They had first sought a 7 percent raise, but the House rejected it. The House then agreed to a more modest 5.5 percent increase, which the Senate then rejected. But earlier today, Senate conferees gave in to intense House pressure and agreed to the 5.5 percent raise. Under a 1975 law, members of Congress and some 21,000 top‐level Federal officials and judges are entitled to an automatic cost‐of‐living pay increase in line with those given other Federal employees. Last year, with the elections approaching, Congress deferred for itself and those top officials and judges the 5.5 percent pay increase given that year to lesser Federal employees. The automatic increase this year for most Federal emolovees is oeaged at 7 percent. Adds Up to 12.9 Percent Thus, along with the interest accrued on last year's deferred raise, the sum now due members of Congress and top‐level officials and judges amounts to about 12.9 percent, barring Congressional action calling fora lesser amount. Members of Congress now make $57,500 a year. The automatic 12.9 percent increase would give them an additional $7,400, boosting their salaries to $64,900. The Senate and House could later rescind or lower the amount of the pay raise for themselves and for top‐level Federal officials. But the 12.9 percent increase that automatically goes into effect Monday for Federal judges cannot be altered. Accusing the House of total irresponsibility, Senator Edmund S. Muskie, Democrat of Maine, said tonight that he could not understand how the House had the nerve to “skip town” with such a crucial issue pending. Senator Muskie said that the “outrage of the country” will be so severe that House members will be forced to return to Washington and then “they'll really look like devious fools.” Senator Lowell P. Weicker, Republican of Connecticut, complained bitterly that “the House has stuck it to us.” Abortion Impasse Explained The abortion impasse revolved around differing Senate and House approaches to the difficult issue of Federal funds for abortions. The House version would forbid use of Federal funds for abortions unless the mother's life is endangered. The Senate version, in line with the present law, would continue to permit abortions when the mother's life is endangered, in cases of rape and incest, and in cases where “severe and long‐lasting physical health damage to the mother” was determined by two physicians. The conference agreement has now been rejected by the Senate, but several controversial issues had been ironed out earlier today by the Senate and House negotiators. After a brief flurry of debate, the Senate conferees agreed to accept a House provision that would prohibit the Federal Trade Commission from taking final action on trade regulation rules and from initiating new activities. The restriction, bitterly opposed by the commission, would remain in effect only for the life of the continuing appropriations resolution, until about Nov. 15. Conferees had also reached a compromise on trimming funds for Governmentfinanced travel for Federal employees. The Senate had sought to trim $750 million from the $8 billion budgeted in the coming fiscal year for Government travel. The conferees agreed on a $500 million reduction."

WASHINGTON,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/30/archives/washington-god-lives-in-boston.html,"BOSTON, Sept. 29 — If God is dead, it's news to Boston. This lovely old city is so excited over the arrival of the Pope that it has almost forgotten the death of the Red Sox. How are we to explain the enthusiasm that attends the visit of John Paul II to the United States? It is not because of a great revival of faith in the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church — his views on contraception and abortion, the priesthood and Christian religion within the family are rejected by many Roman Catholics. Nor is it simply because he is the spiritual leader of 700 million people in the world — Pope Paul VI never inspired such attention on his journeys from the Vatican, but was heard as a voice of futile good will. It is due, I believe, to the disenchantment of so many people with the secular world, and Pope John Paul's unique ability to touch their spiritual loneliness. Even many of those who have benefited most in the struggle for material well‐being soiiehow seem to feel amputated and separated from the religious heritage of their fathers. There are, of course, other factors that help explain the extraordinary appeal of this particular Pope. In an age that has somehow lost the gift of words, he speaks with simple eloquence in many languages. And he is a symbol of the heroic suffering and spiritual triumph of the Polish people. Paul Thibald, editor of the French journal Esprit, writing in Commonweal, makes this point: “The peoples of Eastern Europe have shown us what culture can be when it is conscious of its nobility, what the courage of a believer can be, and what the demand for human rights signifies. When repression receives its full recognition through a nonpolitical institution like the papacy, it makes one pause and think about the inadequacies of international structures, How to explain the enthusiastic response to the Pope's visit to our country? their inability to speak up for the most elementary moral needs, and their enslavement to the cynical game of national states.” No doubt there is a lot of hatred of the Soviet Union in all these demonstrations. There almost seems to be a longing among many people in this country now for a return to the bad old days of the Cold War, when we could hate one another without all this confusion over foreign words like “détente.” This of course is not the same as Pope John Paul's doctrine of love. It was a happy thought for the Pope to start his journey to the United States in Boston. Unlike most of our big cities, Boston does not destroy its memory. Like the human family, it is in a constant process of death and rebirth. Downtown today, it is pushing its new buildings into the sky, but retaining the comfortable huddle of family houses on Beacon Hill under the golden dome of the State Capitol. There may be a vague connection here between the spiritual and secular worlds. In both, there is conflict and corruption, but also an enduring struggle for something better. The Pope is not preaching to a new congregation of believers in America, but to a multitude of doubters who somehow believe in believing. This is not to suggest that we are on the verge of some religious revival or reformation in the world. Consider Iran, where a civil war in the name of religion is almost enough to make religion hateful. Consider Ireland, which is now carrying on an ancient religious war between people who have forgotten the religious principles they are supposed to be defending. Into this confusion of principles, nations, and principalities, Pope John Paul II has emerged, above all the contending races and nations, as a solitary figure — but with the ability to speak with great moral authority. Accordingly it's no wonder that he has emerged, not only as a spiritual but as a political force in the world. For all the other political and economic gods have failed, and he is speaking to the widespread sense of regret in the Western world about the spiritual heritage it has lost."
Children of Desire,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/30/archives/children-of-desire.html,"Just as everywhere else, there are loving hordes in the Fort Greene slum of Brooklyn who strike back at life with their own fecundity. Individuals fmd each other and reproduce and mark their existence with a new human. New to the hard life on Adelphi Street in Fort Greene is a baby named Chastity. She is a year old, born out of wedlock to Jeanette Alejandro and Victor Orellanes, two youngsters of sweet dark beauty. They became a couple after they first met three summers ago, when Jeanette was 13 and Victor was 12. They combined in a twist of innocence and passion that the young mother says she will always hold dear. The pregnancy began after a year of such cleaving on the far side of childhood, and never was Victor so tender again, Jeanette says, as when they awaited Chastity together. Now that the love is easing and Jeanette is 16, she has been forced to move with Chastity from Victor's parents’ home, where there was discord, and go back to her own mother five flights up from Adelphi Street. This girl does not talk in terms of being unmarried and does not regret how passing love can be, but Jeanette says it would have been good to finish the eighth grade and try high school. If only from her physical experience, Jeanette feels entitled to speak with wisdom. She tells her younger sister, Rosa, who is 15 and big‐bellied herself now with child, not to drink all that sugary Pepsi while she watches television. Rosa smiles somewhere between maternity and her own childhood, distracted by Lonnie, a tall, handsomely burnished young teen‐ager who impregnated Rosa and who nuzzles her tenderly as the soap opera drones on during his visit. The erotic sight of Lonnie and Rosa, touching and smiling, staring slowly at each other is remârkably similar to the tender weeks of a year or so ago when Jeanette and Victor lolled together, curled on the ripest edge of fruitfulness. “Oh, was I pregnant,” Jeanette says. “I was disgusting big. My stomach couldn't stretch no more.” All the children are by the television set — Chastity, Jeanette, Rosa, Lonnie and the unborn. The glass screen with the moving picture seems far away from them. The soapopera characters and their problems seem too imbued with causation to be plausible in the apartment on Adelphi Street. The girls’ mother, Ada, is down on the stoop, watching the street scene as if it were television. She has no complaints. She enjoys baby Chastity. She says Rosa's addition will be no burden, and hopes it will be a boy. “Baseball player,” says the smiling 36year‐old grandmother, who looks strong and slim and cynical as â jockey. These days both Jeanette and Rosa are telling their younger sister, Annette, who looks old for her 11 years, to beware of the fact that there is more to boys than their looks and the dreamy moments of meeting. “I tell her,” Jeanette says in the firm new voice she has developed for baby Chastity. “The other night I heard some guy on the phone with her. I warn her. I warn her good.” Whatever the missed advice about the blinding speed of reproduction, the three Alejandro sisters seem close. Jeanette's secret pregnancy was first spotted by her little sisters. Jeanette found a note on her dresser: “We know what's up with you. From Your Friendly Neighborhood Francis X. Clines writes the “About New York” column for this newspaper. Spies.” The note is sheer girlhood, a bit of tattle about a valentine, with no intimations about the raging biology of this life. Jeanette is beautiful. Her dark eyes are very honest in answering questions about what it's like to be an eighthgrader who misses three menstrual periods. “My friend explained how it goes and how I could go to the clinic at Cumberland Hospital. I wasn't scared,” she says. “I wasn't worried at all. I just thought: ‘I hope the baby will be O.K. and I won't be too fat.’ “ Chastity is O.K., she says, although slow in walking because of a turn in her foot. Jeanette exercises the foot the way the doctor at the clinic showed her. As complacent as Jeanette is with her situation, she agrees that something remarkable is happening in her social circle. All the girls she knows from J.H.S. 294 and the Fort Greene park on South Elliot Street have become pregnant lately, symptoms of what professionals are calling the No. 1 population‐control problem of the nation (see box on page 48). “All my friends,” she says, and slowly recalls each of those now with child. “There's Miriam, and Wanda, Rosa — this is another Rosa — and Elizabeth — she's only 13 — and Lori, the one on Clermont. I knew kids who were pregnant in the sixth and seventh grade, too. “I guess everybody wants a baby,” Jeanette says as Chastity whimpers for something in her mother's hand. “I don't know why.” Jeanette looks at Chastity, so freshly demanding. “Probably to fill in their life. They feel so bored. They got nothing to do with this life.” She instantly denies this was the case for her. “My life isn't empty,” Jeanette says. “This was an accident, that's all.” She stares at the curly‐haired accident, baby Chastity, who plucks endlessly at the mother. The baby is voracious in investigating the life of the apartment to fill in her own existence. For a strange moment in the apartment, as Jeanette smiles so satisfied and Chastity gurgles and reaches and Lonnie senses his satisfaction in Rosa's belly, reproduction seems spontaneous, as easily hatched in the romance of light rays from the television set as in fleshly intercourse. Soon, Jeanette says, Victor is moving away to another neighborhood, a better area, because of his father's job. “I don't mind. We had our love. There are others.” Her eyes are clear and steady. Childhood is ending. The merest mention of the notion of planning gets the first negative tone from Jeanette on her current life. “Victor and I planned — I moved in with his family and look what it got me,” she declares with a bitter nod. “Victor got out of hand, started acting tough and not respecting his father.” Jeanette does not talk of men in general terms, and she dismisses with a disbelieving smile the idea that in different ways there can be a male edge in life, and she has felt its sharpness. But each male she mentions — Victor, his father, her own absent father — sounds mercurial in her de scriptions, willful, unpredictable, unavoidable. She remembers very well how kind Victor's father could be, taking them all into Manhattan on the subway for a grand time at the Puerto Rican Day parade. That was last year when Victor's affection seemed to grow with the pregnancy, when he had a busboy job after school and put aside money for her, when his fa ther was high‐spirited. “His father hit the numbers five days in a row, won something like a thousand dollars,” she says. “It was good.” But then after she and the baby moved into the father's house, she saw the older man in his own self‐controlled world, “locked up in his own room, just like always, fair when he wanted to be.” She remembers how Victor began challenging the older man in little ways, finally pricking the father one day into stating his sovereignty in terms of Jeanette. “Victor's father shouted, ‘She is not my business. I want her out of my house!’” It can only be a suspicion, but that moment is recalled so crisply, with her dark eyes set afar, as if looking directly back to it, that the forced retreat from her new family to the old life of Adelphi Street may be for Jeanette a bigger event than any other, bigger than the yielding to Victor, bigger than the creation of Chastity. And she talks of it tightly, as the inevitable result of “planning.” “When you have all planned something,” she explains, “then it can blow up in your face and spoil the whole thing. I don't want to plan. If something good happens, it happens.” By Jeanette's account, the next great step toward independence in her life will come in two years when she is 18 and the welfare bureaucracy breaks her and Chastity out of her mother's welfare check and opens a new account, for a new generation. “I want to get out on my own,” she says. “I want to see what it's like to live alone. The separate check will help. They give you enough, and if I don't like it, I can move back in here.” Somewhere out beyond the apartment on Adelphi Street there undoubtedly is a disapproving, unimpoverished chorus waiting to condemn Jeanette for the implications of her comments on public treasury and private morality. But if you linger awhile, there is morality aplenty to be heard in the girl's observations about the present and the future. For one thing, she emphasizes that her mother takes her welfare “the right way,” with no man in the apartment unofficially, to siphon or fatten the welfare check. There is honor in this, the daughter says, and practical wisdom in going manless. “This way, she can't get into trouble.” And there is morality to be had from the church, according to the latest resolutions of this young mother. “I'm going to get Chastity to go to mass on Sundays and talk to the father for religious instruction,” Jeanette promises. “Soon as she is bigger. 1 only went on special occasions — Mother's Day, Easter. I want Chastity to do the communion. I never did.” Jeanette says she is religious enough to believe in the sanctity of life, to never have considered abortion when Victor impregnated her. She remembers a Father Murphy at Sacred Heart church down Adelphi Street where she used to go to fetch holy water for her mother. He always asked whether he would be seeing her at mass. That could be the difference for Chastity, Jeanette says now. Why do such matters always rest with a man? Jeanette doesn't seen. to understand the question. Again: Why is it you who yields to Victor, the boy‐become‐man? Why is it you who moves at the demand of Victor's father? “You do what you got to do for a man,” Jeanette says, echoing something — what? Fossilized intuition? A Rodgers and Hammerstein lyric? “You just do what you got to do. You got to please the man.” Across the way, Lonnie is well pleased as he nestles Jeanette's pregnant younger sister. The television soap opera involves a frowning woman's hope to attract a male doctor. Things are getting to seem too clear and simple in the apartment on Adelphi Street. Jeanette's best friend is a woman, not a man. She is Evelyn Charo, a young mother on welfare who lives over on Kent Avenue, near Myrtle Avenue. “Evelyn's great,” Jeanette says. “She's got five kids. She's 29, but she's like one of us teen‐agers, friendly and joking. I can tell her all my problems.” The girl met the young woman in her fateful summer, when Victor was playing handball in the park and first seemed attractive. As her friendship with Evelyn was growing over on Kent Avenue, her love for Victor was beginning over at the park. Evelyn has a boyfriend here and there and still seems in control, according to Jeanette's description. Evelyn gives her a sense of having a strong friend in life. “She's the one I trust, the one I go to.” Jeanette scoffs at the question of whether she is so influenced by her friend that she herself could wind up at 29 with five children on welfare. “You kidding?” she answers. “Five kids? No way. I don't want that to happen to me.” What guarantee does she have if she doesn't plan? “You take your protection and hope nothing happens,” the girlish mother replies. “I'll know what to do. I won't get involved seriously. I'll see a lot of guys. I'll decide when it's right to settle down.” For all of Jeanette's talk, the sense of childhood continues strong in the apartment. It seems stolen from Jeanette before her time and crushed to an essence that suffuses the rooms of her girlhood, the rooms where her own child reaches for her now. “I haven't missed anything,” Jeanette insists. “I can get a baby‐sitter and go to the movies or go roller skating or visit my friend Evelyn.” A big night out now for Jeanette is to take an F train to the Park Circle rollerdrome on Ocean Parkway and disco‐roller skate for hour after hour. “1 didn't even know how to roller skate when I was pregnant,” she says, as if explaining how the stages of life can only come one by one. “When Chastity gets bigger, I'm going to take her with me disco‐skating,” Jeanette says, her eyes so big and serious that they hint at how great the girl's devotion could have been for a boy. “Yeah,” she says to a sudden question, “I know it's past. Victor's hanging out with some bad guys now.” But she has memories that cannot be denied. “It was a good feeling,” she says. “Victor was there when I needed him. He worked and gave me what I wanted.” Before Victor there was another male who had moved on from Jeanette's life. “He is always such a serious man,” the girl says severely of her father. He moved out years ago, but before he left, Jeanette formed the image she has of a man sitting in a chair staring, “a serious man.” “He lives with his other wife now and his son, my stepbrother,” Jeanette says. A year and a half ago, on Father's Day, when Jeanette says she was stretched to bursting with the baby, she decided it was time to let her father know he was going to have a grandchild. This was the happy time when Victor paid such close attention and they were optimistic about establishing themselves with Victor's family. Her father lived over on Hoyt Street. She walked over in her maternity outfit and presented herself. “He didn't say nothing,” Jeanette says, frowning. “He's a serious man. He just stared at his TV.” That was it, she recalls quite exactly, nothing more from the man. “You ask him a question, he shakes his head. That's it. A serious man.” Chastity was born the following month, weighing in at 7 pounds 11 ounces. “Chastity only wants me — that makes me feel good,” Jeanette says. The girl talks of going back to school, of trying to get a job someday. She talks of trying to get her mother to put aside money from the welfare check to buy a stroller. Then she will take Chastity on the trips she has been imagining, to the Aquarium in Coney Island, to some museum in Manhattan, down • Adelphi Street to the church. Jeanette is so innocent that mother and daughter seem excellent company for those outings. She thinks there will be plenty of good life for her and for Chastity in the years to come. “I only knew Victor three years,” she says, as the baby tugs at her. “And look what happened in three years.” All the children — Chastity and Jeanette, Rosa, Lonnie and the unborn — stay by the television set. Downstairs, Chastity's grandmother stares out from the stoop, and over in the Fort Greene park a fresh crop of youngsters is staking out whatever fun is to be found, seeking out one another in the Fort Greene horde. ■"
Carter Declines To Recall House In Fund Impasse Major Appropriations Bill Is Stalled Over Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/30/archives/carter-declines-to-recall-house-in-fund-impasse-major.html,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 — The White House said today that President Carter would not summon the House of Representatives back from its 10‐day recess to break its impasse with the Senate on major appropriations bill. The deadlock has threatened to stall expenditures by at least 10 large Federal departments. Ditterences between the two houses came to a crisis late last night when Senators angrily voted down a House version of the appropriations bill. The House had included restrictions on Federal aid to abortions that were more severe than the Senate had approved, as well as a 5.5 percent limit on pay increases for Congress, Federal judges and 21,000 senior Federal officials that the Senate had reluctantly accepted. One result of the deadlock is that judges and Federal officials of higher ranks will get a 12.9 percent pay increase, effective Monday. The eventual compromise will probably reduce the increase for Senators, Representatives and Federal officials — but not, in all likelihood, for judges, because of a provision in Federal law preventing cuts in their pay. Measure to Extend Budgets The appropriations bill would have continued into the fiscal year 1980, which begins at 12:01 A.M. Monday, allotments for such major agencies as the Departments of Defense, Agriculture, Treasury, Transportation, Health, Education and Welfare, and the United States Postal Service. The bill, made necessary by the failure of the House and Senate to agree on an overall budget for the fiscal year, was sidetracked last night when the Senate rejected it on a vote of 55 to 9. Presidential advisers told reporters this afternoon that President Carter had decided, at a meeting this morning, not to exercise his Constitutional power to summon the House back from its break in order to iron out its differences with the Senate, which has remained in town. “The wheels of Government will not grind to a halt,” said Frank Moore, White House liaison with Congress. He and Stuart E. Eizenstat, the President's chief adviser on domestic matters, noted that in the past, Federal appropriations have been stalled almost two weeks into new year without major disruptions. Earlier in the day, when asked how long the nation could get along without passage of a continuing budget resolution, Robert C. Byrd, the Senate majority leader, said, “It's my understanding not very long. It may be for a few days.” Mr. Byrd called yesterday for quick action to avoid the sort of impasse that developed last night, and had scheduled Senate session for today in the event that President Carter ordered the House to meet. The House has planned a pro forma meeting for Tuesday, but such a session would not have a quorum and could not carry out important business. In debate over the last week, the two houses had disagreed over the politically sensitive issue of Congressional pay increases, with the House finally voting for the 5.5 percent Increase and the Senate giving its support to the same increase for judges and Federal officials but favoring a 7 percent increase for the legislators. The chambers had also disagreed over the wording of restrictions on Federal funds for abortions, with the House supporting aid only where the mother's life was endangered and the Senate favoring aid in additional circumstances, including cases of rape or incest. In a stormy conference committee meeting Friday, the Senate conferees gave in on the pay increase. But the House refused to give up the abortion language, known as the Hyde Amendment for its sponsor, Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois. After the House members went home yesterday, leaving the Senate with budget resolution including the stricter abortion language, the Senate voted down the entire measure in a stormy session, leaving pay increases of 12.9 percent to take effect Monday. Members of Congress now are paid $57,000 a year. A 12.9 percent increase would raise their salaries to $64,900. Despite the problems with the appropriations bill, Administration officials claimed the best legislative success ever this week, with several major bills enacted or moving toward enactment. Mr. Eizenstat, Mr. Moore and Anne Wexler, a Presidential assistant, in briefing for reporters, hailed the creation of a Cabinet‐level Department of Education, passage of legislation implementing the Panama Canal treaties, and progress in advancing legislation on energy and hospital cost containment."
News Summary,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/30/archives/news-summary-the-papal-trip.html,"Pope John Paul II began his Irish visit with an appeal to terrorists “to desist from hatred and violence and to repent.” The Pope addressed more than 200,000 people in Drogheda, near the Northern Ireland border, and attempted to allay suspicions among northern Protestants of his church and of himself. He appeared to have avoided the political thickets into which some had feared he would fall when he spoke of the sectarian conflict in the north.

The Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/30/archives/the-nation-in-summary.html,"Perseverance paid off for the Carter Administration last week when organized labor agreed to fill one‐third of the 15 seats on a new national Pay Advisory Committee, along with public and business members. The “national accord” to curb inflation was long in coming, and there were questions on all sides how long it could less. Despite doubts, the committee was nevertheless one of the few bright spots in the economic week, and one that gave the Administration a bonus as well. As for those numbers ... An Under Secretary of the Treasury, Anthony M. Solomon, told reporters that inflation would drop below 10 percent, the dollar would grow stronger, and the United States trade deficit would become a surplus. Within days of the briefing, Government reports for August showed consumer prices up 1.1 percent (an annual rate of more than 13 percent) and a trade deficit of $2.36 billion, up from $1.11 billion in July. The price of gold broke $400 an ounce. Most leading banks raised their prime interest rate to 13% percent. The Labor Department said that the real earnings of Americans dropped 0.8 percent in August, meaning a loss of spendable income of 4.2 percent over the last year. Mr. Solomon, of course, had been talking about the way things should turn out late this year and next year. But for the Administration, getting from here to there could become increasingly difficult in the face of continuing economic weakness. Congress Can't Get Its Houses in Order If it weren't for the 10‐day recess beginning this weekend, some members of the House might have had trouble figuring out whether they were coming or going last week. After vote reversals and other complications they went, leaving the Federal Government without a budget for the fiscal year that starts tomorrow and without appropriations to keep most departments running. The House did pass a $548 billion version of the budget, virtually unchanged from the one it rejected the week before, but there was no time to square it with the Senate version. In the meantime, the House and Senate see‐sawed over the appropriations measure until senators killed the bill in frustration over a conference committee's inability to compromise on two features. The Senate had agreed to one, a 5.5 percent increase in the $57,500 pay of members of Congress. But then the House side refused to delete a provision that has been anathema to senators, rigid controls on the use of Federal funds for abortions. The idea behind the salary proposal had been to exempt Congress from a poltically touchy pay raise of 12.9 percent that automatically goes into effect tomorrow for Federal employees and officials making more than $47,500. It presumably can be rescinded, but in the meantime, said Senator Edmund S. Muskie of Maine, House members will go home on vacation looking like “devious fools.” Ford Deals a Blow To SALT Approval Since Senate ratification of the strategic arms treaty is impossible without Republican votes, Gerald R. Ford's announced opposition to SALT last week carried a special sting. The former Republican President's position was not unexpected ‐ he told an interviewer earlier that the treaty, in his view, required amendments but his vehemence was. His views were even tougher than those of Henry A. Kissinger, his Secretary of State. Accusing the Carter Administration of allowing the country to sink into a position of present or imminent inferiority to the Soviet Union “at virtually every level of military competition,” Mr. Ford insisted in a speech before the Army War College in Carlisle, Pa., that the United States increase defense spending by 5 percent after inflation for at least the next five years. Mere pledges to that effect, he said, would not do: “My position is that I am against the treaty unless the necessary defense spending decisions have been made and written into law.” In rebuttal, Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Carter's national security adviser, said the SALT treaty before the Senate was better than the one Mr. Ford tried to negotiate. Whatever the treaty's merits, its chances of quick ratification look practically nil. Senate leaders last week again postponed the Foreign Relations Committee's wrapup hearings on SALT, to mid‐October. Judge Would Spoil The Spoils System Mayor Richard J. Daley's legacy became Mayor Jane M. Byrne's headache last week when a Federal judge ruled that patronage hiring, a venerable source of power for the Chicago Democratic and other big‐city machines, is unconstitutional. The decision by District Judge Nicholas J. Bua did nothing less revolutionary than challenge the “spoils” system that dates at least to the days of Andrew Jackson. But its potential effect on 20,000 Chicago and Cook County patronage appointees‐and on hundreds of thousands of non‐Civil Service employees elsewhere ‐ won't begin to be clarified until a court hearing Oct. 12 on proposed remedies. The case was brought a decade ago by an unsuccessful independent candidate for office, who contended that Democrats perpetuated their hold by using governmental power to hire politically loyal employees and control their votes. This resulted, Judge Bua agreed, in “deliberate discrimination” in the electoral process. Long Division In the Cabinet When a simple cell splits in two, that is called fission. When a Federal bureaucracy does so, that is called efficiency. When Congress last week approved splitting the biggest bureaucracy of all, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, it was something of a biopolitical miracle. The division gives President Carter perhaps his greatest domestic political victory so far this year - a separate Department of Education, which he has been advocating since 1976 to centralize Federal education programs and cut waste. What's left of the parent agency will become the Department of Health and Human Services. Mr. Carter's plan came close to dying in the House this year, especially after conservatives added amendments to permit voluntary prayer in schools and prohibit busing for school desegregation. Those changes were talked away in a HouseSenate conference, and the House approved the final compromise in a 215to‐201 vote. The new department, the 13th Cabinet‐level agency, will have an initial budget of ;14.1 billion and 17,400 employees. The Continuing Hell Of the Vietnam War Dark dreams, drug abuse and other afflictions of the heart and mind are indeed making it hard for many Vietnam veterans in civilian life, according to a study released last week. Veterans have been trying to draw attention to such readjustment difficulties for years. The new report may be especially significant because it was sponsored by the Federal Government, whose officials have generally maintained that Vietnam veterans were doing reasonably well. At that, the study was not disclosed by the Veterans Administration, which said these were the first, tentative conclusions of a larger analysis being conducted by the Center for Policy Research under a $1.2 million grant. Instead, it was issued by the newly formed Vietnam Veterans of America. Generally, the report said, veterans suffer because “nobody has applied the historic salve that could heal their wounded sense of collective pride.” Specifically, it noted: • More than 40 percent of those studied were involved in drug and alcohol abuse because of serious emotional difficulties. • More than 75 percent complained of marital trouble, job problems and symptoms such as “persistent nightmares, nervous reactions and troubling memories they wish to forget.” • Despite the availability of G.I. benefits, 53 percent of those who served in Vietnam failed to continue their education afterward, whereas the figure was only 31 percent for other veterans.

National Epidemic Of Pregnancies,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/30/archives/a-national-epidemic-of-pregnancies.html,"Every year, more than a million girls from 15 to 19 years of age — plus another 30,000 from 10 to 19‐become pregnant in this country and three‐fifths carry through to birth. The result is 600,000 new babies, about half of them ultimately born in wedlock, according to one recent study. One of every three of the pregnant teen‐agers has an abortion — a category of abortion that has been steadily rising — and the remaining pregnancies end in miscarriages. It is no longer valid to assume that the poor and members of minorities make up the bulk of these statistics; whites and the middle class generally are strongly represented. After years of studies and warnings, the Federal Government finally launched an Office of Adolescent Pregnancy Programs a year ago, starting it with a fund of $1 million in grants. Immediately, 9,000 community and government agencies across the country requested applications. “We were overwhelmed,” says a spokeswoman for the office, which requested a $60 million grant budget for the coming fiscal year, but will get $17.5 million, at best, under a pending Congressional compromise. The Planned Parenthood Federation of America describes teen‐age pregnancy as the nation's leading population‐control problem. Various studies have been focusing on the urgent need for educational remedies rooted in a simple distinction — teaching youngsters the difference between love and sexual appetite. But the distinction proves difficult for many communities to acknowledge in a formal, wellrun school curriculum and to present early enough to be effective. “If we are going to talk about preventive measures, then we have to talk about preadolescence,” says one leading professional, Dr. Mary S. Calderone, president of the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States. To attempt to reach the adolescent with information on sexuality and birth control, Dr. Calderone says, “is too little too late.”"
Trip Could Cast Pope as World Leader,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/01/archives/trip-could-cast-pope-as-world-leader-pontiff-seeks-moral.html,"DUBLIN, Sept. 30 — The coming seven days in October will establish whether Pope John Paul II has it within him to become a world leader, Vatican sources predict, or whether he will have to settle for being merely an effective and unusually attractive head of the Roman Catholic Church. News Analysis A promise of worldwide moral leadership was shown on the first two trips of his reign. they feel. but unlike the case of Mexico , and Poland, two Catholic countries, in the United States he will confront a society that is pluralistic, affluent and a world power. There is little doubt that the Pope wanted to visit the United Nations at the earliest possible time — that of the current General Assembly session. Indeed, it was as a result of the Vatican's dropping a few hints that Secretary General Kurt Waldheim consulted with the United States and other big powers on the Security Council and issued the invitation. But that invitation, along with the invitation to Ireland, was regarded as providing the ideal opportunity and timing for a journey through America. The message the Pontiff will carry to the United Nations Tuesday has not yet been made known. According to church officials in Rome and the United States who helped prepare the Pope's trip, he is eager to explore the following points: The affluent world's obligations to underdeveloped and poor nations. Human rights everywhere, including Communist countries. Strengthening the peace process in the Middle East. Assistance to the world's refugees, including the Vietnamese boat people, and international help for Cambodia. Talks With U.N. Delegates Those points could be discussed in his address or in talks with delegates. One high church official also raised the possibility of some gesture of contact, however small, between the Pope and the Chinese chief delegate and the Palestine Libera tion Organization's representative Co the United Nations. The United Nations visit, this official confirmed, was considered an early opportunity to initiate a series of visits to the United States, which the Pope knows fairly well from previous visits as the Archbishop of Cracow. The trip also repays a “debt” to John Cardinal Krol of Philadelphia, who was instrumental in getting him elected Pope. That the Pope aspires to worldwide moral leadership, and will use his American trip in pursuit of this goal, is beyond doubt. Nowhere, in fact, can this aim be better achieved than in the most powerful country in the western world. Further, he is still fresh from his triumphs in Mexico and Poland and is seen by his American audience as a new, dramatic figure in a world that lacks outstanding leaders. Consequently, the Pope could be expected to draw more interest now than in the later years of his reign. Election Delay Considered The Vatican, acutely aware of the Presidential election in 1980, realized that unless the Pope went to America this fall, before the contest had begun in earnest, the trip would have to be delayed until after the inauguration in 1981. The Pope did not want to wait that long. To Americans and their Government, the Pope is expected to address a plea to use their power wisely and generously around the world and to be wise also in the use of the material goods that the consumer society provides. Consumerism is a way of life that the Pope does not approve. He has often warned against the dangers of materialism and has pleaded for greater respect for spiritual values. It is a message he is expected to expand upon in America. The growing problem of world hunger and the moral obligation of the wealthy nations to stem it is certain to be another major theme of his message to Americans and to the United Nations. Justice, peace and human rights will be a theme, too, at the United Nations. Difficulties in Chicago In Chicago, the Pontiff will address the American Catholic hierarchy, and it is there that he faces perhaps the most difficult challenge of the trip. The American Catholic church is a far cry from the embattled Polish church that he knows so well and from the different, but equally embattled, Latin American church for which he had a deep instinctive understanding, Vatican experts say. Some are praying that he find the right tone; some are not at all certain he will. The new Pope has taken conservative positions on abortion, artificial birth control and divorce. For the clergy he has been insisting on greater discipline, on strict adherence to the vow of celibacy and on the wearing of clerical garb at all times. In the year since taking office he has not approved even one priest's request to leave the priesthood anywhere in the world. Pope Paul VI, by comparison, approved an average of 2,000 a year. The American Catholic church has been following moderate, or even “progressive,” policies on all those issues since the late 1960's. American Catholics have been told the church's official position on all those issues, but they have also been told to follow their own consciences. That is not to the liking of Pope John Paul II. Trip Called Unique Opportunity One of the unanswered questions is whether the Pope will try “to put the toothpaste back into the tube,” an American priest said recently in Rome. If the Pope did try to reverse the trend, the priest said, the effect on American Catholics and non‐Catholics could be disastrous. The priest added that he hoped the Pope would, instead, see his American trip as a unique opportunity to make himself the leader of the world ecumenical movement, bringing Catholicism and the other world churches closer rather than stressing their differences. The Pope's trip to Mexico early this year was considered a success because, in the words of one churchman, “the largest crowds ever assembled on earth” turned out for him and because he was able to cut through the thorny issue of “liberation theology.” He warned that the church should not be identified with any political group, but he also came out powerfully for Christian action against all political and economic oppression and, in the view of many, left “progressive” Latin American priests free to continue their fight with greater authority. The Elements of Success What will the Pope consider success in America? A priest in Rome who was asked that question said the Pope would call his trip a success if his message on world peace at the United Nations found a visible echo in the actions of governments, if his appearances with American crowds led to a deeper spiritual life in America and heightened religious interest among Catholics and non‐Catholics, and if he were able to sharpen a sense of social responsibility among the affluent nations."
High Court to Get Tests of U.S. Policies,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/01/archives/high-court-to-get-tests-of-us-policies-appeal-by-kissinger.html,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 30 — The Supreme Court term that begins tomorrow will, in several of its major cases, test the limits of Federal authority in areas in which activist Government policies have stirred political and economic controversy. In the area of race, the Justices will decide whether Congress can require that a fixed percentage of Federal public works money be earmarked for minority contractors, a question that necessarily puts all other versions of Government-mandated affirmative action on the line as well. In the area of Government regulatory authority, the Court will rule whether the regulators have to justify expensive new standards for exposure to toxic chemicals by showing that the expense bears a “reasonable relationship” to expected benefits in worker health and longevity. In labor relations, the Court will decide whether the faculty and professional staff of the nation's 1,500 private colleges and universities come under the protection of Federal labor laws, as the Government has asserted for the last decade. Among the individual petitioners is Henry A. Kissinger, the former Secretary of State, who is appealing a decision that notes of his office telephone conversations are subject to public disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. (Kissinger v. Reporters Committee, 781088). The Court has 77 cases set for argument, about half of what will eventually be the docket for the term. The Justices will select the other half from among roughly 2,000 petitions for review; they sifted through about 900 this week and tomorrow they are to announce the selections of perhaps 35 for full argument next spring. Many cases already selected cover familiar ground: school integration, search warrants, voting rights, coerced confessions, legislative immunity. But familiar issues do not make the term any more predictable. There were few predictions at this time last year that the Court would uphold both voluntary affirmative action and court‐ordered school busing in the North, as it did, or that the discord of the final case of its term would carry over into an unusual spate of public comments•by individual Justices in the summer recess. The Justices will have a chance to clarify that opinion, Gannett v. DePasquale, if they choose to grant review this term in a second case involving a closed courtroom. A Richmond newspaper publisher has filed an appeal challenging the constitutionality of a state law under which a judge barred the public and the press from a two‐day murder trial. The case, Richmond Newspapers v. Virginia (79a243), therefore presents the question of whether the majority in the GannettDePasquale case really intended that decision to authorize the closing of entire trials as well as pretrial hearings. Requests for review are also before the Justices in a case involving the constitutionality of the Hyde Amendment, which strictly limits the use of Federal Medicaid money for abortion. A Federal court in Illinois ruled that the amendment violates constitutional equal protection guarantees. The Federal Government, the state and some individuals have filed appeals. (U.S. v. Zbaras, 79‐491). Another petition for review challenges the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's policy of not considering the environmental consequences of a “class nine” accident, theoretically the worst type, when deciding whether to license a new reactor. The lower Federal courts upheld the policy. (Hodder v. N.R.C., 78‐1652). Following is a summary of some of the more important cases in which the Court has granted review and will hear arguments this fall. The minority contractors case, Fullilove v. Kreps (78‐1007), has broad implications for the Government's role in mandating special help for blacks — in this instance, a requirement that 10 percent of the $4 billion in construction grants awarded under the Public Works Employment Act of 1977 be set aside for minority contractors. Lower Federal courts split over the constitutionality of this program. The case poses questions that were not resolved by the Bakke or Weber cases of the last two terms, and it is potentially at least as important. The regulatory case, Industrial Union Dept. v. American Petroleum Institute (78‐911), also has implications beyond the specific controversy, which concerns Federal regulations setting maximum limits for on‐the‐job exposure to benzene, known to be a carcinogen. A Federal appeals court struck down the regulations, ruling that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration had failed to show that the half‐billion dollar cost to industry of compliance would result in any improvement to workers’ health. The agency argues that no such analysis is technologically possible, and that it is not obliged to perform one in any event. How — and whether — the regulators and the courts should balance unknown risks and benefits against known costs is the policy question that underlies a seemingly narrow issue of administrative law. The Government is also appealing a lower court decision holding that the National Labor Relations Board lacked the authority to order Yeshiva University to bargain with a faculty union. The court held that the faculty members, through their involvement with decisions on admissions, tenure, curriculum and the like, are not rank‐and‐file workers but managers, outside the scope of the National Labor Relations Act. Because Yeshiva's structure is typical of many private universities, the way the Supreme Court decides the case (N.L.R.B. v. Yeshiva, 78‐857) will probably determine the future for unionism at hundreds of institutions. Criminal law is always the biggest single category on the Court's docket, and this term there are two dozen criminal cases. Among the questions raised are the following: ¶Whether prisoners who escape from jail should be allowed to raise as a defense their desire to escape intolerable jail conditions. A Federal appeals court said they should, and the Government appealed. (U.S. v. Bailey, 78‐990). ¶Whether a state law that permits the police to enter a home without a warrrant in order to make an arrest is constitutional. The New York Court of Appeals said it was (Payton v. N.Y., 78‐5420). ¶Whether Federal courts, in criminal prosecutions of state legislators, are required to recognize a “legislative privilege” like the constitutional privilege enjoyed by members of Congress. A Federal appeals court said they were. (U.S. V. Gillock, 78‐1455). ¶At what point does contact between the police and a criminal suspect become “interrogation,” requiring that the suspect be advised of his constitutional rights. In this case (Rhode Island v. Innis, 78‐1076), a murder suspect being driven to the police station for questioning heard one officer tell the other that he hoped the students at a nearby school for handicapped children would not find the undiscovered murder weapon and hurt themselves. “Stop, turn around,” the suspect told the officers. “I'll show you where it is.” The Rhode Island Supreme Court held that the police comment was an improper interrogation and that the shotgun the police found could not be used as evidence against the suspect. The Court will also hear a challenge to a New York law under which the state reimburses parochial schools for the costs of complying with various state requirements. (Committee for Public Education v. Regan, 78‐1369). In another New York case, the Court will hear a political patronage dispute. Rocldand County's public defender is appealing a Federal court ruling that he was not free to dismiss two assistants, holdovers from the prior Republican administration, in order to replace them with Democrats. (Branti v. Finkel, 781654)."
Policies of Pope Protested,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/01/archives/policies-of-pope-protested.html,"About 50 homosexual men and women’ protested Pope John Paul II's policies on abortion and homosexual rights yesterday on me steps or St. Patrick's Cathedral. “The Pope claims to be for the human rights of all men and women,” said Andy Humm, a spokesman for the Coalition for Lesbian and Gay Rights. ‘ “But the Church has opposed the rights of lesbians and gay men at every turn.” Mr. Humm said the group planned a march on the United Nations tomorrow, when the Pope is scheduled to speak there."
Prayer Vigils Focus on Decision Not to Allow Women to Help Distribute Communion,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/01/archives/prayer-vigils-focus-on-decision-not-to-allow-women-to-help.html,"BOSTON, Sept. 30 — They wore yellow armbands and sang hymns of love, and one woman staged a Hindu sacred dance at the altar of the borrowed Protestant church. They called the service “A Celebration of Women,” and they wanted it known that it was not a “protest” the day before Pone John Paul II arrives here. But in Boston and most cities the Pope will visit, prayer vigils or services have been scheduled by Roman Catholic women and their supporters to underline their concern about the decision by the Pope's closest aides not to use lay persons in distributing communion in the Pope's masses. The women say this decision — made, according to church officials, because there will be no lack of priests to serve communion — is a direct slap at the recent participation of women as “eucharistic ministers,” who distribute communion at masses or to shut‐ins. “The exclusion of women eucharistic ministers from the papal mass is just another sign of the church's rejection of its women,” said Dody Stowe, of the Boston Women's Ordination Conference, before the service today. Church officials in Washington have noted that the position of unordained eucharistic minister was created only for times when no priest is available. But many women — who are supported by 2,000 members of Priests for Equality —say that the decision reflects the negative attitude of the church hierarchy toward women who have sought equal participation in church matters. “There will be a lot of security,” said Pat Skantze, another member of the planning group, “and also this is such a strong Catholic community that we don't want to alienate other Catholics by demonstrating. Also, a lot of us want to see the Pope, too. He's part of our heritage.” The heritage was represented this rainy afternoon by some 250 women and men at the Church of the Covenant, two blocks from the Common, where the mass will be held tomorrow. Many wore yellow armbands — the color was selected as a sign of oppression in Poland in World War II. However, yellow is also the Vatican color and the armbands are less likely to stand out in the sea of yellow. At the side of the altar was a banner that said: “If women can bake the bread, women can break the bread.” This theme is bound to be repeated this week as thousands of nuns and laywomen try to make their point to church officials. Hope has been expressed that their concerns will somehow reach the Pope, who has often spoken of the need to listen as well as preach. “He did it in Puebla,” said Sister Donna Quinn, the leader of 450‐member Chicago Catholic Women, in a reference to the Pope's visit to Mexico in January. The Pope had warned members of the clergy to stay out of secular affairs, but after several days of contact with activist Brazilian bishops and of observing the mood of Mexico, he rewrote speeches and spoke more clearly of the church's support for social justice, even suggesting “expropriation” of unused farm land. In New York, there will be an overnight prayer vigil at Dag Hammarskjold Plaza, 47th Street and First Avenue, from 8 P.M. Tuesday to 6 A.M. Wednesday. In Des Moines, there will be a two-andhalf hour march tomorrow from the Civic Center to the cathedral, beginning at 5:30 P.M. A women's group also plans to hold a banner expressing their concerns at the papal mass at the Living History Farms on Thursday. In Chicago, which has been a major center of Catholic women's groups, no demonstration is planned this week, to avoid any identification with a march apparently being planned by atheists. Many of the Catholic activists will converge on Washington on Friday, when a demonstration of some sort will be staged outside the Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, near Catholic University, at noon. More protesters in Washington are expected to meet at 11:30 A.M. Saturday at St. Matthew's Cathedral for a march to the Executive Office Building, where a “morality play” is to be staged outdoors while the Pope is meeting with President Carter. An all‐night prayer vigil is planned outside the home of the Apostolic Delegate to the United States at 3339 Massachusetts Ave. N.W., where the Pope is to stay overnight Saturday. Thousands of posters have been put up around New York City saluting Pope John Paul II for “upholding the rights and dignity of men and women everywhere,” but the New York chapter of the National Organization for Women has taken mild exception to that praise. The feminist group favors liberal abortion laws, which the Roman Catholic Church emphaticcily does not. Without criticizing the Pope directly, the group issued a statement asserting that “women will never have rights, or dignity, unless they can control their own bodies.”"
"Senate Votes, 77 to 9, to Deny Automatic Raises to Members of Congress",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/02/archives/senate-votes-77-to-9-to-deny-automatic-raises-to-members-of.html,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 1 — In the latest round in the fight over Congressional salaries, the Senate voted tonight to deny members of Congress the annual $7,400 pay increase that automatically went into effect at midnight last night. The vote, taken on an appropriations bill that has been the subject of a long House‐Senate dispute, was 77 to 9. But with the House now in recess until early next week, the Senate action represents little more than an effort to assure dubious public that Congress — or at least the Senate — has no intention of taking any pay increase. Accusing the House of leaving the Senate “holding the bag,” Senator Reobert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the majority leader, said it was essential for the Senate to act, even though the House was not in Washington to follow through. Meanwhile, Senate and House Democratic leaders met with President Carter and his budget advisers tonight at the White House to discuss what impact, any, the Senate‐House impasse over the crucial continuing appropriations bill would have on the ability of Government departments and agencies to operate in the fiscal year that began today. The seemingly unrelated issues of money to operate the Government, pay raises for members of Congress and other top officials, and restrictions on Federal funds for abortions are all intertwined in one of the angriest Senate‐House confrontations in years. Since money bills for most departments and agencies have not yet cleared Congress, the continuing appropriations measure was designed to allow them to continue spending funds at the same level as during the expiring fiscal year. However, Senate and House conferees deadlocked over the abortion provisions attached to the bill. As a result the Senate scuttled the bill shortly before midnight Friday, not long after the House officially began a 10‐day recess. The death of the appropriations bill in turn cleared the way for an automatic cost‐of‐living pay increase of 12.9 percent for members of Congress, top‐level Federal employees and judges, effective today. Cap on Pay Increases As approved by the House, the money bill placed a 5.5 percent cap on the automatic raises. The Senate subsequently voted to exclude members of Congress from any pay increase, but Senate conferees finally agreed Friday to the 5.5 percent pay increase. With the death of the appropriations bill, there was no way to forestall the 12.9 percent increase. This sum represents the 5.5 percent given last year to most Federal employees but deferred by Congress for itself and top Federal officials and judges; the 7 percent increase to which they and all other Federal employees are supposed to receive this fiscal year, and interest accrued on last year's deferred raise. Congress can now refuse a raise for its members, who are paid $57,000 a year, or might settle for a smaller increase. It could also set a smaller increase for toplevel Federal employees, including Cabinet members. Federal judges are locked into the 12.9 percent pay increase, however, since by law their salaries cannot be reduced during their terms of office. Salaries for Judges As a result, starting today, the salary of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court rose from $75,000 to $84,700; salaries of associate justices from $72,000 to $81,300; those of Federal appeals judges from $57,500 to $65,000; and those of Federal district judges from $54,500 to $61,500. Seeking today to continue funds for Federal agencies while denying the Congressional raise, the Senate Appropriations Committee attached these provisions to a previously approved House resolution dealing with the Federal Trade Commission. The Senate committee proposal, passed by the Senate tonight, also included a more liberal abortion formula than the House had wanted. The House had insisted on denying Federal funds for abortions except when the woman's life is endangered. The Senate, equally adamant, would permit funds in cases of rape and incest and when permanent physical damage might result to the woman, as determined by two physicians. The Senate‐House impasse was described today by the House majority leader, Jim Wright of Texas, as a “game of brinksmanship” reflecting no glory on either side. “It's a mutual case of stubbornness,” he said. He said that he and House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. did not feel the need to ask House members to cut short their recess. “We've been through this kind of thing before,” he said, “and there was no panic.”"
Irish President Calls Visit Inspiration,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/02/archives/irish-president-calls-visit-inspiration-serenaded-by-seminary.html,"LIMERICK, Ireland, Oct. 1— Pope John Paul II ended his joyous three‐day pilgrimage to Ireland today with conservative reaffirmations of the Roman Catholic Church's opposition to abortion, contraception and divorce, then flew off to the United States for a sevenday visit. For the people of this island republic, conscious of the price their forebears paid for their faith, the Pope's visit was “a most moving and inspiring experience,” the memory of which “will remain forever bright,” as their President, Patrick J. Hillery, said in a farewell speech at Shannon Airport. Everywhere that John Paul went, he saw crowds stretching to the horizon: 1.3 million at Dublin's Phoenix Park for his first mass on Saturday, 400,000 at Limerick's racecourse for his last this morning. In all, almost three million people saw him. Many came from abroad, and some caught sight of him twice or more, but the sum of the multitudes that turned out for the first papal trip here nearly equaled the nation's population. The Pope left with thanks for the “warm and loving” reception he had received, with praise for “Ireland, semper fideils — always faithful,” with hugs for the Irish bishops, with a few jesting words about the Irish weather, which turned genuinely foul as he departed, and with a final apostolic blessing from the stairway leading to his Aer Lingus jetliner. Choirs sal “Danny Boy” as he climbed aboard. This morning, at Maynooth Seminary just west of Dublin, the Pope was serenaded by 1,000 boisterous students for the priesthood in the colorful Gothic chapel. They clapped and swayed as they sang the spiritual that became a kind of anthem of praise to the Pope over the weekend: “He's Got the Whole World in His Hands.” The Pope's message was somber and challenging. He quoted St. Paul to support the view that this was a wonderful time to be a priest, and he admonished the seminarians not to “help the trend toward ‘taking God off the streets’ by adopting secular modes of dress and behavior yourselves.” Next the Pope flew southwest to Limerick, where he asserted that the very possibility of divorce “makes stable and permanent marriages more difficult,” because separation “gradually comes to be accepted as a normal part of life.” He arrived so late that the mass had to begin in his absence. Quoting the Second Vatican Council, he called abortion “one of the abominable crimes,” and said: “The defense of the absolute inviolability of unborn life is part of the defense of human rights and human dignity.” He urged Irish Catholics to remember that “generous openness to accept children from God is the mark of the Christian couple.” The Irish seemed to have been most impressed by the warmth and informality of the Pope, who .referred to himself during the visit with the everyday “I” rather than the majesterial “we” of his predecessors. A charwoman in Limerick, leaning against her vacuum cleaner this afternoon, said to a friend, “Such a lovely man, oh, such a lovely, fatherly smile.” A Dublin banker spoke of his astonishment that “a whole country came to love someone so much in so short a time.” But the theme of the Pope's theological message, not only on social issues but on the role of Mary, was less universally popular. The Irish hierarchy welcomed it as an antidote to the recently drooping morale of the church, particularly among the young. Those who seek doctrinal change, Protestants and many people working for reconciliation between Ireland and Northern Ireland were concerned. “The Limerick speech sounded like every 19th‐century monsignor you ever heard,” said a young liberal priest who heard it. “Those in the north who saw those massed ranks of Catholics on television,” said a Dublin politician with Protestant connections, “inevitably worry even more about being swallowed up in unification. To that political fear, you can add the fear excited by his opposition to abortion and divorce and his idolization of the Virgin.” The tensions the Pope left behind were dramatized tonight in a political and theological wrangle on Ulster television between the Rev. Ian Paisley, the Protestant extremist, and Gerry Fitt, a Catholic member of the British Parliament. Dublin politicans expressed hope that the Pope's appeal “on my knees” — at Drogheda on Saturday — for an end to violence would fall on fertile ground. And Margaret Thatcher, the British Prime Minister, said it was “earnestly welcomed by everyone concerned” with Northern Ireland and might well engender a new spirit of peace. The efforts of the Minister for Northern Ireland, Humphrey Atkins, to find an opening for a new political initiative, perhaps a measure of local selfgovernment, appear likely to be accelerated. He had planned to begin intensive consultations within a month; now they will begin immediately. This morning, however, members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army, holding a family hostage in their house overlooking the main express way into Belfast, opened fire on a British Army Land‐Rover even before the Pope had left Ireland. The two soldiers in the vehicle escaped serious injury. The Ulster Volunteer Force, one of the main Protestant paramilitary groups in the north, said today that it would lay down its arms if the I.R.A. did so."
Pope's Moral Challenge to West,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/02/archives/popes-moral-challenge-to-west-papal-journey-an-analysis-papal-theme.html,"BOSTON, Oct. 1 — Pope John Paul II continued today to sound a spiritual and moral challenge to the values of Western society that he began over the weekend in Ireland. In so doing, he paved the way for an unapologetic and aggressive campaign in behalf of moral teachings that have been rejected by growing numbers of American Catholics. On Boston Common, the Pontiff repeated his plea to young people to shun the lures that could draw them away from devotion to Jesus. He especially warned them against giving in to easy living when they encountered failures. To make his point, the Pope used an illustration of the biblical account of Jesus's challenge to the rich young ruler who, by implication, possessed great riches in a sense analogous to the situation of well‐to‐do cultures. “Faced with problems and disappointments, many people will try to escape from their responsibility: escape in selfishness, escape in sexual pleasure, escape in drugs, escape in violence, escape in indifference and cynical attitudes,” the Pope said. “I propose to you the op Lion of love, which is the opposite of escape.” Further in his homily, he said: “With Christ's help, and through prayer, you can answer His call, resisting temptations and fads and every form of mass manipulation. Open your hearts to the Christ of the Gospels — to His love and His truth and His Joy. Do not go away sad!” In the stay in Ireland, the Pope amplifled other aspects of his attack on Western morality. Yesterday in Dublin and Galway, the Pope attacked materialism, atfuence and sexual freedom, referring in an address to throngs of young people to the “moral sickness that stalks your society.” While Ireland was the platform for the criticism, the Pope clearly implied that the Irish were only being influenced by a pervasive change in values in the modern world. Noting Ireland's situation, he said: “She is not immune from the instruments of ideologies and trends which present‐day civilization and progress carry with them.” More than at any time in his travels as Pope, the former professor of moral theology in Poland is taking the initiative as chief spokesman for traditional Catholic values against what he appears to view as a wave of decadence brought about by riches and greater freedom of choice. In addition to exhorting young people in Dublin to uphold church teaching against abortion and divorce and warning them to resist “self‐indulgence and consumerism,” the Pope expanded his theme of how moral collapse takes place. “Everybody wants the full freedom in all areas of human behavior and new models of morality are being proposed in the name of would‐be freedom,” he said. “When the moral fiber of a nation is weakened, when the sense of personal responsibility is diminished, then the door is open for the justification of injustices, for violence in all its forms and for the manipulation of the many by the few. The challenge that is already with us is the temptation to accept as true freedom what in reality is only a new form of slavery.” At Galway, at a mass for young people, the Pope engaged in a shadow debate against people who suggest that the church's morality is outmoded. Serving notice that he would not back away from such opponents, he depicted to the young people a nation that had lost much of its allegiance to Catholic teaching as it became more modernized. “Like so many other young people in various parts of the world,” he said, “you will be taught that changes must be made, that you must have more freedom, that you should be different from your parents and that the decisions about your lives depend on you and you alone. “You will hear people tell you that your religious practices are hopelessly out of date, that they hamper your style or your future, that with everything that social and scientific progress has to offer, you will be able to organize your own lives and that God has played out His role.” The Pope warned that a nation that “lost its higher religious and moraL principles” was subject to tyrannical forces. The Pope's determination to wage counteroffensive against many Western values is seen by some American Catholics as badly needed and by others as premature. Those who support the effort believe the Pope's personal credibility and popularity enormously strengthen a crucial reassertion of Catholic standards of sexuality and economics. Also, they believe that much of the West is disillusioned with materialistic values and open to such a campaign. The doubters, on the other hand, wonder whether the Pope appropriately appreciates the values of choice in an open society, which contrasts so sharply from his experience under Polish Communist rule. They ask whether modern and economically advanced democracy must automatically be equated with decadence. On the issue of sexuality, the Pope clearly thinks that many in the West have gone too far. In the summer, for example, the Vatican, reportedly with the Pope's approval, harshly criticized a book, “On Human Sexuality,” that had been commissioned by the Catholic Theological Society of America. The book reflected a favorable view of selffulfillment as a goal of sexual behavior and did not recommend strict obedience to church teaching. Polls show a widening gap between official church teaching and the attitudes of American Catholics. According to the 1978‐79 Gallup survey, “Religion in America,” 69 percent now believe that divorced Catholics ought to be able to remarry in the church; 73 percent disagree with the church's ban on artificial birth control, and 44 percent say the church should relax its standards forbidding abortions under any circumstances. A special Associated Press/NBC poll found that an overwhelming majority of American Catholics approved of Pope John Paul's leadership of the church even if they disagreed with some of his stands on social and moral issues, The Associated Press reported today. On one issue, the poll showed that 66 percent of Catholics thought the church should approve some artifical method of birth control. But 79 percent of those questioned said they approved the way Pope John Paul was leading the church. The National Opinion Research Center has shown that the major cause of the sharp drop in church practice in recent years has been a conflict between Catholics and the church over sexual morality. Any successful campaign to win back those disaffected Catholics, analysts say, must be founded on a revised set of sexual ethics. From the Pope's latest statements, such a reformulation would apparently be unnecessary. He has decided the rules should not change but that they need a more vigorous and persuasive presentation."
News Summary,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/02/archives/news-summary.html,"TUESDAY, OCTOBER 2, 1979 The Papal Trip Pope John Paul II arrived in Boston to begin a seven‐day national tour. He was greeted by Rosalynn Carter, who led a contingent of officials. Mrs. Carter hailed John Paul II as a “champion of the vision that unites mankind — our Creator's vision of a world of justice and a world of peace.” The Pope celebrated a mass on Boston Common, attended by 100,000 people despite a steady rain. [Page A1, Columns 1‐3.] American Catholics look to the Papacy for many, often contrasting, forms of leadership. As a symbol of unity among 49 million people sharply divided over many religious issues, the Pope faces difficult challenge. His success will be measured largely by his ability to address an increasingly complex number of Catholic groups depending on him to advance their interests. [A9:1‐2.] The Pope was Inflexible in reaffirming the Roman Catholic Church's opposition to abortion, contraception and divorce as he ended his three‐day visit to Ireland. As he departed for the United States, he expressed thanks for the “warm and loving” reception he had received. It was estimated that the total number of people who had turned out to see John Paul on the first papal trip to Ireland equaled the country's population of 3 million. [A14:5‐6.] International Measures to offset Soviet troops in Cuba were announced by President Carter in a national television address. They will include increased surveillance of Cuba and a new Caribbean task force based in Key West. Mr. Carter urged that the troops issue should not block approval of the arms limitation treaty, which, he said, would be a a greater danger to peace than the Soviet troops in Cuba. He said that Moscow had refused to withdraw the 2,000 to 3,000 troops, but had given “significant” assurances that the unit would not be increased or augmented. [A1 :6.]  Key Democrats were mildly critical of Mr. Carter's address on the Soviet troops issue. A strong move appears likely in the Senate to adopt a reservation stating that the strategic‐arms treaty cannot be given legal force until the President has certified that Soviet troops in Cuba have no combat function or are no threat to the United States. [A1:5] The dollar fell against key currencies in extremely heavy trading despite strong support purchases by central banks. Gold prices rose to new records as turbulence erupted in world financial markets, and for the first time gold closed above $400 in Europe. [A1 :4.] Panama celebrated the Canal Zones's passing to its jurisdiction, which became effective at midnight Sunday. “Panamanians will no longer be judged by foreign laws in their own country,” President Aristides Royo told a crowd of 50,000 who marched into the area. [A3:4‐6.] Chile's Supreme Court turned down an appeal from the United States for the extradition of three army officers who were indicted for the murder in Washington, in September 1976 of Orlando Ortelier , a Chilean exile leader.

Pontiff Brings U.S. a Plea for Rededication,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/02/archives/pontiff-brings-us-a-plea-for-rededication-pontiff-brings-us-appeal.html,"BOSTON, Oct. 1 — Pope John Paul II, exhorting Americans to “fulfill completely your noble destiny of service to the world,” came to the United States today, beaming at large and affectionate crowds in the streets and urging the nation's youth to accept discipline in place of materialism. His voice ringing deep and rich, the Pope began his seven‐day national tour with a simple expression of love for Mrs. Carter's greeting, the Pope's response and homily, page A10. America and a call for rededication to spiritual values. “Dear young people,” he declared from a high pontifical altar erected in Boston Common, “do not be afraid of honest effort and honest work; do not be afraid of the truth.” American youth, he said, should be “resisting temptations, fads and every form of mass manipulation.” Enrlier today the Pope ended his visit to Ireland with conservative reaffirmations of the Roman Catholic Church's opposition to abortion, contraception and divorce. Tomorrow, he will come to New York to address the United Nations and say mass at Yankee Stadium, where preparations were under way yesterday. [Page A14.] As he arrived in this keystone city of American Roman Catholicism, the Pope was greeted by President Carter's wife, Rosalyn, who hailed him as a “champion of the vision that unites mankind —our Creator's vision of a world of justice and a world of peace.” Responding to the enthusiasm that engulfed his motorcade through the city, Pope John Paul looked out on a drizzlesoaked crowd of 100,000 gathered for the mass on the Boston Common and declared: “I greet you, America the beautiful!” The crowd responded with cries of “Viva Papa!” And the Pontiff paused and carefully ad‐libbed: “Beautiful! Even if it rains!” Minutes after walking down from the jet that brought him here from Ireland, Pope John Paul was in the midst of a hearty American welcoming committee of politicians and prelates, a group that included Speaker of the House Thomas P. O'Neill, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, and Gov. Edward J. King of Massachusetts. The Pope's trip will take in six points of the nation, sweeping him through cities that stocked the nation with immigrants, a simple rural church in the Iowa Farm Belt, and the seats of world power at the United Nations and the White House. “I come as one who already knows you and loves you,” the Pope declared at the beginning of a day of nationally televised appearances, “as one who wishes you to fulfill completely your noble destiny of service to the world.” Believers and Nonbelievers Leading the colorfully robed ranks of the nation's Catholic hierarchy was Humberto Cardinal Medeiros, the host prelate as Archbishop of Boston. Soon after the airport greeting, the Pope had the archdiocese's 2,000 priests cheering emotionally at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross as he blessed and praised them in their dedication. His greeting to “Dear brothers and several sisters in Christ” stirred an extra peal of applause and delight. The crowd gathered for mass and his message at the Common included Catholics and non‐Catholics, believers and nonbelievers. They stood fascinated by the white‐garbed leader of world Catholics. “This is an event,” said Peter Simon, holding his 4‐week‐old son, Todd. “He is one of the few genuine world leaders, whose influence crosses national borders.” The crowd cheered the Pope's message at the mass. “I was touched by what he said,” said 22‐year‐old Daniel Thomas, of Hamilton, Mass., as he stood back from the large gold‐and‐white altar. “He understands young people without question. But his main message to me was, while you question, you still believe.” The motorcade route into town was altered without explanation at one point. The change skirted a small group of black demonstrators protesting “racism” in white Catholic neighborhoods. In particular they protested the shooting last weekend of a black youth that paralyzed him. Three white teen‐agers have been arrested in the shooting. Papal Praise for Boston The Pope hailed Boston as a city that, “through the many upheavals of history,” has always been able to find “workable solutions” and provide a home “where all people can be respected in their human dignity.” The other note of protest in this city came from church members who were offended by the failure to provide women to distribute communion at the mass. Veteran Vatican correspondents said that Pope John Paul seemed noticeably older, as he arrived here, than he did in his first two foreign trips to Poland and Mexico over the last year. On this wet day, the crowds were noticeably smaller than some predictions of more than a million people. Nevertheless, Pope John Paul's special way with crowds could be seen taking hold at different points as he lin gered to touch the people and pause, beaming at their cheers. The Pope's weeklong visit began almost 14 years to the day since Pope Paul VI paid the first papal visit to the United States, a 14‐hour visit to New York in which he celebrated mass and spoke at the United Nations. After Pope John Paul II visits New York City, he will move on to Philadelphia, Des Moines, Chicago, and Washington, where he is to meet with President Carter. On the plane bringing him here, the Pope sent a message to President Carter that read: “On entering the United States’ airspace, I am happy to send you my greetings and to assure you of the pleasure with which I look forward to my visit to your beloved country. God bless America.” Boston gave itself over to the Pope in ways grand and small. John Paul II T‐shirts were on sale at the airport side by side with T‐shirts of the beloved Red Sox, and Protestant leaders joined in the plan to salute him through the city's more than thousand church bells. The throng on the Common waited for the Pontiff in a gentle, summerfest mood. Youngsters were perched on the laps and shoulders of the statues of the World War I monument overlooking the altar. There seemed to be dual roots for the spirit of the crowd: deep and simple faith rooted in the here‐. after; a great curiosity rooted in the instant's chance for a glimpse of a unique celebrity, a “superstar,” as one newspaper described the Pope. ‘He Seems Like a Nice Guy’ “I haven't been to mass since the last funeral in my family,” Joanna Forgione, an 18‐year‐old saleswoman from Somerville admitted beneath the damp bough of an elm tree. “But this Pope is special. He doesn't stay in his little house like the others. He seems like a nice guy.” As the Pope arrived, he found a metropolitan archdiocese that still marks Boston as a powerhouse city for the church in the New World. There are more than two million Roman Catholics in the city and suburbs. Even with dwindling church attendance and a more questioning attitude among parishioners, Boston's Catholics have been active enough so that in the last decade the archdiocesan building debt has shrunk from $42 million to $9 million. With bedrock local elections coming next month in this predominantly Catholic place, politicians vied to be seen bowing to the Pope. One legislator demanded mandatory jail terms for enterprising thieves who had been scalping counterfeit tickets to the papal mass. Automobile traffic was banned from downtown Boston, and the crowds came early, many people on foot, with 250 parishoners setting a course by boat from Hull. The city was sparkling on a gray day and the entire police force seemed to be on duty, intent on guaranteeing a safe and joyous welcome. Seeing America Summarized Cheering celebration was the simple point of the motorcade. But the Pope's route presented a stirring, bittersweet summary of America, from the North End where Paul Revere rode out in the Revolution two centuries ago to the ghetto crossroads at Roxbury where racial tensions reveal the modern failure to integrate the nation fully. And back from the ghettos, white and black, rose the city's affluence — luxurious old houses, stout banks, regentrified slum markets — laced into the skyline by the curl of the Charles River. The city presented a pallette of clerical colors to blend with the day's autumnal spirit. There were the monsignori in crimson cassocks, the Bishops in purple and the princes of the church in cardinal red, all of them outranked by the immaculate white cassock of the Pope."
U.S. Catholics Find Prejudices Waning,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/02/archives/us-catholics-find-prejudices-waning-change-your-name-or-be-best.html,"Christopher Columbus was a Roman Catholic. Another Catholic explorer, Amerigo Vespucci, gave America its name. Catholics of Irish, German, Polish and a variety of other ethnic backgrounds furnished the muscle and sweat and brains to help build an industrial superpower and provided men to fight its wars. But over much of United States history, anti‐Catholicism was an everyday part of the American scene. Nine of the original 13 states established Protestantism as the state religion. As recently as 1960, Americans were debating whether a member of the Roman church should be President. And yet, for some 49 million Catholics today, few vestiges of prejudice remain. Indeed, in a cultural, educational and social explosion, Catholics have brushed aside the old barriers and made striking gains to reach the top in government, business and industry, occupying the board rooms and other positions of power once denied to their forebears. “It was our grandfathers who had the bitter anti‐Catholic experience,” said Robert Wussler, 43 years old, who was president of the CBS television network before starting his own production company. For Rocco Sicilian, 57, board chairman of TICOR, a multimillion‐dollar conglomerate specializing in title insurance, “it was a case of either changing your name or trying to be the very best” in the fight for success in America. On balance, that success has been considerable. Surveys outside the South show that Catholics now have higher income and educational levels than Baptists, Methodists, Episcopalians and members of other Protestant sects. They are second only to Jews in those areas. (Social scientists avoid the South in surveys of this sort, because the disproportionately black and rural composition of the Protestant population in the South skews the national sample.) The Rev. Andrew Greeley, a priestsociologist working at the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center, has contended that many of the changes have gone unnoticed and that many Americans, including the members of the news media, cling to old stereotypes about Catholic ethnics. Untrue ‘Truths’ About Catholics “Everyone imows” that this is “true about Catholicism,” Father Greeley wrote with some sarcasm in 1977, adding: “Catholics tend to be blue‐collar workers and belong to the lower‐middle class. Educationally and financially they do not compare with their Protestant counterparts. A Catholic background makes it less likely that a young person will choose an academic career or, should he choose one, do well in it. Those Catholics who do become successful academics will leave the church. Irish Catholics, who have been in the United States longer than other ethnic groups, have achieved a certain amount of modest respectability, but they have not made the most of their opportunities in the new world.” Then Father Greeley said, “Every single one of the above propositions is demonstrably false.” Citing data from his surveys for the research center, he showed that Catholics, led by Irish Catholics, were making more money than any other Christian denomination and were only slightly behind the income level of American Jews. Educationally, he demonstrated, Catholics were right at the national average and moving up fast; they were the second most mobile group in American society, again right behind American Jews. Father Greeley said that, while his study showed too few Catholics were rising to the top in American corporate life, “a younger generation of Catholics have found no real obstacle between their religion and successful pursuit of academic careers,” adding: “They have gone to graduate school, obtained their doctorates, have appointments in the elite colleges and universities, are publishing articles, displaying the values and attitudes appropriate to intellectuals, and are not substantially less likely to go to church than any other Catholic of their generation.” The Rev. William Van Etten Casey, a Jesuit from Boston , points out that the Catholics of the late 1960's and the 1970's were secure enough to drop an earlier “Catholic superpatriotism” and take a prominent position in the antiwar movement. “And in 1971,” said Father Casey, “they forced the American bishops to come out against the Vietnam War. That was the first time the bishops ever came out against any war.” A study entitled “Catholics and American Politics,” by Mary T. Hanna, soon to be published by Harvard University Press, confirms the statements of Fathers Greeley and Casey. Catholics of the 1970's were not only right in the middle of American society, she says, but challenging the values of that society as well. Despite the stereotypical image of Catholics as “conservative and antiprogressive,” Dr. Hanna, political science professor at the State University of New York at Binghamton, asserts that the American Catholics are “very liberal” on matters dealing with problems related to the general welfare: health care, the environment, education, crime, drugs. Numbers Are Increasing Furthermore, she finds the number of Catholics in public life “steadily increasing.” In the 93d Congress (197374), there were 114 members of Congress who were Catholic. In the. 94th Congress, there were 124. In the 95th, there were 132. Contrary to another popular belief, they were not all Democrats. Thirtyfive of the Catholic members of the 93d Congress were Republicans. In an interview, Dr. Hanna said she talked with many of the Catholic members of Congress and they told her they tried not to let their religion influence the way they responded to constituents. But, they also said that their Catholicism made a difference in their “value formation,” she said. And she concluded that that could have had some effect on their voting in 1977 on amendments to a bill that would narrow the scope of Federal spending for abortions. She found Catholic Senators twice as likely as the whole Senate to vote for a series of such amendments that year. In the House, similar restrictive amendments drew significantly more support from Catholic Representatives than from members of the House as a whole. Catholics with a political bent alio seem to run for, and win, election to statehouses across the land. There are no fewer than 11 Catholic governors today: Bruce Babbitt of Arizona, Joseph E. Brennan of Maine, Edmund G.Brown Jr. of California, Brendan T. Byrne of New Jersey, Hugh L. Carey of New York, J. Joseph Garrahy of Rhode Island, Ella T. Grasso of Connecticut, Edwin W. Edwards of Louisiana, Thomas L. Judge of Montana, Edward J. King of Massachusetts and Joseph P. Teasdale of Missouri. Those 11 states are the states in which Catholics are the most numerous, too. In earlier days, Catholics kept count of Catholic doctors and lawyers, Catholic center‐fielders and Catholic movie stars. Few now bother, or think it much matters. The film industry in Hollywood, by some accounts, had a greater percentage of Catholics in it 20 years ago than it does now. The Rev. Ellwood Kieser, the Paulist priest‐producer of a long‐standing television series called “Insight,” says, “Hollywood today is strongly Jewish and strongly humanist. But it is very sympathetic to Catholics and almost everything they represent.” Only in academia is there any suggestion that Catholics are underrepresented at the highest levels. Michael Novak, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington says the nation's colleges are “the last place where there's a systematic bias against Catholics.” Only two Catholics have achieved the presidency of a major secular university, he said, Robert J. Kibbee of the City University of New York and William J. McGill of Columbia. But Albert R. Jonsen, a professor of medical ethics at the University of California's medical school in San Francisco, a former president at the Jesuits’ University of San Francisco, points out that for years Catholics inclined toward a university career were recruited for Catholic colleges and universities, which now number 241. More Corporation Heads Now As for Fatner Greeley's statistical lament over the relatively slow rise of Catholics in American corporations, a quick, unscientific check with the president's offices at the Universities of Notre Dame, Fordham and LoyolaMarymount in Los Angeles produced the names of Catholics who are chairmen, presidents and chief executive officers at dozens of major corporations. In his 1977 study of American Catholics, Father Greeley said Catholics did not hold “many important positions” at the television networks. But Father Patrick Sullivan of the Film and Broadcast Division of the United States Catholic Conference had a few names. He cited Jane Cahill Pfeiffer, chairman of NBC; Robert Mulholland, president of the NBC television network; John D. Backe, president of CBS Inc.; Gene F. Jankowski, vice president of the CBS broadcast group; Robert A. Daley, president of CBS entertainment; Thomas Leahy, president of CBS stations division; James E. Duffy, president of ABC television network; Anthony Thomopoulos, president of ABC entertainment; David Burke, vice president and assistant to the president of ABC News; Donald McGannon, chairman of Westinghouse Broadcasting, and Thomas S. Murphy, Daniel Burke and Joseph P. Dougherty, chairman, president and executive vice president, respectively, of Capitol City Communications. The Road to Success Many of these executives would say they have found little, it any antiCatholic prejudices to trip them up. Merlin Michael Witte, 53, president of McCulloch Oil Company in Los Angeles, was graduated from Loyola University in 1949, worked for the Internal Revenue Service for three years, then was brought into the McCulloch Chain Saw Company by another Catholic, who had graduated from Marquette University. “It helped then,” says Mr. Witte, “to have a Catholic friend to get you in. Once I was in, Robert McCulloch Sr. seemed only too glad to have me — and any other Loyola graduates we could get.”"
Lower Miscarriage Risk From Post‐'73 Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/02/archives/lower-miscarriage-risk-from-post73-abortions-risk-fell-after-1973.html,"BOSTON, Oct. 1 (AP) — Women who have abortions conducted with the latest medical techniques face “little or no risk” of suffering unusual numbers. of miscarriages in later pregnancies, a study shows. However, the same report shows that women who had abortions before 1973 — when now‐outmoded abortion methods were common — may face a higher than normal incidence of miscarriage because their reproductive organs could have been scarred. When the information for this study was gathered between 1974 and 1976, the researchers estimated that out of 100,000 pregnant women, 120 would have miscarriages that were caused by previous abortions. An article on the study, which was conducted at the Kaiser‐Permanente Medical Center in Walnut Creek, Calif., was published last week in The New England Journal of Medicine. The researchers studied the pregnancy records of 31,917 women. Among those who had had an abortion before 1973 and before bearing their first child, the rate of miscarriage during the middle three months of pregnancy was more than three times higher than usual. But the relative risk of miscarriages among these women fell to 1.4 times higher if the abortion was conducted after 1973. Before 1973, doctors frequently used dilation and curettage, commonly referred to as a “D and C,” to perform an abortion. They opened the cervix with an instrument and then scraped the uterus with a spoon‐shaped knife. Now most doctors use suction to remove the fetus. Frequently, they also insert laminaria, a Japanese seaweed, to gently open the cervix. The researchers reported that they believed these new techniques accounted for the drop in abortion‐related miscarriages. Women who had already had children were probably spared injury, they said, because their cervixes were easier to open. In a separate paper in the same issue of the journal, Dr. Willard Cates Jr. of the national Center for Disease Control in Atlanta sharply criticized new laws that regulate abortions. He said such rules actually increased the danger of abortions because they required women to delay the operation from one to three days after they had decided to go through with it. Dr. Cates said that at least 26 states and nine cities had these rules, most of them based on a city ordinance in Akron, Ohio. The Akron ordinance requires women to wait at least 24 hours after consulting a doctor about an abortion before having the procedure performed. The ordinance also requires those under 18 years of age to wait 72 hours if their parents cannot be found and told of the planned abortion. “Any action that results in delaying the abortion adds a small but definite increase in the risk of morbidity and mortality to the pregnant woman,” wrote Dr. Cates. “Rather than contributing to the safety of the abortion procedure for the woman, the waiting period and parental‐notification provisions actually add to its dangers.”"
Leaders of Dioceses in the Metropolitan Area,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/03/archives/leaders-of-dioceses-in-the-metropolitan-area-terence-cooke-francis.html,"When the Rev. Terence James Cooke was secretary to his predecessor, Francis Cardinal Spellman in 1957, he learned a lesson. “You can't say yes to everything,” he quoted Cardinal Spellman as having told him. “But whenyou say yes, say it quickly. But take a half hour to say no, so you can show your sympathy for the other fellow's side.” This advice has worked well for Terence Cardinal Cooke, who became Archbishop of New York in March 1968, shortly after the death of his mentor. Despite the pressure, Cardinal Cooke maintains an impression of civility and even his critics note that he often says yes. An effective spokesman for the church, he can display literature endorsing abortion and plead at a news conference: “How can they do this?” He can leave a papal conclave and, without discussing political or social issues, praise “the Holy Spirit for helping us find a new Holy Father.” Terence James Cooke was born on March 1, 1921, on Manhattan's La Salle Street, west of 125th Street, but grew up in the Bronx. His father was a chauffeur and construction worker. His mother died when he was 9, and he was raised by an aunt, Mary Gannon. He attended Cathedral Prep, Cathedral College and St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers. He later received a master's degree in social work from Catholic University and taught at Fordham University for 12 years. He earned a reputation as an administrator when he ran St. Joseph's Seminary from 1954 through 1957. The Cardinal lives in the residence behind St. Patrick's Cathedral. He keeps a busy schedule of meetings and public dinners, but when he is free for the evening, his major activity may be a walk before taking work to his room. One church official said: “If you can get past the people around him, you find he listens. He really cares about people — and more often than not, he says yes.” In the compact Diocese of Brooklyn, the bald pate of Bishop Francis J. Mugavero is a familiar sight through most of the 223 parishes. Children call him “Kojak,” and he thinks that's fine. Bishop Mugavero, the first Brooklyn‐born Bishop to serve the Brooklyn Diocese, reflects the ways of his hometown. Upon his appointment in 1988, he discouraged people from addressing him as “Your Excellency,” saying: “I'm not excellent.” Those who know him say the easygoing style disguises the drive and vision of the Bishop, who has completed the requirements for a doctorate in social work at Fordham University and who was a top administrator of Catholic Charities in Queens and Brooklyn, which make up the diocese, for 18 years. Before becoming Bishop, he approved funds so welfare recipients could organize a lobbying group. He criticized the Vietnam War before most other Catholic leaders did. And he has been criticized by conservative Catholic groups. Francis John Mugavero, born on June 8, 1914, was raised above his father's barbershop on DeKalb Avenue, in the Bedford‐Stuyvesant section. He spoke Italian before he spoke English, and the memory of his own brushes with intolerance made him insist that foreign languages be used Brooklyn's ethnic churches. He attended Cathedral Prep, Cathedral College and Immaculate Conception Seminary Huntington, L.I. The Bishop lives modestly. Bill Kenkelen of the weekly National Catholic Reporter tells of his “bumming cigarettes,” still being upset over the Brooklyn Dodgers’ flight to California in 1957, reading mystery novels and being “buddy buddy” with chefs at “moderately priced” Italian restaurants. From time to time, in his thick Brooklyn patois, Bishop Mugavero can be heard to say, “We are all V.I.P.'s in the eyes of the Lord — huh?” In his early days as a parish priest, Bishop John R. McGann knocked on doors in Brentwood, L.I., inviting people to his church. He was so persuasive over a cup of coffee in suburban kitchens that the church could not hold the crowds, and masses were offered in a drive‐In theater. The parish became known as St. Anne's Drive‐In Church, Bishop McGann recalled, noting that many people needed to be invited before they would go to church. The Bishop of the Diocese of Rockville Centre — the ninth largest in the United States — has been a leader trying new ways to run parishes since being installed in 1976. He has encouraged more participation by priests and lay people in the future directions of the diocese. His first assignment was to St. Anne's in Brentwood, and in 1957, when the Diocese of Rockville Centre was split off from Brooklyn, Bishop McGann was named an assistant chancellor. He later served as a secretary to Bishop Walter P. Kellenberg before succeeding his mentor in 1976. The 190‐pound, 5‐foot‐10‐inch leader described himself as a “moderate progressive, not afraid of change” when he took his post, and he has lived up to his own billing. He recently issued strong statements condemning cross‐buntings and said the diocese did not endorse the idea of clergymen belonging to segregated country clubs. In an interview shortly after becoming Bishop, he said he felt the church should make it easier for loyal Catholics have marriages annulled. He has urged Catholics to follow the Vatican's teaching on birth control, but said it has had “an agonizing effect on many people.” Bishop McGann has criticized Sunday openings by department stores, saying that “unnecessary work or shopping, all that smacks of commercialization of Sunday, should be avoided.” When the Most Rev. Peter L. Gerety was named Roman Catholic Archbishop of Newark in 1974, most people expected him to move into a mansion in the fashionable Llewellyn Park section of West Orange, where his predecessors had lived. Instead, he chose to move into a three‐room apartment at the rectory next door to Sacred Heart Cathedral because, he said, “I'd like to be in the City of Newark.” Since his installation, the Archbishop has remained a constant presence in the archdiocese, redrawing lines of authority and listening to members of the ethnic and economic groups in the four‐county area. However, the 66‐year‐old Archbishop has been labeled an “enigma” by some observers, perhaps partly because he has remained closer friends from past posts in New England. Peter Leo Gerety, who was born on July 19, 1912, in Shelton, Conn., studied at St. Thomas Seminary in Bloomfield, Conn., and at St. Sulpice Seminary in Issy‐les‐Moulineaux, France, where he became an admirer of French culture and cuisine. He was ordained at the Cathedral of Notre Dame Paris in 1939 before becoming assigned to New Haven. In 1969, he was appointed Bishop of Portland, Me., where he gained the reputation for saving a debt‐ridden diocese, a skill that would come in handy in Newark. In Maine, he acquired a 24‐foot sloop, which he now enjoys sailing on Long Island Sound. Archbishop Gerety has been identified with the new bishops who have been appointed through the Vatican's Apostolic Delegate, the Most Rev. Jean Jadot. He has been active in civil‐rights causes and has supported boycotts nonunion grapes and lettuce and defended the rights of conscientious objectors not to serve in Vietnam. He was a supporter of the 1976 Call to Action Conference, which seemed to many to herald a new era for American Catholics."
House Balks at Ending Recess to Take Up Fund Bill,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/03/archives/house-balks-at-ending-recess-to-take-up-fund-bill-bill-not.html,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 2 (AP) — House members today refused to cut short their vacation to consider a Senate measure that would enable the Government to pay its bills and also revoke a pay increase for Congress and top Federal employees. Only a handful of House members attended a session that had been scheduled as a formality. House officials said they had been assured that no harm was being done to the Government while they took a week‐long recess. There was no word on whether the House would pass the bill even when it did meet. The House wants stronger language limiting Federal financing of abortions than the Senate bill contains. Another irritant could be the Senate's decision yesterday to rescind a 12.9 percent cost‐of‐living raise that went into effect at midnight Sunday. The House had wanted a 5.5 percent raise, an increase of $3,200 a year over the current Congressional salaries of $57,500. The House session today lasted only 15 minutes. There was no discussion of the bill, and fewer than a dozen members were on the floor. No substantive business can be transacted in the 435‐member chamber unless at least half its members are present, but House leaders said earlier that there would be no action even if a quorum did show up. Representative Jamie L. Whitten, Democrat of Mississippi, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said that the House might appoint conferees Friday to work out a compromise with the Senate next week. The emergency bill is needed because Congress has not provided funds for some of the biggest Government departments, such as Defense; Housing and Urban Development; Health, Education and Welfare; Transportation; Agriculture; and Labor. Those agencies technically ran out of authority to finance their programs at midnight Sunday, For now, the departments are getting by on money left over from the just‐expired fiscal year. But that cash is expected to run short in a couple of weeks, and that means the House will have to act quickly if it does not come back until next week. Federal workers are being urged to stay on the job and to have faith that their paychecks will come, even though their October salaries are being jeopardized by the deadlock. The lack of Congressional appropriations for the majority of Federal departments and programs has resulted in the following: Transportation Department officials have been instructed to curtail all but “absolutely essential” activities. Labor Department inspectors were ordered to use their own cars, except in emergencies, instead of using commercial vehicles. Checks for 4,000 VISTA volunteers scheduled to be mailed yesterday have been held back. Benefit checks for 44,000 victims of black‐lung disease and widows of victims will not be mailed Friday. An official at the Office of Management and Budget said that the problems encountered this week were small in comparison with those that would develop next week if the impasse continued. Starting next Sunday, the Government will be unable to “certify” payrolls because the money has not been authorized for spending, said the buget official, who did not wish to be identified. That could hold up Government paychecks even if Congress acts quickly after the House returns Oct. 9 from its 10‐day Columbus Day recess. Veterans Administration benefits are not likely to be affected unless the impasse continues for a long time. Social Security and Supplemental Security Income checks will go out this week as usual because they had previously been “certified for payment,” said Jim Brown, a Social Security spokesman."
"80,000 Gather in Yankee Stadium for Historic Papal Mass",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/03/archives/80000-gather-in-yankee-stadium-for-historic-papal-mass-pope-exhorts.html,"More than 80,000 cheering worshipers greeted Pope John Paul II at Yankee Stadium last night, a few straining to touch his waving right hand as he rode past the center field seats, the rest expressing their devotion with applause, flashbulbs and the chanting of his name. From his entrance from the rightfield bullpen, through his 10‐minute ride past the stands, until he stepped onto an altar ringed with chrysanthemums, the mood was joyous. But the Pope delivered a homily more in the spirit of the distressed South Bronx exhorting the overwhelmingly white crowd to show a “special sensitivity toward those who are most in distress, those who are extremely poor, those suffering from all the physical, mental and moral ills that afflict humanity.” The Pope reminded those attending the mass of the “urgent need” of service to the poor. “There are many in your own midst,” he said. He had expressed concern for the poor throughout the day, and earlier, during his stop in the South Bronx, he was told by the Rev. Neal A. Connolly, vicar of the South Bronx, “Your presence here tonight means that we count.” The crowd was the largest at Yankee Stadium since Pope Paul VI drew an audience of more than 90,000 for a mass on Oct. 4, 1965, the first time a pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church celebrated mass on American soil. At that time the stadium seated 67,000, but a remodeling in the mid‐70's reduced the capacity to 57,545. About 13,000 persons, including a choir of 1,200 voices from a half‐dozen dioceses, were seated on folding chairs on the playing field. Like Pope Paul VI, Pope John Paul II spoke from a consecrated altar placed in the vicinity of second base. The altar was of simple translucent plastic fringed in gold, quite unlike the tubular steel altar from which he celebrated mass on the Boston Common Monday afternoon. Papal and United States flags hung from the facade in center field, and homemade banners hung from the grandstands. The banners ranged from simple messages of welcome to anti‐abortion statements. In his 1965 homily, Pope Paul VI emphasized loving, understanding and serving the cause of peace. Pope John Paul II repeatedly stressed sharing. He referred to the Gospel parable of the rich and selfish man who died and found eternal torment, not for his wealth but for his refusal to pay attention to a needy man. “The life style of many of the members of our rich and permissive societies is easy, and so is the life style of increasing groups inside the poor countries,” he said, condemning “a frenzy of consumerism, exhausting and joyless,” and a human condition that he said gives “full rein to the instincts of self‐interest, sex and power.’ The mass started at 9 P.M., one hour late, the furthest the Pope had fallen behind his schedule in his two‐day‐old tour of the United States. The City Council's majority leader, Thomas J. Cuite, suggested that “collections would drop way off” should a parish priest be so tardy, but few of those waiting seemed to mind. “We've been waiting so long to see the Holy Father, another hour or two doesn't matter,” said Sister Patricia Iagrosso of the Congregation of St. Felix in Infield, Conn. Local politicians found a use for the time. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and Governor Carey signed autographs. Mayor Koch worked the crowd. The Governor, looking at the assembled multitudes, called the mass “the World Series of religion:, Mayor Koch arrived with a white cardboard box containing 10 rosaries which he said were for the Catholic members of his staff and would be blessed by the presence of the Pope. Also attending the service was Princess Caroline of Monaco. Helen Hayes, the actress, participated in the service, reading from Genesis. A force of 5,000 police were in the Bronx, including 2,000 along the route of the motorcade, 2,000 in the area of the Stadium and 1,000 inside. The mass ended just before 11 P.M. with the Pope's final words, “Go in peace.” Pope John Paul II then walked around the four sides of the altar, his arms outstretched to the crowd. His people erupted in cheers and rhythmic clapping, chanting, “Long live the Pope.” At 11:41 P.M. the Pope's limousine pulled up in front of Cardinal Cooke's residence on Madison Avenue between 50th and 51st Streets. As he stepped out of the car, applause and cheers went up from a crowd of about 3,000. The Pope put his palms together and tilted one cheek against them to indicate he would be going to sleep. Then he blessed the crowd, made the sleep gesture again and, with Cardinal Cooke at his elbow, went into the residence. Inside, he appeared in a window and waved. Again, the crowd cheered and applauded. Across from the residence, about 50 Polish‐Americans, had climbed onto construction fence and begun singing in Polish. They kept singing, banging their feet on the fence and rhythmically applauding, the way young people do when they are appealing for an encore performance at a rock concert. After a few minutes, a policeman with a bullhorn approached the singing men and women. “Attention. Attention,” the policeman said. “The Pope has had a long, tiring day and hopes to get some rest. Would you please stop. Thank you.” They began to sing more softly, but they did not disperse. The policeman with the bullhorn spoke again: “You want to clear the area please?” They moved away from the residence a bit, but kept singing. Finally, about 30 police officers began closing in on the singers urging them to move, in some cases pushing them. There were some complaints, but within a few minutes the street outside the residence where the Pope would sleep was quiet."
"In Philadelphia, Pope Condemns Sexual ‘Laxity’",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/04/archives/in-philadelphia-pope-condemns-sexual-laxity-pontiff-attacks-laxity.html,"PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 3 — Pope John Paul II was welcomed by exuberant crowds here this afternoon and, in a mass attended by hundreds of thousands of people at Logan Circle, emphasized basic human freedoms while warning against “laxity regarding the Christian view on sexuality.” Implicitly upholding Roman Catholic teachings against abortion, divorce and artificial birth control, the Pope turned for the first time in this country to a conservative theme he had emphasized in Ireland last weekend at the start of his 10day journey. As the Pope began his overnight stay here, the skies began to clear and cooler, invigorating air moved into the area. Foul weather had made his flight from La Guardia Airport in New York an hour late. Among those greeting the Pontiff at the Philadelphia airport were John Cardinal Krol, Gov. Dick Thornburgh of Pennsylvania and Mayor Frank Rizzo of Philadelphia. Hundreds of young people waved flags as the Pope stepped off the plane, and the freshman class from Cardinal O'Hara High School held aloft 700 placards. “Philadelphia Welcomes His Holiness John Paul II With Our Love,” the signs read, in English on one side and in Polish on the other. Leaving the airport in a motorcade, the Pope rode in an open‐topped limousine and proceeded to the Cathedral of Saints ‘Peter and Paul, where he prayed and gave an apostolic blessing. From the cathedral rectory he continued to Logan Circle, where he said mass from a platform atop a long, red carpet. In his homily, the Pope lauded American principles of freedom but reminded his audience, thick with priests and nuns, that freedom must be tempered by the “knowledge of truth” as taught by the Catholic Church. “Freedom can therefore never be construed without relation to the truth as revealed by Jesus Christ, and proposed by his church,” the Pope declared, “nor can it be seen as a pretext for moral anarchy, for every moral order must be linked to truth. “This is especially relevant when one considers the domain of human sexuality,” he continued. “Here, as in any other field, there can be no true freedom without respect for the truth regarding the nature of human sexuality and marriage. “In today's society, we see so many disturbing tendencies and so much laxity regarding the Christian view on sexuality that have all one thing in common: recourse to the concept of freedom to justify any behavior that is no longer consonant with the true moral order and the teaching for the church. Moral norms do not militate against the freedom of the person or the couple; on the contrary they exist precisely for that freedom, since they are given to ensure the right use of freedom.” This lesson, he said, applied not only “to the whole of conjugal morality” but also “to the obligations of celibacy” for priests. In urging restraint in a society that permits broad choices, the Pope was addressing a problem that has occupied much of his attention on his visit. He has lauded the Western concepts of human rights but cautioned against what he sees as permissiveness and moral corruption that sometimes stem from such freedom. The Pontiff praised basic American freedoms as “paramount in the political and social order, in relationships between the government and the pea ple, and between individual and individual.” But, he said, “man's life is also lived in another order of realities: in the order of his relationship to what is objectively true and morally good. Freedom thus acquires a deeper meaning when it is referred to the human person.” In his strongest assertion of the higher claim of religious truths, he said, “divine law is the sole standard of human liberty and is given to us in the Gospel of Christ, the Gospel of Redemption.” The Pope said that “confronting” human values with the Gospel message encourages believers to “assume more fully your duties and obligations toward your fellow human beings.” After the mass, the Pope dined at Cardinal Krol's residence, and visited the St. Charles Seminary before returning to the Cardinal's residence for the night. He was to travel to Des Moines and Chicago tomorrow. The crowds that greeted him — perhaps 5,000 at the airport and some 500,000 at Logan Circle — had come from Pennsylvania's coal mines and Ohio's farms and factories to see what one 17‐year‐old Polish boy from the Manayunk section of the city said was “the man who is as close as we can come to God.” There was an air of festival about the day for which this city had spent weeks preparing and squabbling, and for which the finishing touches were being applied only this morning. Throngs of children and their parents crowded the route of the caravan that carried the Pope from the airport south of the city to the cathedral near the center of town. The route was lined with American, papal and the blue‐and‐gold City of Philadelphia flags. There were banners across the roadway and balloons in the gold‐and‐white papal colors were released as his limousine approached. Uniformed policemen lined the caravan route, stationed some 10 yards apart on both sides of the roadway for several blocks. All along the Pope's route for today and tomorrow, the city filled potholes and washed away or painted over graffiti on street signs and walls. But the clean‐up was limited to only one side of the signs, as the Pope was not to travel in the opposite direction on any of the same streets."
Excerpts From Homily At Mass in Philadelphia,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/04/archives/excerpts-from-homily-at-mass-in-philadelphia-strengthening-human.html,"Philadelphia is the city of the Declaration of Independence, that remarkable document, containing a solemn attestation of the equality of all human beings, endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights: life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, expressing a “firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence.” PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 3 (AP)— Following are excerpts from the text of Pope John Paul II's homily for the mass at Logan Circle: These are the sound moral principles formulated by your Founding Fathers and enshrined forever in your history. In the human and civil values that are contained in the spirit of this declaration there are easily recognized strong connections with basic religious and Christian values. A sense of religion itself is part of this heritage. The Liberty Bell, which I visted on another occasion, proudly bears the words of the Bible: “Proclaim liberty throughout the land.” This tradition poses for all future generations of America a noble challenge: “One nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.” As citizens, you must strive to preserve these human values, to understand them better and to define their consequences for the whole community and as a worthy contribution to the world. As Christians, you must strengthen these human values and compliment them by confronting them with the Gospel message, so that you may discover their deeper meaning, and thus assume more fully your duties and obligations toward your fellow human beings, with whom you are bound in a common destiny. How then can a Christian, inspired and guided by the mystery of the incarnation and redemption of Christ, strengthen his or her own values and those that are embodied in the heritage of this nation? These values are strengthened when power and authority are exercised in full respect for all the fundamental rights of the human person, whose dignity is the dignity of one created in the image and likeness of God; when freedom is accepted not as an absolute end in itself, but as a gift that enables selfgiving and service; when the family is protected and strengthened, when its unity is preserved, and when its role as the basic cell of society is recognized and honored. When the Liberty Bell rang for the first time in 1776, it was to announce the freedom of your nation, the beginning of the pursuit of a common destiny independent of any outside coercion. This principle of freedom is paramount in the political and social order, in relationships between the government and the people, and between individual and individual. However, man's life is also lived in another order of realities: in the order of his relationship to what is objectively true and morally good. Freedom thus acquires a deeper meaning when it is referred to the human person. It concerns in the first place the relation of man to himself. Every human person, endowed with reason, is free when he is the master of his own action, when he is capable of choosing that good which is in conformity with reason, and therefore with his own human dignity. Freedom can never tolerate an offense against the rights of others, and one of the fundamental rights of man is the right to worship God. Christ himself linked freedom with the knowledge of truth. “You will know the truth and the truth will make you tree.” In my first encyclical I wrote in this regard: “These words contain both a fundamental requirement and a warning: the requirement of an honest relationship with regard to truth as a condition for authentic freedom, and the warning to avoid every kind of illusory freedom, every superficial unilateral freedom, every freedom that fails to enter into the whole truth about man and about world.” Freedom can therefore never be construed without relation to the truth as revealed by Jesus Christ, and proposed by his church nor can it be seen as a pretext for moral anarchy, for every moral order must remain linked to truth. St. Peter, in his first letter, says: “Live as free men, but do not use your freedom for malice.” No freedom can exist when it goes against man in what he is, or against man in his relationship to others and to God. This is especially relevant when one considers the domain of human sexuality. Here, as in any other field, there can be no true freedom without respect for the truth regarding the nature of human sexuality and marriage. In today's society, we see so many disturbing tendencies and so much laxity regarding the Christian view on sexuality that have all one thing in common: recourse to the concept of freedom to justify any behavior that is no longer consonant with the true moral order and the teaching for the church. Moral norms do not militate against the freedom of the person or the couple; on the contrary, they exist precisely for that freedom, since they are given to insure the right use of freedom. Whoever refuses to accept these norms and to act accordingly, whoever seeks to liberate himself or herself from these norms, is not truly free. Free indeed is the person who models his or her behavior in a responsible way according to the exigencies of the objective good. What I have said here regards the whole of conjugal morality, but it applies as well to the priests with regard to the obligations of celibacy. Divine law is the sole standard of human liberty and is given to us in the Gospel of Christ, the Gospel of redemption. But fidelity to this Gospel of redemption will never be possible without the action of the Holy Spirit. It is the Holy Spirit who guards the life‐giving message entrusted to the church. It is the Holy Spirit who insures the faithful transmission of the Gospel into the lives of all of us. It is by the action of the Holy Spirit that the church is built up day after day into a kingdom; a kingdom of truth and life, a kingdom of holiness and grace, a universal kingdom of justice, love and peace. Today, therefore, we come before the Father to offer him the petitions and desires of our hearts, to offer him praise and thanksgiving. We do this from the city of Philadelphia for the universal church and for the world. We do this as “members of the household of God” in union with the sacrifice of Christ Jesus, our cornerstone, for the glory of the most Holy Trinity."
News Summary,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/04/archives/news-summary-the-papal-journey.html,"THURSDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1979 The Pope bade a warm farewell to New York yesterday before departing for Philadelphia. Shifting from the role of world statesman to that of attentive shepherd, Pope John Paul II turned a rain‐drenched crowd at Shea Stadium into an exuberant parish gathering. [Page A1, Column 6.] The Pope arrived in Philadelphia yesterday afternoon where hundreds of thousands of people attended a papal mass in the city and heard the Pontiff deliver a speech that implicity upheld the Roman Catholic teachings against abortion, divorce and artificial methods of birth control. [A1:5.] A crowd of 11,000 teen‐agers greeted Pope John Paul II at Madison Square Garden. The young people were full of spirit and joy as they cheered, roared and sang their greeting to the Pope, who responded with “wows” in Polish, and pronounced the outpouring “a charismatic moment.” [A1:5‐6.] More than 60,000 filled Shea Stadium to hear Pope John Paul II, who, on the last day of his visit here, spoke to New Yorkers about the special qualities of their city in four of its languages. The Pontiff's speech, which was constantly interrupted by applause, moved many to tears. [B1:6.] Praise from non‐Catholic leaders has greeted Pope John Paul II in the first three days of his trip to the United States, though some religious leaders have said the Pope could have been more specific in his calls for disarmament and social justice. Generally, Jewish and Protestant leaders stressed the humanity, the ecumenical spirit and the evangelical zeal of the special visitor from Rome. [B2:3‐5.] International In the event of a worldwide war with the Soviet Union, the United States should take steps to involve China in the conflict, according to a secret Defense Department study on American military policy in Asia. The New York Times obtained a copy of the study, which urges the United States to bolster China's military potential to enable Peking to aid the West in the event of a major war. [A1 : 1.] A constitution for Zimbabwe Rhodesia was put forward by Britain, which said the draft would be the last one offered at the constitutional conference being held in London. British officials asked for agreement on the draft by Monday. Observers thought the Government of Bishop Abel T. Muzorewa would be generally agreeable to the proposals but that the Patriotic Front guerrilla alliance would have serious reservations. [A1 : 2.] A major shift of power in Britain's Labor Party — away from the party's traditionally more moderate faction and in favor of a group dominated by leftists — took place at the party's annual conference. The shift came through changes adopted in party rules and it represented a devastating defeat for former British Prime Minister James Callaghan. [A5:1‐3.] National The possibility of evacuating nearby residents would have been considered on the first day of the accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor had the five members of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had all the information available to their staff and the operator of the nuclear reactor, the commission members told a Senate panel. [A15 : 1.] A political upset in Cleveland saw the city's embattled Mayor, Dennis J. Kucinich, defeated in the nonpartisan mayoral primary by Lieut. Gov. George V. Voinovich, the state's top Republican vote‐getter. Mr. Voinovich outpolled Mayor Kucinich by 11,228 votes. The two candidates will face each other in a runoff in the general election Nov. 6. [A16:4‐6.] Possible violations of Federal law were uncovered by the Senate Select Committee on Ethics in its long investigation into Senator Herman E. Talmadage's finances. The committee would only say that it had uncovered about six possible violations, but sources close to key members said the Justice Department had been asked to take a closer look at the Georgia Democrat and several of his top aides. [A16:1.] Metropolitan Parole was granted to former Newark Mayor Hugh J. Addonizio yesterday after the United States Parole Commission abandoned its two‐year fight to return him to Federal prison. Mr. Addonizio was released from prison in April 1977 after serving five years of a 10year sentence for conspiring with underworld figures to extort $1.4 million from contractors doing business with the city. [B16:3‐6.] Student protests were criticized by City School Chancellor Frank J. Macchiarola who said that high school students throughout the city had been “manipulated” by their athletic coaches. Students have been boycotting classes and staging protest rallies in support of a job action by coaches, and the Chancellor promised police action to prevent further demonstrations during the school hours. [B10:3‐4.] Testimony and tapes were presented by Federal prosecutors in an effort to show that Anthony M. Scotto, a leader of the International Longshoremen's Association, had purchased a $26,485 sports car to conceal cash from the Internal Revenue Service.

Poor Women and the Merciless House,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/04/archives/poor-women-and-the-merciless-house.html,"In what is becoming an annual event, the Federal Government again has had to start a new fiscal year with its budget in limbo because the House insists on being pinched and stubborn about abortion. Abortions are sanctioned by the Supreme court, and poor women who needed them used to turn Medicaid for payment, as for other medical costs. In recent years, Congress has sharply cut abortion payments, limiting them to women who are victims of rape or incest or whose health is endangered. That is restrictive enough, the Senate thinks; not so the House. It would ban Medicaid payments for all abortions except those in which a mother's life itself is threatened. Moreoever, the House has insisted on attaching this requirement to the 1980 appropriations bills for several Federal departments and even to the Congressional pay‐raise bill. The House's view seems merciless to us. We urge the Senate, despite intense pressure to cave in, to persist — and prevail. Until a few years ago, Washington paid for over a quarter million abortions annually. But as the antiabortion movement has gained influence, the House has taken a progressively harder line. Each year it has proposed highly restrictive amendments to assorted appropriations measures. The Senate repeatedly approved more liberal provisions that would allow Federal payments whenever abortions seemed medically necessary. The result has been compromise. This year, even the Senate has retreated to the compromise language of existing law. It should retreat no further. Why should a poor victim of rape or incest have to bear a child that results from a terrible crime? Why should the amount of money a woman has determine her decision? Yet if the House has its way, what are the choices? A woman can give up and let such a baby be born. She can turn to quacks or self‐induced abortion. Or she can try to pay for competent treatment by using meager welfare allotments. In desperation, many do just that; they save for months for an abortion, only to get to a physician or clinic too late to have one. Congress has largely achieved its restrictive purpose in cutting Federal aid for abortions. Since the amendment was adopted two years ago, the number of Medicaid‐assisted procedures has plummeted. Recent Gallup polls show nearly a quarter of all Americans favor abortions under any circumstances and that an additional 54 percent approve in cases of rape, incest and risk to the mother's life or health. The strength as well as the humanity of such public sentiments ought to weigh heavily in the coming House debate."
Slow Pace of Congress,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/05/archives/slow-pace-of-congress-legislation-is-stalled-by-conflicts-over.html,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 4 — Last Monday was New Year's Day for the fiscal year 1980. By that date the Federal budget was supposed to have been in place and the money to pay the bills was supposed to have been appropriated. But when the new year dawned, the budget was still snagged in a struggle between the House and Senate, and most appropriations bills were a long way from the President's desk. Moreover, a stopgap measure to provide temporary financing for many Government departments was blocked by disputes over abortion and Congressional pay increases. Major tax legislation that would affect Government revenues for the fiscal year was still mired in the Senate Finance Committee. Congress has never been very good about meeting deadlines, and the delays this year will have few immediate effects. But the legislature's inability to get its work done on time also illustrates the political crosswinds now buffeting Capitol Hill and the country as a whole. A growing Congressional workload, conflicts over spending priorities, rising constituent pressure and declining party loyalty all slow down the pace of legislation. This led Senator Edmund S. Muskie, Democrat of Maine, to comment recently, “The people are unhappy with Congress because it represents them too well.” More Recess Than Work The biggest problem is the Congressional schedule. In the last nine weeks, the lawmakers have had more recess than work time. Moreover, Congress virtually works a three‐day week in Washington these days, mainly because so many members — particularly Representatives, for whom elections come every two years — are continually flying home to their districts. This does not mean that the lawmakers are goldbricking; they just feel it is necessary for their political survival to keep their fences mended. Many younger members, lacking any party base, have to create and maintain personal political organizations, and this takes considerable time and energy from their legislative chores. The schedule problem is aggravated by the proliferation of subcommittees and Congressional staffs, which, in turn, produces a blizzard of legislative proposals. Many lawmakers are often scheduled to be three places at once, and the House Budget Committee frequently has trouble rounding up enough members to do its work. Many members feel the pressure to go home often in part because they feel so vulnerable on so many issues. “Modern transportation and communications are very important,” said one long‐time Sen. ate aide. “Fifty years ago, how often did a senator from California go home? Maybe twice a year? And how often was his vote reported back home? Today, if he votes on abortion, it's reported on local TV that night, long before he has a chance to explain.” On and Off the Record Accordingly, courage is not a very widely displayed quality on Capitol Hill these days, and one of the best examples was the House's gyrations over its own pay increase. The members endorsed the raise when they could vote anonymously, but then reversed themselves when forced to vote on the record. “So much demagoguery goes on,” re marked Representative Leon E. Panetta, Democrat of California, “that you have to force a crisis in order to draw out of members a responsible approach.” The lawmakers feel that their vuinerability is enhanced by the growth of single‐issue groups. The abortion foes, who have helped stall key appropriations bills, are probably the best example. “The members are afraid of the bullet vote,” said one aide to the House leadership. “They're afraid that somebody will vote against you only because of your position on one issue, like abortion. And in a swing district, those votes can have substantial effect on the outcome.” Perhaps the stickiest problem of all this year is that the budget process is working; it is forcing Congress to confront a series of choices and tradeoffs and, at a time of tight budgets, those choices can be very painful. When Interests Conflict Senate conservatives want more military spending, House liberals want more domestic programs, and everyone wants lower deficits, but these aims are often directly in conflict. “People are learning,” said one budget committee staff member, “that there's not that much to cut.” If those problems were not enough to tie up Congress, the lawmakers are also slowed down by their own internal political fights. On the Senate side, for example, the whole spending picture has been complicated by the annual manuevering of Senator Russell B. Long, chairman of the Finance Committee. As usual, the Louisiana Democrat has delayed action on key tax legislation and allowed a sense of urgency to build up. One Senate staff member described the Long strategy this way: “As it gets later in the year, people are more anxious to go home, and pressure grows to accept the bill. The schoolis‐out syndrome takes over.” In addition, the Congressional leadership has lost much of its ability to appeal to party loyalty or to exert party discipline. As a result, even carefully crafted compromises are often hard to sell, and the budget was a good example. In the House, the leadership lost 67 Democrats on the first vote this fall, when the budget failed and 52 on the second vote, when was barely passed. “People get elected right off the street to Congress,” said Representative Joseph J. Moakley, Democrat of Massachusetts. “They don't have any political loyalties or i.o.u.'s.” Despite all these difficulties, Congress should eventually get together and pass most of the important bills on its agenda. As one long‐time Senate staff aide said, “The situation is hopeless, but not serious.” Solomon Names New Aide Kenneth S. Schuman has been appointed executive director of New York City's Office of Economic Development. Peter J. Solomon, Deputy Mayor for Economic Policy and Development, announced Mr. Schuman's appointment yesterday. Mr. Schuman, 35 years old, had been serving as deputy executive director since February. He previously held executive positions with the Lower East Side Family Union, the Queens County Mental Health Society and the Hudson Guild. His salary as executive director will be $50,000 a year."
WASHINGTON Things We Forget,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/05/archives/washington-things-we-forget.html,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 9 —At the very least, Pope John Paul II has demonstrated something we have forgotten in America and even tend to deny: that a solitary individual with strong convictions and noble aspirations still touches the heart of a vast continental nation. It is precisely the doubt on this point that has eroded the faith of so many, and led to such cynicism among the squabbling leaders of this political community. What difference, people ask here, would it really make if Kennedy replaced Carter as the Democratic Party's nominee for the Presidency in 1980? Or if Reagan, Connally, Baker, Ford, or somebody else took over the White House for the Republicans? The general view here is that all the candidates for the leadership of the Republic are trapped in a complicated system of 35 state primary elections, popularity polls, fund‐raising drives and television spectaculars. But so far, none of them have touched the spirit and longing of the people as the Pope has done in the last few days. All the political leaders here have been playing games with the political problems of the day. President Carter has been pretending he was changing the “status quo” in Cuba with a series of meaningless military demonstrations out of Key West. His political opponents, specifically John Connally and Senator Baker, have been playing politics with his dilemma by saying that, confronted by the Soviet challenge, he was weak. He “blinked,” they said, not defining what they would do if he turned a minor controversy in Cuba into a major world confrontation with the Soviet Union. The Pope of Rome has been taking wholly different view of the controversies between nations. He has been saying that the “security” of the Western world does not lie in its military arms alone, but in its moral authority, in its faith in itself, and in its compassion for the suffering and starving peoples of the world. He has clearly not come to the Western Hemisphere‐which he calls “the continent of hope” - to congratulate us on our material success, but to condemn it. The paradox of his visit is that he has been so successful with the people, while so critical of their way of life. With the possible exception of Solzhenitsyn, he has condemned the moral anarchy, sexual license, and material consumerism in this country more than any other social critic. Yet somehow, despite his condemnation of our spiritual bewilderment, he has been received here with more applause than any other religious or secular leader in the world. This is not going to lead to any kind of religious reformation, or popular belief in the Roman Catholic faith - his stern views on contraception, abortion, celibacy and religious training in the family divide even his own parishioners. But his faith and conviction still influence the moral apathy of the age. What the Pope has done - at least here in Washington - is to make people in high office realize the force of moral conviction. To make them remember that they are not merely bureaucrats who propose laws, but that they are also the custodians of the nation's ideals, of the hopes and faith that sustain it from one generation to another, and that anybody in office, or seeking office, can be important in promoting these ideals. This is an important lesson for Washington these days. It has begun to doubt its ability to govern, even to reach any kind of consensus on the great issues of public policy. The President, as chief executive officer of the Republic and Commander in Chief, has not been able to get the consent of the Congress for the policies he believes are vital to the security of the Republic. Likewise, the leaders of the majority members of the Congress Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia and Speaker Tip O'Neill of Massachusetts in the House of Representatives - are defied so often by members of their own party that they have begun to wonder if any voice in whatever exalted office has any influence at all on public opinion. But Pope John Paul II has somehow cut across all these doubts. He has brought us back to elemental things, and shown that even a lonely voice, crying for the beliefs we have lost, can be important. “This is the way of greatness,” Walter Lippman wrote back in 1943. “In the supreme moments of history, terms like duty, truth, justice, and mercy‐which in our torpid hours are tired words - become the measure of decision. We, unhappily, are acting as if we had forgotten them. ,We seem to be ashamed to utter them, in part because we tremble at the gibes of the Philistines, but in the main because they are remote from our habitual feeling .. .. We are trying to be too shrewd, too clever, too calculating when what the anxious and suffering peoples cry out to us for is that we practice the elemental virtues and adhere to the eternal verities. They alone can guide us through the complications of our days.

POPE FIRMLY DEFENDS CHURCH RESTRICTION ON CONTRACEPTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/06/archives/pope-firmly-depends-church-restriction-on-contraception-denounces.html,"CHICAGO, Oct. 5 — Pope John Paul II, deploring “onslaughts of materialism, rampant secularism and moral permissiveness,” today issued the staunchest defense of Roman Catholic teachings on sexuality that he has made in his current visit to the United States. Included in that defense was the church's ban on artificial birth control. While the Pope had voiced agreement with most of these teachings before his visit, his unequivocal reaffirmation of his positions on a broad range of moral issues took on added significance because so many American Catholics have dissented from the church's sexual guidelines. The Pope, apparently aware of these deep divisions, acknowledged that church law must be taught despite inevitable criticism. Fidelity to Catholic Doctrine The Pope's views were consistent with his theme of the need for unity in the face of growing pluralism in the American branch of the church, as reflected in divisions among the hierarchy. Today's views were presented to the 250 United States Catholic bishops, meeting in closed session at Quigley South Seminary. The meeting was part of an itinerary that took the Pope to a small Polishlanguage mass and another mass attended by hundreds of thousands of people on Chicago's lakefront. [Page 10.] In the longest address so far on his Journey, the Pope emphasized fidelity to Catholic doctrine and underscored the authority of the bishops while appearing subtly and gently to rebuke them for failing to uphold church law firmly enough. Quoting from recent statements by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, the official arm of the American hierarchy, the Pontiff counseled the bishops to teach “the sacred deposit of truth” by defending such stands as the church's rejection of divorce, homosexual practice, premarital and extramarital sexual relations and artificial contraception. No Mention of Annuiments “In exalting the beauty of marriage,” the Pope said, “you rightly spoke against both the ideology of contraception and contraceptive acts, as did the encyclical Humanae Vitae. And I myself today, with the same conviction of Paul VI, ratify the teaching of this encyclical, which was put forth by my predecessor ‘by virtue of the mandate entrusted to us by Christ.” The Pope referred to the pastoral letter by the bishops three years ago, “To Live in Christ Jesus,” as a basis for his defense of these traditional moral teachings. Observers noted that he did not comment on granting of marriage annulments, which has become a more Irequent practice in recent years. Last year, an estimated 30,000 annulments were granted by church tribunals. While the Pope did not directly criticize the actions of the bishops, he held their own official statements up to them and implicitly suggested that stronger efforts to promote them were in order. There had been much speculation that the Pope would attempt to instill greater discipline in the American hierarchy because of alleged liberalizing trends that have crept into the church in the United States in recent years. Even at the time that the pastoral letter was approved by the Catholic bishops, by a vote of 172 to 23, there was unexpectedly strong opposition from many of the laity and from bishops who argued that lacked sufficient compassion for those Catholics who experience difficulty obeying church proscriptions on birth control, divorce and abortion. Archbishop John R. Roach of Minneapolis, vice president of the conference of bishops, conceded that the Pope may have sounded negative but denied that the Pope had intended that result. “You can take a portion of this statement and rhaps consider it scolding,” Archbishop Roach said. “I don't think it was.” The Pope's statement to the bishops, combined with his strong backing for the rules of celibacy and an an‐male priesthood earlier this week, portray him as strict constructionist on church law. By contrast, he has been widely considered left of center on social issues, particularly in his support for human rights, expressed most forcefully on this visit by his speech at the United Nations. In other parts of today's speech, the Pope noted the need for ecumenical but ruled out, for the present at east, intercommunion among churches. “We must pray and study together,” he said, “knowing, however, that intercommunion between divided Chistians is not the answer to Christ's appeal for perfect unity.” Though the Pope has expressed support for the princitlit of ecumenism from the start of his re , many of those involved in interfaith re tions await concrete signs of what initiative he might take. Services of Reconciliation In his statement, he also urged the bishops to reverse the sharp decline in participation in the sacrament of penance or confession and appeared to chastise those bishops who have held services of “reconciliation” whereby divorced and remarried Catholics have received general absolution. Under church rules, there are very few circumstances that allow for the granting of general absolution ‐ forgiveness to an entire group without prior individual confession to a priest. Some bishops have been moving toward greater flexibility, but the Pope seemed to oppose this move. He also seemed aware of the challenge to the authority of bishops in recent years widespread ddec- detections from the tera and disagreement with official teachings, many of them in the area of sexuality. In addition, the bishops have been in tension with theologians who contend that traditional views must change in response to new, historical factors. The Pope said that fidelity to church law would entail difficulty. “Brothers in Christ,” he said, “as we proclaim the truth in love, it is not possible for us to avoid all criticism; nor is it possible to please. But it is possible to work for the real t of everyone.”"
WESTCHESTER JOURNAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/07/archives/westchester-weekly-westchester-journal.html,"”EVERYONE knows,” writes John Cheever, “that the first marathon, in the fifth century B.C., was run through some fairly uninteresting country west of Athens” while “the oldest and most famous marathon in the western world is mapped through the dreary suburbs north of Boston.” Not so today's first Ossining Town 22Kilometer Road Race and Four‐Mile Fun Run. “Where else in the world,” asks the Pulitzer Prize‐winning author, who lives on Cedar Lane in Ossining, “can you run a marathon and see the romantic pinnacle of High Tor, the noble Hudson River at its broadest and the splendid bridge that spans this breadth?” And where else can you find a souvenir booklet with Mr. Cheever's essay on running and bicycling, or his son Ben's thoughts on being a participant? There is a piece by Susan Green on other local races — participants covered water, ice, dirt tracks and unpaved roads —while Greta Connell deals with Ossining's history and Betsy Brown the route, assuming anyone is able to appreciate the many fascinating sights. The booklet will be available, according to Gloria Fried, who has organized the entire affair, with the purchase of a T‐shirt at the start of the run on Ryder Road near the Maryknoll Seminary, or at the finish at the school on Brookside Lane. The race begins at 1:30 P.M. It ends with a country fair at 3 o'clock, for some; perhaps 4 o'clock or 5 o'clock for others. It was April 8 when a starter's gun on the Post Road launched the 10th annual Scarsdale 15‐kilometer run and opened this year's rash of marathons, minimarathons, half‐marathons and 5‐mile to 33‐mile races. Is today's the last of the season? If so, it would be an ironic finale, because it is Ossining's first. Not that racing is new for the community, which became the county's first incorporated village — as Sing Sing, after the Sinck Sinck Indians — in 1813. As early as 1968 local bettors were cheering winners in the old Brookside Trotting Park. “Straight and sulky races as well as bicycle events attracted the sporting crowd for miles around,” according to the booklet. The turn of the century saw automobiles replace trotters, with touring cars careening around a 32‐mile course that extended to Kensico, a former village now under lake waters held by a dam of the same name. There were sailing races, contests on ice and even soapbox derbies. The route begins near one of the most interesting structures in Westchester, the Maryknoll Seminary with its pagoda‐style roof and mandarin red pillars a reminder of the Catholic Foreign Mission Society's interest in China It passes a former silver mine, a former copper mine and the Jug Tavern, a landmark from the Revolutionary period that is now being restored. Runners will pass under the high walls and towers of the former Mount Pleasant State Prison, which came to be better known as Sing Sing, the name of the village. Embarrassed by living in a community with the same name as a penal institition, Sing Sing became Ossining in 1901. In the 1960's, the institition changed its name — to the Ossining Correctional Facility. The landmarks of three centuries dot a route that undulates from 550 feet to 65 feet and back up again. But that's routine for Westchester marathons, and perhaps the reason for their proliferation in recent years. • More than 100,000 families in Westchester County could be affected by domestic violence if statistics here follow national patterns, according to estimates in a report by the county's Domestic Violence Program. Of that number, between 7,500 and 15,000 would be potential cases of child abuse, 20,000 to 28,000 abused parents and some 50,000 abused spouses. The projections are the result of a yearlong study of domestic violence in the county. The 46‐page report was released last week. The report shows that in the average case of a battered wife, the woman is married, white and a high school graduate. The composite, based on 115 cases of wife abuse reported at the county's Department of Probation, further describes the battered wife as a woman who has not filed more than one previous complaint. The woman's accusation most often indicates that the physical violence is primarily aggravated by alcohol. Although the county provides a number of services to aid victims of domestic violence through its Department of Social Services and the Mental Health Association of Westchester, there appears to be a growing need to increase and expand these services, according to Betti White, coordinator of the Domestic Violence Program. “Many services already existing in the Department of Social Services can be utilized in domestic violence cases,” the report concluded. “While there is a need for additional shelters and counseling services, there are also needs which could be met by ongoing training and the sensitizing of personnel throughout the whole agency.” The Domestic Violence Program's report also recommended that three new shelters, each handling five to seven clients, be developed in small rented apartments or homes and located in northern and central Westchester. The report also suggested that the county's 42 police departments be encouraged to give higher priority to family‐dispute calls and that cases involving repeated or severe violence be prosecuted. The unit also urged that information on domestic violence be provided bimonthly though the Domestic Violence Newsletter. • Gary Russell, the new dean of students at Manhattanville College, is trying not to refer to floors as decks, walls as bulkheads and bathrooms as heads. He is doing better, he says, but it hasn't been easy: “I don't even realize I'm using them.” The 37-year-old Mr. Russell, a 1964 graduate of the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Conn., was a career Coast Guardsman until he was forced to retire early because of a diabetic condition that would have prevented him from serving at sea. He then he went to the State University of New York's Maritime College in the Bronx as dean of students and, later, director of administration. Mr. Russell, who also has a master's degree from Wesleyan University in history and government and another from the University of Connecticut in political science, said that he had not found any one “overwhelming” issue on campus. The 1,390 students — 450 of whom are men — seem most concerned, he said, with the “problems they have had with their residential life. “What they would like from the dean's office is a little direction, visibility, someone who is concerned with their immediate problems and fair treatment for all students in disciplinary matters,” he asserted. “It might be something in the dorms that needs repair, or the food service, which got off to a shaky start — the day to day living .” To look after such things, the dean has assistants for student affairs, student activities, residences and career planning. There is a psychiatrist and a psychologist, along with two doctors and a nursing staff at at the health service. One of the dean's major goals, he said, is to “enhance” student spirit — to keep looking for new ways to “get more students involved in more activities.” That applies particularly to the 400 students who commute. The dean was asked about drug use on campus. His answer reflected not only changing times, but Manhattanville's transition from a thoroughly Catholic school for well‐to‐do young women to a coeducational, nonsectarian institution of increasingly diverse views. The dean said he “assumed” that marijuana could be purchased on campus. He had been asked about his views on drugs, he said, when he was interviewed for the job by a student committee. He said he told them: “Don't throw it up in my face and don't put me in a position where I have to take official action.” “I don't think I'm capable of changing their view of society,” he said, “but people should be free of infringements on their rights by flagrant drug users.” As far as birth control is concerned, he said, the college's health center provides a series of lectures in student residence halls that cover “the whole range.” He added: “I personally feel very strongly that information should be made available on birth control.” Including abortion? Describing the issue as “too personal” for him to offer advice, Mr. Russell said he would refer any interested student to the staff gynecologist. “I don't even know his views toward abortion, nor would I ask,” he said. Such a question, he said, would come up only between the student and the gynecologist, a referral would be made upon request and the matter would never come to his attention. Coed dormitories are the rule at Manhattanville and there are no curfews or regulations on visiting hours, except for one floor in one dorm that is exclusively occupied by women who set their own rules. “They seem very adult in their ability to handle that situation,” Mr. Russell said, referring to the student body as a whole, and “there are a lot of good friendships that develop. They're not so concerned with racing to date one another as we were.” At the Maritime College, he said, one was “overwhelmed by maleness.” Manhattanville has enough males so that when “you walk on campus, it strikes you as a coed campus. “I don't think the men suffer from the feeling that there are only a couple of them and they have to struggle to survive,” he said. The dean, who is separated from his wife, has two daughters, aged 10 and 12, who visit on weekends, vacations and summers. He is living in a dormitory suite now, but will move into a house on campus when it is renovated. “If my daughters said they wanted to go the SUNY Maritime, I'd sit down with them and explain my reservations,” he said. “If they decided to go anyway, I'd say fine. “But if they said they wanted to go to Manhanttanville, I'd say great. There is something very positive about the student body up here. They seem to appreciate what they have and seem very concerned that it stay that way.” A Run With a View ... New ‘Commander’ For Manhattanville"
Deadlock in Congress Recalls 1962 Fiscal Impasse,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/07/archives/deadlock-in-congress-recalls-1962-fiscal-impasse.html,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 6 — Amused observers dubbed it the Congressional banana war: an octogenarian deadlock that sent everybody from the President on down scrambling to find money to keep the Government operating. That 1962 Senate‐House impasse over crucial money bills is being re‐enacted this year, but this time with a new cast of characters and a different kind of script. Seventeen years ago, the key issues were which side of the Capitol should be used for Senate‐House conference meetings, whether a senator or a representative should preside and whether the Senate should share in originating money bills. Congress has changed drastically since that time, and such matters of protocol are no longer considered important. The current Senate‐House deadlock over a bill to allow Federal departments and agencies to continue spending at last year's levels, pending passage of their own appropriations bills, hinges on a subject seldom mentioned in polite society 17 years ago: abortion. With the House insisting on strict abortion standards and the Senate equally adamant in support of a more liberal stance, the continuing approprations bill to provide funds for departments and agencies in the new fiscal year that began Oct. 1 was scuttled last week. Since the House is in recess until next Tuesday, no quick end of the impasse is in j sight. And while the delay may cause some minor disruptions in Government operations, heads of departments and agencies do not seem overly concerned. The 1962 deadlock was fir graver, with some Government programs unable to function fully. It all began in the spring of that year when the Senate and the House passed differing versions of a bill on supplemental appropriations for a variety of Government programs. The usual procedure in such cases, then and now, is for Senate‐House conferees to meet and negotiate their differences. That spring, Senator Carl Hayden of Arizona, the 84‐year‐old chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, insisted that the conferees meet on the Senate side of the Capitol, just as their predecessors had done for nearly 180 years. No way, said Representative Clarence Cannon of Missouri, the 83‐year‐old chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. It was time for the Senate conferees to march over to the House side of the Capitol. The distance between the two chambers is about the length of a short city block. A temporary truce came a few weeks later when conferees met in what was known as the Old Supreme Court Chamber, a room just slightly over the Senate line in the Capitol. But it was a shortlived peace. Representative Cannon insisted that a House member be named chairman, thus breaking tradition. Senator Hayden, in turn, demanded that the Senate be allowed to initiate half of all appropriations bills, instead of having them all originate in the House. The impasse dragged on well past the beginning of the new fiscal year, which at that time was July 1. Finally, on July 20, the Senate and House conferees trooped into the Old Supreme Court Chamber once again. There, Senator Spessard Holland, Democrat of Florida, pulled a quarter out of his pocket and said: “Heads or tails?” “Heads,” said Representative Albert Thomas, Democrat of Texas. He won the toss, became chairman of the conference, and the deadlock ended."
POPE ENDS U.S. VISIT WITH CAPITAL MASS AFFIRMING DOCTRINE,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/08/archives/pope-ends-us-visit-with-capital-mass-affirming-doctrine-denounces-a.html,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 7 — After a final flourish of celebration and worship, Pope John Paul II headed home for Rome tonight, leaving American Catholics with his strongest admonition to “stand up every time human life is threatened” by abortion, weakened marital standards and the limiting of family size for material comfort. The Pope's message, while an affirmation of the church's traditional teaching, was stressed as his final guidance for the Transcript of Pope's homily, page B6. American church, broadcast over national television at the end of his weeklong, 6,000‐mile pilgrimage to six American cities. ‘Tell Them, Boy!’ “Human life is precious because it is the gift of a God whose love is infinite,” he told scores of thousands gathered for worship on the Mall. “And when God gives life, it is forever.” “Tell them, Boy! Tell them!” a Knight of Columbus in a plumed costume shouted, one voice in a strong reaction of approval that surged through the crowd as the Pope's message echoed across the Mall. The Pope left this evening, having blessed America and, for a dramatic moment this morning, having heard a nun's pleading voice at the altar of Catholicism's national shrine that there be female priests someday. Returned Students’ Cheer’ In his farewell message, delivered before his 8:45 departure from Andrews Air Force Base, he said: “Today, therefore, my final prayer is this: that God will bless America so that she may increasingly become, and truly be and long remain, ‘one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.’” He completed his tour in characteristic fashion, beginning his day by breaking into the cheer of a crowd of Catholic University students and chanting back: “I love you! I love you!” And he ended it with a solemn mass amid the monumental architecture of the nation's capital. The sweeping, at times frenetic, papal visit captured the attention of the nation, which saw John Paul speak to the United Nations on human rights, visit rural and ethnic parishes, and greet President Carter at the White House with some strong words in behalf of arms limitation. Through the week, he was hailed as the Vicar of Christ and studied as a master celebratory capable of riveting Catholic and non‐Catholic, believer and nonbeliever. “It's the best thing that ever happened to the country,” said William J. Doell of Rochester as he stood in the throng gathered for the final mass of the Pope's visit, set on a high altar amid a burst of choral and liturgical pomp. “It used to be that you had to be elite to see the Pope. Now the poor can see him.” Similar comments of respect and admiration have been sounded all week through days of motorcades and celebrations here and in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Chicago and Des Moines. The tone was no less respectful this morning when Sister M. Theresa Kane, welcoming the Pope to an address before 5,000 nuns at the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, looked to the Pontiff and declared that the church , “must respond” to its concern for each person's dignity “by providing the possibility of women as persons being included in all ministries of our church.” Instantly, applause broke out across the handsome, cavernous church. John Paul looked to be concentrating closely as Sister Theresa, the president of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, pleaded with him to consider the question in the light of the “powerful messages of our church addressing the dignity and reverence for all persons.” Response in Address The Pope pursed his lips, leaned back with his fingertips touching in churchsteeple fashion, and listened. After Sister Theresa finished to additional applause, the Pope responded, in effect, in his address. The address, which he had written in advance, was a discourse on Mary, the mother of Christ. He, too, drew applause as he cited the traditional role of religious sisters: “Like John the Baptist, you know that for Christ to increase, you must decrease.” Fifty‐three of the 5,000 nuns in attendance stood in silent demurral during the Pope's message. This was distinct from the reaction to Sister Theresa's message to consider the dignity and suffering of women as persons, which drew a large and broad‐based reaction. As he finished in a larger context, on the theme of love of Christ as the key to all religious lives, John Paul drew a standing ovation. And hand after hand was extended to him by the sisters as he walked down the aisle, blessing them all, smiling warmly. The other emotional high point of the day occurred during the mass on the Mall when the Pope stirred much of the crowd with a strong endorsement of the American church's Respect Life program. Indirect Blow at Moral Order “If a person's right to life is violated at the moment in which he is first conceived in his mother's womb,” the Pope declared, “an indirect blow is struck also at the whole of the moral order.” Like other constituencies in the Ameri can church, faithful Catholics who support the antiabortion movement had been waiting all week for special words of address from the Pope, and John Paul was interrupted repeatedly with applause and cheers as he attacked abortion. In repeating his condemnation of artificial birth control, John Paul went beyond his earlier emphases this week and dwelled on the question of how many children a family should have. “Decisions about the number of children and the sacrifices to be made for them must not be taken only with a view to adding to comfort and preserving peaceful existence,” the Pope said. Rather, he said, parents should “remind themselves that it is certainly less serious to deny their children certain comforts or material advantages than to deprive them of the presence of brothers and sisters.” “And so,” Pope John Paul told the gathering, “we will stand up every time that human life is threatened.” He linked a chain of conditions in his theme of “We will stand up” — for the unborn, against marriages “abandoned to human selfishness,” for families threatened by social and economic pressures and against the abuse of freedom to “dominate the weak.” ‘Defend the Unborn’ His final plea from the altar was “to defend the life of the unborn and to render more human the lives of all our fellow human beings, wherever they may be.” The Pope's final day in the United States was devoted largely to churchly missions. After addressing the nuns, he spoke in quick succession to a gathering of theologians and educators at the field house of Catholic University, and to gathering of non‐Catholic religious leaders at Trinity College. Once, when the Pope appeared in his car in a rapidly accelerating motorcade, Mary Stewart Walker, a teacher from Bethesda, Md., extended her hand. The Pope reached for her. Their hands touched for an instant. Then she found herself stumbling downward as a motorcycle policeman rode over her leg. “I put out my hand and he put out his hand, and they touched,” said the woman, disheveled but delighted. “I didn't care what happened after that. I'm all right. I got to see and touch the Pope.”"

"At a Catholic College, Sexes Differ in Views of Pope",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/08/archives/at-a-catholic-college-sexes-differ-in-views-of-pope-difference-in.html,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 7 — One Georgetown University student said that Pope John Paul II “has the courage to lead the church like it is supposed to be led.” Another said that the strict tenets espoused by the Pontiff could “make your life miserable.” Both are 18 years old, Catholic and freshmen at this Jesuit school, which is nearly two‐thirds Catholic. The difference is that one is male and one is female. “If I ever became pregnant,” said Helen Gordon of Manhasset, L.I., “I would have an abortion and feel guilty because of my religion. The church can lay so much guilt on you it can make your life miserable. That's a part of the Catholic religion I don't accept. “I think he's come here to tell Catholics that all is not lost and there is something to believe in. At the same time, he's a little medieval. He's a Pope but he's also a male.” Difference in Views Catholic males at Georgetown, perhaps predictably, seemed less concerned about doctrinal dilemma than Catholic women. Three freshmen hurrying down M street last night were carrying bedrolls to the Mall, where the Pope celebrated mass today. The expression on their faces was expectant, although the event was still more than a half‐day away. “He's telling us that our religion is good, that we don't have to look outside it for meaning,” said Daniel McConville of Hollywood, Calif. “It's as though someone had laid this message away for years in the tombs under the Vatican and he is bringing it out. Everybody might not like what he is saying, but at least he has the courage to lead the church like it is supposed to be led.” For some students, both Catholics and non‐Catholics, the impact of Pope John Paul II was no different from that of a rock star. His magnetism was compared with that of Elvis Presley. The preparations taking place at the mall for the celebration of the mass reminded one women of a Frank Zappa concert, “only with a cleaner stage crew.” One student said that he had been moved much more by the Pope's pilgrimage to Poland, where the reaction of the people did not include the manufacture of papal T‐shirts. The student body of Georgetown was essentially conducting Saturday night business as usual this weekend. Offcampus residents filled the scarred tables and lined up to play the pinball machines at Gruncher's on M street. Freshmen flocked to the basement of Healy Hall for the opportunity to buy 50‐cent beers at the Campus Pub. On Way to Vigil at Mall Occasionally, a determined figure in a parka walked by with camping equipment, on the way to an overnight vigil at the Mall, or the intense voice of an angered female could be heard in the bars, penetrating even the rock‐androll. A Presbyterian student at Georgetown, Amy Dickinson, said that she had been struggling all week with a decision on whether to sing for the Pope with the 80‐voice university chorus or picket the Pope “with a bunch of longhaired women.” The university sent its chorus to the Mall to participate in today's papal mass, a prospect that thrilled Miss Dickinson until she learned about the Pope's views on birth control and abortion. She comes from Freeville, N.Y., where she and her family are active in the National Organization for Women. “I think the Pope will strengthen the Catholic Church but at the same time thrust a lot of women's issues back,” she said. “All my anti‐Pope feelings aside — we Presbyterians have a lot of those, you know — I'm really glad he's there.” But for Miss Dickinson, a mezzoso‐ prano who twice decided that she could not possibly sing for the Pope and twice changed her mind, the decision finally came. “I think if it was another person, I wouldn't have to go,” she said, “but this man is amazing, he has so much power and I think he is using it in the best interests of the church and in the social interests of all people. Everyone wants to feed the poor but only he can call for it.” This is how Miss Dickinson, who ended up believing in a man with whom she can do nothing but disagree, found herself part of a combined chorus of 1,000 voices. She was in the first row."

Moral Issues In Ecumenism,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/08/archives/moral-issues-in-ecumenism-pope-alters-emphasis-of-interfaith.html,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 7 — In a move that has major implications for interfaith relations, Pope John Paul II declared today before the leaders of American religious groups that ecumenical progress must be linked to a resolution of differences “over moral and ethical matters.” By emphasizing the importance of agreement between the Catholic views of sexuality and those of other churches, the Papal Journey: An Analysis Pope shifted the ground of ecumenical discussion from theological topics, such as the nature of the Eucharist, to variations in belief on moral issues. This poses new problems for ecumenical talks. The Pope urged the religious leaders to give a “joint witness” to human rights, social justice, “esteem for the sacredness of marriage” and the “support of a healthy family life.” He continued, “In this context, recognition must be given to the deep division which still exists over moral and ethical matters. The moral life and the life of faith are so deeply united that it is impossible to divide them.” The Pontiff was apparently alluding to the contrast between such Catholic stands as rejection of divorce, artificial birth control and abortion and the more liberal positions of many other churches. The Pope's remarks were made to 250 Protestant, Eastern Orthodox and nonChristian leaders in a brief service in the chapel of Trinity College, a Catholic women's college in the northeastern section of the city. Seated in a semicircle with the Pope on the altar of the Notre Dame chapel were the leaders of those churches that have been engaged in ecumenical talks with the Catholic church. Commitment to ‘Perfect Unity’ The Pope commended the efforts to find interfaith accords in the United States and repeated his commitment to the goal of “perfect unity in Christ.” “Much has been accomplished but there is still much to be done,” the Pope said. “We must go forward, however, with a spirit of hope. Even the very desire for the complete unity in faith — which is lacking between us, and which must be achieved before we can lovingly celebrate the Eucharist together in truth — is itself a gift of the Holy Spirit, for which we offer humble praise to God.” Many non‐Catholic churchmen believe the Pope has outlined a tough position on ecumenism during his visit because he has insisted that interfaith unity must be built on assent to what the church calls “the totality of truth,” which it believes Catholicism has received. The Pope appears to many Protestant leaders to reflect much of the concept of the “one true church” that was abandoned by the Second Vatican Council. “I'm quite sure he wants unity,” said the Rev. Carrington Paulette, president of the District of Columbia Baptist churches, “but I don't know how much priority he will give to it.” Other leaders were disappointed that the prayer service was the only official ecumenical activity during a week in which he has visited a nation that is more religiously pluralistic than any other he has toured since becoming Pope. While the Pope states a sincere desire for church unity, some leaders say, he has implicitly discouraged them from thinking that progress would come soon. The exception seems to be in his for reunion with Eastern Orthodoxy. Few Major Changes ‐conversations are in progress witn our brothers from the East, the Orthodox,” the Pope said. “Here I wish to note that this relationship has been strong in the United States and that soon a theological dialogue will begin on a worldwide basis in an attempt to resolve those difficulties which hinder full unity.” Since the Second Vatican Council, groups of theologians and biblical scholars from several large denominations have conducted discussions on doctrinal issues including the concepts of baptism, the ministry, the office of the Pope and the Eucharist. In many instances, significant breakthroughs have been achieved. But few agreements have so far resulted in major changes in policy. Though Anglicans and Roman Catholics have concurred on the nature of the Eucharist, for example, the members of the two church bodies still do not share the sacrament because of objections from the Cathoalic side. This inability to gather around a communion altar is often cited as an especially painful acknowledgement of division, and on the same day of the prayer service large numbers of non‐Catholics were joining in a common observance of “World Wide Communion Sunday.” The Pope paid tribute to the continuing efforts to reach unity. “I wish to pay homage here to the many splendid ecumenical initiatives that have been realized in this country through the action of the Holy Spirit,” the Pope said. “In the last 15 years there has been a positive response to ecumenism by the bishops of the United States. Prayer for the Relationship “Through their committee for ecumenical and interreligious affairs,” he continued, “they have established a fraternal relationship with other churches, a relationship which, I pray, will continue to deepen in the coming years.” Seated with the Pope were Archishbop lakovos, primate of the Greek Orthodox Archidiocese of North and South America; Bishop Papken Varjabedian, legate of the Washington, D.C., Armenian Church of North America; Bishop John H. Burt, of the Episcopal Church; Dr. Paul A. Wee of the Lutheran World Federation; Bishop James K. Mathews of the United Methodist Church; Dr. James I. McCord, president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches; Dr. Paul Stauffer, of the Disciples of Christ, and Dr. Porter W. Routh, of the Southern Baptist Convention."
Mood at NOW Conference Is Businesslike as E.R.A. Is Pushed,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/08/archives/mood-at-now-conference-is-businesslike-as-era-is-pushed-issues.html,"LOS ANGELES, Oct. 7 — At the 12th annual convention of the National Organization for Women, many of the nearly 3,000 members who attended were struck by the corporate tone that prevailed, which was underlined by the similarity in dress of the delegates. All wore green and white on Saturaay, me unofficial colors of NOW, which were the colors of the suffragist movement 50 years. With more than 100,000 members, paid staff of five and a convention delegate system that effectively limits the representation of the more radical activists and members of minority groups, NOW has entered a phase that appears to have given it increasing visibility and political power. But at the same time, in the views of some feminists, the intent of the nation's largest feminist organization has been compromised. ‘As the feminist movement has become more accepted and more broad‐based, it has meant some compromises.’ “What are we doing with a $3.5 million budget,” asked Marjorie MacEwan, a 46‐year‐old Cleveland shop steward. “What the devil is NOW talking about investments for. This is supposed to be a grass roots organization, not a corporation.” “NOW has definitely changed its approach,” said Aileen Hernandez, who was president of the organization for 18 months in 1971‐72. The San Fransiscobased urban consultant was the only black president of the group. “As the feminist movement has become more accepted and more broad‐based, it has meant some compromises,” she ac knowledged. “Unfortunately, it has meant more structure and I'm not excited about structure. And NOW is too white and middle class. We have not addressed the issue of NOW's new identity or raised the question of racism.” The only minority member running for a national office was Sharon Parker, who addressed the convention in Spanish, and then English, but who lost her bid for secretary. Elected for two years was a slate of officers headed by the current president, Eleanor C. Smeal. Mrs. Smeal, who came to head NOW after a political split two years ago, was a housewife from Pennsylvania with a master's degree in political science and public administration before taking the $39,000‐a‐year job as president of the organization. “In the last two years NOW has doubled in size. And we have had to concentrate our efforts on the ratification of the equal rights ammendment and the extension of the ratification date,” she said. “Of course we recognize that we must dramatically increase minority participation.” Elected with Mrs. Smeal were Judy Goldsmith as vice president; Jane Wells Schooley as vice president of the action project; Sandra Reeves Roth as secretary, and Alice Chapman as treasurer. Issues Before Convention Some of the issues on which the convention was acting to set policies included child care, homosexual rights, reproductive rights, health care and employment. The conference lacked the excitement of earlier meetings, when internal politics rocked the delegations and feminists such as Gloria Steinern and Betty Friedan welded power. There were no stars of that magnitude in attendance, even though the convention had chosen Los Angeles, where E.R.A. supporters Candice Bergen, Alan Alda, Norman Lear and Marlo Thomas work. Except for a small, brief demonstration by individuals opposing the convention's reproductive rights position and its support of abortion, the mood was decidedly calm. “NOW is undergoing a transition, the whole women's movement is,” said Susan Caudill, a NOW member from Texas who has attended all but two of the past 12 conventions. “Feminism has become respectable. There is a price for that. And, if feminism wants to be political, there is a price for that too.” The organization, which has focused its attention on the ratification of the equal rights amendment by the 1982 deadline, has labeled the “radical right” its enemy and moved to strip away what its leaders say are false issues that have complicated passage of the ammendment. “We don't have to talk about unisex bathrooms, we want to get back to the issue of equal rights for women,” Mrs. Smeal said. I think women have been getting the shaft for years,” said Eugene Parvin, one of the first male delegates to the NOW convention. The 43‐year‐old insurance adjuster from Dupage County, Ill., is confident that the amendment is not something that will take away rights from men. “In fact, when both the husband and wife are working, if the woman gets paid less than a man doing the same job, it hurts the whole family.” What some people also overlook, he added, is that the E.R.A. “can also give me as an older man job security, if keeps business from getting rid of man with seniority at 50 in order to hire two younger women at the same pay.” Brenda Sheppard, a member from Detroit said the movement for the equal rights amendment had “bz ought together more diverse people than perhaps any other movement.” She added, “For a long time, NOW had trouble focusing on an issue. We had a resolution for everything. Some of them called for projects we could never undertake, like eliminating world hunger. We couldn't do that.” Miss Sheppard, 26 years old, who took a bus to Los Angeles and stayed with friends in order to attend, said she had dropped out of the Detroit chapter “during the political years when all we did was squabble about goals.” She became active again, she said, “with the E.R.A. thrust.” Despite the success NOW has had attracting members and money around its campaign for the equal rights amendment, the organization has had some difficulty keeping some of its chapters vigorously active in the drive for the amendment. “When their states were ratified, many of the chapters sort of felt their job was done,” said Sheila Clark, president of the Illinois group. “Because Illinois has not ratified, we have been one of the most active organizations.” In the women's organization's “E.R.A. Strike Force Plan,” Illinois is a key state, primarily because it is the only northern industrial state which has not ratified the equal rights amendment and because it is the home state of one of the strongest opponents of the amendment, Phylis Schafly. “I'm not sure that I approve of NOW becoming so political,” said Esther Bailey, a nurse from Seattle. “I think we are getting away from the reasons why many of use joined NOW. It is important that we win the ratification of the E.R.A., but it shouldn't take all our resources. I don't like to see the resouces of the local chapters going for projects in other states when there are needs at home.” The 1980 campaign strategy of the women's organization calls for the election of NOW supporters to political offices and the ouster of “turncoat” legislators who ran on pro‐E.R.A. slates and accepted money and campaign assistance and then denied their support to the amendment. The convention did not endorse a Presidential The 1980 campaign strategy calls for the ouster of ‘turncoat’ legislators who ran on pro‐E.R.A. slates then denied support to the amendment. candidate and no Presidential candidates were invited to speak, although California Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. was allowed to talk briefly when he appeared one night. Despite the convention's focus on the 1980 political campaign, many of the delegates came for other reasons. For the first time, NOW has invited a coalition with labor, which has supported the organization's economic boycott of convention facilities in states that have not ratified the E.R.A. Mrs. Smeal, who was raised as Roman Catholic, criticized Pope John Paul II for the church's position in opposition to birth control, which he restated during his visit to the United States. Mrs. Smeal, wearing a blue armband in support of Catholic feminists, said: “I believe that the overwhelming majority of Catholics in this country believe in equality of women. They practice birth control and believe in it. We cannot and won't go backwards. He will find it is as difficult as putting toothpaste back into the tube.”"
Transcript of Pontiff's Homily at Mass,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/08/archives/transcript-of-pontiffs-homily-at-mass-let-the-children-come-renewed.html,"Dear brothers and sisters in Jesus Christ: In His dialogue with his listeners, Jesus was faced one day with an attempt by some Pharisees to get Him to endorse their current views regarding the nature of marriage. Following is a transcript of Pope John Paul IVs homily at the mass on the Mall yesterday afternoon, as recorded by The New York Times: Jesus answered by reaffirming the teaching of scripture: “At the beginning of creation God made them male and female; for this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and the two shall become one. They are no longer two but one in flesh. Therefore let no man separate what God has joined.” The Gospel according to Mark immediately adds the description of a scene with which we are all familiar. ‘Let the Children Come’ This scene shows Jesus becoming indignant when he noticed how his own disciples tried to prevent the people from bringing their children closer to him. And so he said: “Let the children come to me and do not hinder them. It is to just such as these that the Kingdom of God belongs. Then he embraced them and blessed them, placing his hands on them.” In proposing these readings, today's liturgy invites all of us to reflect on the nature of marriage, on the family and on the value of life — three themes that are so closely interconnected. I shall all the more gladly lead you in reflecting on the word of God as proposed by the church today, because all over the world the bishops are discussing marriage and family life as they are lived in all dioceses and nations. The bishops are doing this in preparation for the next World Synod of Bishops, which has as its theme: “The Role of the Christian Family in the Contemporary World.” Your own bishops have designated next year as a year of study, planning and pastoral renewal with regard to the family. Renewed Interest in Family For a variety of reasons tnere is a renewed interest throughout the world in marriage, in family life, and in the value of all human life. This very Sunday marks the beginning of the annual Respect Life program, through which the church in the United States intends to reiterate its conviction regarding the inviolability of human life in all stages. Let us then, all together, renew our esteem for the value of human life, remembering also that, through Christ, all human life has been redeemed. I do not hesitate to proclaim before you and before the world that all human life — from the moment of conception and through all subsequent stages — is sacred, because human life is created in the image and likeness of God. Nothing surpasses the greatness or dignity of a human person. Human life is not just an idea or an abstraction; human life is the concrete reality of a being that lives, that acts, that grows and develops; human life is the concrete reality of a being that is capable of love, and of service to humanity. Indirect Blow at Moral Order Let me repeat what I told the people during my recent pilgrimage to my homeland: “If a person's right to life is violated at the moment in which he is first conceived in his mother's womb, an indirect blow is struck also at the whole of the moral order, which serves to ensure the inviolable goods of man. “Among those goods, life occupies the first place. “The church defends the right to life, not only in regard to the majesty of the Creator, who is the first giver of this life, but also in respect of the essential good of the human person.” Human life is precious because it is the gift of a God whose love is infinite, and when God gives life, it is forever. Life is also precious because it is the expression and the fruit of love. This is why life should spring up within the setting of marriage, and why marriage and the parents’ love for one another should be marked by generosity in self‐giving. The great danger for family life, in the midst of any society whose idols are pleasure, comfort and independence, lies in the fact that people close their hearts and become selfish. 2 Loves Side by Side The fear of making permanent commitments can change the mutual love of husband and wife Into two loves of self — two loves existing side by side, until they end in separation. In the sacrament of marriage, a man and a woman — who at baptism became members of Christ and hence have the duty of manifesting Christ's attitudes in their lives — are assured of the help they need to develop their love in a faithful and indissoluble union, and to respond with generosity to the gift of parenthood. As the Second Vatican Council declared: “Through this sacrament, Christ himself becomes present in the life of the married couple and accompanies them, so that they may love each other and their children, just as Christ loved his church by giving himself up for her.” In order that Christian marriage may favor the total good and development of the married couple, it must be inspired by the Gospel, and thus be open to new life — new life to be given and accepted generously. The couple is also called to create a family atmosphere in which children can be happy, and lead full and worthy human and Christian lives. To maintain a joyful family requires much from both the parents and the children. Each member of the family has to become, in a special way, the servant of the others and share their burdens. Each one must show concern, not only for his or her own life, but also for the lives of the other members of the family: their needs, their hopes, their ideals. Decisions about the number of children and the sacrifices to be made for them must not be taken only with a view to adding to comfort and preserving a peaceful existence. Reflecting upon this matter before God, with the grace drawn from the sacrament, and guided by the teaching of the church, parents will remind themselves that it is certainly less serious to deny their children certain comforts or material advantages than to deprive them of the presence of brothers and sisters, who could help them to grow in humanity and to realize the beauty of life at all its ages and in all its variety. If parents fully realized the demands and the opportunities that this great sacrament brings, they could not fail to ‘All human beings ought to value every person for his or her uniqueness as a creature of God.’ join in Mary's hymn to the author of life — to God — who has made them his chosen fellow‐workers. All human beings ought to value every person for his or her uniqueness as a creature of God, called to be a brother or sister of Christ by reason of the incarnation and the universal redemption. For us, the sacredness of human life is based on these premises. And it is on these same premises that there is based our celebration of life all human life. This explains our efforts to defend human life against every influence or action that threatens or weakens it, as well as our endeavors to make every life more human in all its aspects. And so, we will stand up every time that human life is threatened. When the sacredness of life before birth is attacked, we will stand up and proclaim that no one ever has the authority to destroy unborn life. Unrepeatable Gift of God When a child is described as a burden or is looked upon only as a means to satisfy an emotional need, we will stand up and insist that every child is a unique and unrepeatable gift of God, with the right to a loving and united family. When the institution of marriage is abandoned to human selfishness or reduced to a temporary, conditional arrangement that can easily be terminated, we will stand up and affirm the indissolubility of the marriage bond. When the value of the family is threatened because of social and economic pressures, we will stand up and reaffirm that the family is “necessary not only for the private good of every person, but also for the common good of every society, nation and state.” When freedom is used to dominate the weak, to squander natural resources and energy, and to deny basic necessities to people, we will stand up and reaffirm the demands of justice and social love. When the sick, the aged or the dying are abandoned in loneliness, we will stand up and proclaim that they are worthy of love, care and respect. Quotes Pope Paul VI I make my own the words which Paul VI spoke last year to the American bishops: “We are convinced, moreover, that all efforts macle to safeguard human rights actually benefit life itself. Everything aimed at banishing discrimination — in law or in fact — which is based on race, origin, color, culture, sex or religion is a service to life. “When the rights of minorities are fostered, when the mentally or physically handicapped are assisted, when those on the margin of society are given a voice — in all these instances the dignity of life, and the sacredness of human life, are furthered. “In particular, every contribution made to better the moral climate of society, to oppose permissiveness and hedonism, and all assistance to the family, which is the source of new life, effectively uphold the values of life.” Much remains to be done to support those whose lives are wounded and to restore hope to those who are afraid of life. Courage is needed to resist pressures and false slogans, to proclaim the supreme dignity of all life, and to demand that society itself give it its protection. Jefferson on Government A distinguished American, Thomas Jefferson, once stated: “The care of human life and happiness and not their destruction is the just and only legitimate object of good government.” I wish therefore to praise all the members of the Catholic Church and other Christian churches, all men and women of the Judeo‐Christian heritage, as well as all people of good will who unite in common dedication for the defense of life in its fullness and for the promotion of all human rights. Our celebration of life forms part of the celebration of the Eucharist. Our Lord and Savior, through his death and Resurrection, has become for us the bread of life and the pledge of eternal life. In him we find the courage, perseverance and inventiveness which we need in order to promote and defend life within our families and throughout the world. Dear brothers and sisters: We are confident that Mary, the mother of God and the mother of life, will give us her help so that our way of living will always reflect our admiration and gratitude for God's gift of love that is life. Rendering Life More Human We know that she, mother of God and mother of life, will help us to use every day that is given to us as an opportunity to defend the life of the unborn and to render more human the lives of all our fellow human beings, wherever they may be. And through the intercession of Our Lady of the Rosary, whose feast we celebrate today, may we come one day to the fullness of eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. Amen."
New Challenge for U.S. Catholics,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/09/archives/new-challenge-for-us-catholics-papal-journey-an-analysis-popes-us.html,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 8 — During his stunning seven‐day visit to the United States, Pope John Paul II attracted new interest in Christian faith and human rights but, as he left, it was uncertain in what ways his pastoral call would benefit the Roman Catholic Church in America. In 69 speeches and sermons, the Pope set down a program for the church and anagenda for his papacy. He delivered a message of many parts, and it lifted the spirits of some Americans and discouraged others. When he arrived in Rome this morning, the Pope told a welcoming delegation that the visit had filled his spirit “with gratitude, joy and emotion.” [Page B8.] “It's been a morale‐booster for American Catholics,” said Msgr. Edward O'Donnell, editor of The St. Louis Review, the city's Catholic newspaper. There was a widespread feeling that the Pope's personal warmth and persuasiveness could help overcome many divisions within the church. “Even if he had some harsh words for some groups, it was overlaid with a warmth and pastoral affection that softened it,” said Msgr. Noel C. Burtenshaw of Atlanta. Debate has already begun over the Pope's decision to set such a firm course so early in his papacy. But there is little doubt that he is a man who knows what he wants and had a definite set of objectives in to this country. His principal aims were to challenge the world to pursue the goal of social justice and to outline the church's positions on doctrine in the clearest possible way. At least two groups of Americans have shown that they have responded enthusiastically to his message. First, there are those who drew inspiration from the Pope's call for a commitment to Christ as an antidote to what John Paul sees as Western moral and spiritual decadence. Various accounts testify to the Pope's ability to induce spiritual reflection among a broad spectrum of Americans, including those who never set foot in church. Second, there are the many people in whom the Pope's pleas for human rights and relief for the poor, summed up in his address to the United Nations, have revived idealism. Among those people are agnostics and atheists who otherwise pay little attention to the church. The Pope acted as a catalyst for the cause of human justice. Problematical for Church Despite the fact that the Pope has swayed large segments of the public, however, his influence on the future of the church as an institution in this country remains problematical. Many Catholics felt disheartened by the Pope's reaffirmation of traditional teachings on sexuality, his stand against women in the priesthood and his strong advocacy of celibacy for priests and nuns. “I don't think there's any surprise in what he said,” the Rev. George Crespin, chancellor of the Diocese of Oakland, Calif., remarked. “We were all prepared for the fact that he would re‐emphasize celibacy in the priesthood.” Still, some Catholics were dismayed at his apparent foreclosure of reconsideration of these stands. Surveys in recent years show that the church's opposition to artificial birth control, divorce and abortion has been rejected by growing numbers of Catholics and accounts for the major share of the church's sharp losses over the last decade. Playing Down Official Stands Many priests and some bishops have tried to play down the official stands in recent years in an effort to keep Catholics in the church and to attract new members. But the Pope, in giving these issues heightened prominence, has linked them to fidelity to the church, the concern he repeated over and over during his tour. On a broad scale, then, the Pope's ability to arouse spiritual interest might benefit other Christian churches, churches with more liberal views, more than it benefits Catholicism. While the Pope may have helped to renew Christianity's appeal, the Catholic Church itself may be seen as an untenable option because of its stands on social and moral issues. These pressures also pose a dilemma for the swelling numbers of Catholics who identify with the church while dissenting from its teachings on such matters as contraception and divorce. Though the American church has not approved this shift in attitudes, there has been greater sensitivity on every level of the church to the causes of dissent. By linking loyalty to Catholicism withconformity to traamonat teaciungs, tne Pope has raised the challenge to these dissenting Catholics, and some believe that it will cause an increase in attrition. “I expect that in the next years we'll see the further demise of the papacy,” said a priest who was referring to the drop in confidence in the hierarchy shown in recent polls. “It's the same old thing all over again — instead of trying to see that God may be asking us to do something new.” On the other hand, Catholic conservatives believe that a hard line on ethical, moral and theological matters, as set forth by the Pope, is exactly the right stance. They say that he has cleared the air and portrayed the church, quite correctly, in their view, as disciplined and clear‐minded. Such a church, they contend, will appeal to many who are searching for religious and moral certainty. Since the Second Vatican Council, the traditionalist element of the church has often complained that its concerns were neglected or slighted by a church undergoing rapid change. Many have joined the traditionalist movements that have retained most features of the pre‐Vatican Council church, including the Tridentine Latin mass. The Pope's statements on doctrine in the last week encourage those traditionalists to move closer to the mainstream of the church. The effectiveness of the rebellious traditionalist movements also appears to have been seriously undercut. ‘A Sense of What Matters’ “There has been so much confusion in recent years that people don't know what matters,” said Sharon Yates, a government employee in Washington. “The Pope gives them a sense of what matters.” With fresh support from the Pope, the conservatives, including the majority of the American bishops, appear to have strengthened their position. But they will also be faced by the Pope's call for greater efforts for social justice, a cause that conservatives have given relatively little attention. In Ireland, the Pope signaled that the period of experimentation in the church is over, and in the United States he enumerated the principles of consolidation. While the Pope's sincerity is not seriously questioned, there are differences over whether the definition he has given to the church's central mission will widen or narrow the divisions in the church. The most complete perspective of the Pope's vision came in his sermon in Chicago. There he repeated his plea for unity, asserted that the “content of faith must be neither impaired nor mutilated” and called for more aid to the poor. He also touched upon the need for more exchange of views within the church. Catholics differ over whether the Pope understood the diversity of the American church and how prepared he is to listen to views that oppose his own. In Chicago, the Pope acknowledged these conflicts and offered one remedy. “Let love then build the bridges across our differences,” he said, “and at times our contrasting positions. Let love for each other and love for truth be the answer to polarization.”"
"Pope's Spirit Filled With ‘Gratitude, Joy and Emotion’",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/09/archives/popes-spirit-filled-with-gratitude-joy-and-emotion-asleep-during.html,"ROME, Oct. 8 — Pope John Paul II, his eyes puffed and his face reddened with fatigue, stepped from the airliner Shepherd One in midmorning here today and Special to The New York Timestold a welcoming delegation that “the indelible emotions of more than a week of liturgical celebrations and encouners” had filled his spirit “with gratitude, joy and emotion.” And to about 5,000 people in St. Peter's Square, he said: “Thanks, a thousand thanks. You have come to see if the Pope has come home; well, he has come home.” But he was not to stay at the Vatican long. A short time after his brief, traditional appearance at the balcony window overlooking the square, the Vatican announced that he was on his way to Castel Gandolfo, his summer residence in the mountains some 20 miles to the southeast, for two days of rest. Asleep During Flight The signs of fatigue, held in abeyance during the long days and many appearances of his triumphal visit to Ireland and the United States, could not be suppressed, once he was airborne. The Pontiff dined in the private cabin that had been fixed up for him in the upstairs lounge of the 747 jetliner, then slept until the big plane started its descent on Rome, members of his entourage said. meeting with correspondents on the plane was canceled. At the airport, as the Pope read a brief statement in Italian, he rubbed tired eyes occasionally. And his remarks to the crowd in St. Peter's Square, made afterlong minutes spent in prayer in St. Peter's Basilica, were short. “I will tell you all about the trip later,” he said, then gave the crowd his blessing. He had flown from the airport to the Vatican by helicopter. The Vatican obviously considered the Pope's visit a huge success. Today's L'Osservatore Romano, the official Vatican newspaper, devoted seven of its eight pages to a report on the Pontiff's last two days in Washington. On the front page was a large picture of the Pope waving to the crowds on the Mall yesterday, with the Capitol in the background. Most of the space was devoted to the text of the Pope's speeches in the languages he used — English and Spanish. In addition there was an eight‐page pullout section with more pictures and the texts of the same speeches and homilies in Italian. This has been the paper's layout every day since the Pope left Rome on Sept. 29. In its dispatches and commentaries, L'Osservatore Romano has stressed the immensity of the crowds, the Pope's electrifying impact on young people and the attention he received from non‐Catholics among other aspects of the trip. The trip “will be remembered as a triumph of human hope,” the newspaper wrote. A commentator on Vatican Radio said that John Paul “has shown authentic signs of a strong Pope” and added, with reference to the Pope's call for greater observance of church doctrine, “He is not afraid to speak the truth.” “He has emerged as a guiding force who will carry us into the third milienium,” another commentator on Vatican Radio said. There is a strong awareness in Catholic circles here that the Pope is using his compelling personality and his dramatic gifts as a preacher to drive home stern messages on controversial issues such as discipline within the clergy, abortion, divorce and artificial contraception.

Two Fund Bills Voted by House To End Impasse,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/10/archives/two-fund-bills-voted-by-house-to-end-impasse-bid-for-peace-with.html,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 9 — Seeking to break a deadlock with the Senate, the House passed separate appropriations bills today, one including strict limitations on abortions, the other providing a 5.5 percent raise for members of Congress and for top Federal officials. The carefully devised strategy was designed to isolate the emotional abortion issue and thus clear the way for quick action on providing funds for Federal departments and agencies that are facing fiscal hardship. But it was uncertain tonight whether the Senate would go along with the House. The Senate Appropriations Committee will meet tomorrow to discuss the matter. Tangled Web of Issues Seldom in recent years have the Senate and House found themselves caught up in such a tangled web. Involved are such seemingly unrelated issues as guidelines on the use of Federal funds for abortions and money to operate the Government and pay increases to members of Congress and top Federal officials. The Senate and House have been deadlocked for weeks over these issues in a crucial continuing appropriations bill: ¶The House insists on a 5.5 percent pay increase for members of Congress and top Federal officials; the Senate has twice rejected such an increase for members of Congress. ¶The House wants to limit Federal 1 funds for abortions to cases in which the mother's life is endangered; the Senate has twice insisted on more liberal language allowing abortions in cases of incest and rape and when prolonged physical damage can be incurred by the mother, as determined by two physicians. First Day After Recess Caught up in this impasse has been the continuing appropriations bill to allow Federal agencies whose own money bills have not yet cleared Congress to continue spending at last year's levels in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. Today, on its first day back from a 10day recess, the House moved swiftly in hopes of breaking the impasse. Passed by voice vote were two bills: The first would allow Federal departments to spend at last year's levels until Nov. 20, or until regular appropriations bills had cleared Congress. To this bill, the House attached a 5.5 percent raise for members of Congress and top Federal officals. The second bill, to allow the Department of Labor and the Department of Health, Education and Welfare to spend at last year's levels, includes the House's strict guidelines on money for abortions. Substitution is Defeated An effort by Representative Norman D. Dicks, Democrat of Washington, to substitue the Senate's more liberal language on abortion was defeated, 234 to 162. This 72‐vote margin was even larger than the 61‐vote margin by which the House defeated a similar move some weeks ago. This would seem to indicate that the Senate‐House deadlock over abortion will not be resolved any time soon, thus leaving the Federal departments and agencies facing a severe fiscal situation. “If we continue to deadlock over this issue of abortion, and if Social Security checks don't go out on time, we may find ourselves back here some night, trying to straighten all this out,” Representative Robert Duncan, Democrat of Oregon, told his colleagues. Meanwhile, another set of House and Senate conferees today opened what is expected to be a fierce battle over the Federal budget for the fiscal year 1980. The lawmakers, who have already failed to produce a budget ceiling in time for the start of the fiscal year, met for several minutes and then adjourned until tomorrow.

Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/10/archives/letters-thoughts-on-the-visit-of-pope-john-paul-ii-rash-us-cheers.html,"To the Editor: The Pope's visit to this country was extremely well received, a fitting response to a world leader who is, at the same time, a charming man with a magnetic personality. Strangely enough, however, there was remarkably little criticism in the press concerning the precepts of the Catholic hierarchy with regard to abortion and contraception. Those precepts, if followed, would make the population explosion even worse than it now is. Since about one pregnancy in three is terminated by abortion, without abortion world population would grow about 120 million each year, rather than the actual increase of around 80 million. There is a growing consensus that further population growth in an already vastly overpopulated world threatens to destroy — for centuries to come, if not forever — man's ancient dream of a good life for all, free from material want. But should the Roman Catholic Church be singled out for criticism for failure to recognize the critical nature of the problem of overpopulation, and the urgent need to find a solution to it? On the world stage, is the record of any of the other major religions substantially better? In this country, what Protestant denomination advocates measures of real population control, i.e., the planned and conscious regulation by society of total population size? And, religion apart, there are many sectors of our society whose business it is to promote the public good — for example, the media, our political parties and their leaders, the environmental organizations, the scientific and academic communities and the leaders of business and labor. More and more informed individuals believe that the central issue of our time is how to halt and then reverse population growth so that population size can eventually be stabilized at some fraction of today's numbers. How can we explain the fact that not one of the above‐named groups or organizations has recognized and focused on that issue? It is particularly baffling that the environmental organizations have not long ago acknowledged the utter futility of trying to halt and reverse the degradation of our environment unless population growth is also halted and reversed. It is undoubtedly true that the Catholic Church is open to severe criticism for its continued evasion of the most critical issue facing humanity in its entire history — how to halt and reverse population growth. It is only fair to point out, however, that the issue is also being evaded by almost every other significant group or sector of our society. DONALD MANN Pres., Negative Population Growth New York, Oct. 5,1979 To the Editor: The visits of Pope John Paul II to the Yankee Stadium and Shea Stadium were inspiring and refreshing. He's the only winner we've had at those ball Darks all year. TIMOTHY SHEA Oyster Bay, L.I., Oct. 4,1979 To the Editor: It was with great respect that New York City welcomed the Pope. He spoke of love and human dignity and peace. Before the United Nations he mentioned the Middle East and how important it was to settle the Palestinian problem. It would have been an act of courage if the Pope had just asked the oil‐rich Arab nations to settle the Arab refugees among themselves, as Israel did with its Jewish refugees from Arab lands. There would not be a Palestinian problem if the Arabs had not kept their own brothers in refugee camps for 30 years. Alas, the Pope did not ask the oilrich Arab countries to alleviate the misery of their own brothers once and for all. Alas, the Vatican did not grant recognition to Israel and its people. We can only hope that this Pope will change the Vatican's historical attitude toward Israel and thus influence the world, including the Middle East, toward a permanent neace for all. RUTH NUSSBACHER New York, Oct. 3, 1979 To the Editor: The concern everyone in this city feels for its financial plight logically leads one to wonder who will be paying the substantial bill with which the Pope's visit has burdened us. The U.N. which is his host, the U.S. Government which is its host, the Catholic Church — all of whom can afford it — or the city which cannot? JOHN R. MCGINLEY JR. New York, Oct. 3,1979 To the Editor: I am a television operator for the United Nations. I am also Jewish. Yesterday, UNTV covered Pope John Paul's visit to the U.N., and I was in the fortunate position of having the close‐up shot of the Pope during his address to the General Assembly. It was a very impressive experience. What was even more memorable to me was the Pope's return to the General Assembly later, to address the U.N. staff alone. His talk was brief butaffectionate and was received with great enthusiasm. He left amid much applause but later returned and gave his blessing to the staff. All of us at UNTV, coming from a variety of backgrounds, felt privileged to have been an integral part of the worldwide broadcast of this event and to have been so close to the Pontiff himself. KAREN HELLER New York, Oct. 3, 1979 Rash U.S. Cheers for Soviet Defectors To the Editor: May I inject some common sense and charity — into the widespread American glee over the recent defection of prominent Soviet citizens? In the first place (since good manners require that we put ourselves into the place of others), how would we feel if some of our most visible fellow citizens defected to the Soviet Union and many lesser ones envied their good luck? How would American democracy fare against widespread apathy, disloyalty or downright hostility selfrighteously cheered from without? If we aim to promote a more humane government in the Soviet Union, does it make sense to accentuate the insecurity of the Soviet state at the price of escalating the nuclear arms race and focusing on the danger of a nuclear confrontation? By rejoicing over defectors, the American people, without realizing it, wage a ruthless political offensive against the Soviet system, taking the fullest advantage of their largely accidental assets in all comparisons between their country and the Soviet Union. They force the Soviet Government ever more to substitute armaments and repression for the social and political cohesion which history has denied that country. (Let us never forget in the facile comparisons of power attendant upon SALT II that the Soviet Government, like the czars, had little choice but to replace the missing popular loyalty with military mightwhich makes unrealistic and lopsided any assessment of strength merely built around weapons.) And let no one argue that consideration for the internal needs of the Soviet state is a betrayal of Russian dissenters. They surely deserve our compassion for their heroism, but hardly for their rudimentary sense of political reality in their own country and the world at large. Like most of their prerevolutionary predecessors, they have shown remarkably little comprehension of the power foundations of modern democracy, political freedom or humane culture. Does it make sense to escalate for their sake the political and military tensions that may wipe out millions in both countries (includin2 the dissenters)? THEODORE H. VON LAUE Professor of History, Clark University Worcester, Mass., Sept. 28, 1979 Not‐So‐Wise Men To the Editor: What an astonishing group of elder statesmen Jimmy Carter assembled to advise him on the Soviet brigade in Cuba: Rusk, McCone, Gilpatric, Ball, Clifford, Schlesinger — a ghostly curtain call for the arrogance, misjudgment and blindness that cost 50,000 lives in Vietnam. Was the White House being satirical when it labeled this alumni reunion “The Wise Men”? JAMES M. COLE Parlin, N.J., Sept. 30, 1979 Problems Beyond Conrail's Ability To the Editor: Conrail's full‐page ad in the Oct. 4 Times is a slap in the face for the thousands of commuters who struggle daily with the outrageous conditions on the New York commuter lines. The ad says, “Conrail's performance to date demonstrates that it can manage the railroad and deal with problems within its control.” Conrail management seems to have forgotten that part of its job is to run the commuter lines as well as the freight lines. The $2.3 billion of taxpayer money that has gone into Conrail (which will never in our lifetime be repaid) is supposed to be used in part to help the commuter system. I invite the president and top management of Conrail to join with commuters any morning or evening, as I have, and to let them judge how well • their system runs. Recently, I investigated Conrail maintenance as it pertains to the Hudson and Harlem Divisions. I found absolutely no program of preventive maintenance and an overall situation that at any given time keeps 20 to 90 commuter cars out of service. I hope that the investigation by the United States Railway Association now under way, conducted at my request, will give me and other members of Congress the ammunition to go after this inept, poorly run system. PETER A. PEYSER Member of Congress, 23d Dist., N.Y. Washington, Oct. 4, 1979 The High Cost of Keeping America's Merchant Marine Afloat To the Editor: Mr. Roth failed to distinguish between the liner trades, where American‐flag vessels transport almost onethird of U.S. import and export cargoes, and the international bulk trades, where they have never truly been competitive. The basic difference between the two is that the conference system of fixed rates, prevalent in the former, enables the high‐cost U.S.‐flag operator to capture a share of the market; the free‐market system in the bulk trades generally excludes him. I also find it difficult to accept Mr. Roth's argument that the “old bugaboo of high labor costs is gradually evaporating as the gap between American and foreign pay scales narrows, to a point, for example, where a German mate earns close to 50,000 marks annually.” I believe Mr. Roth will find, upon closer examination, that the gap has widened in recent years. While he is essentially correct in pointing out the annual earnings of a German chief mate (who would also earn 90 days’ vacation pay or working a full year), Mr. Roth misses the mark when he cites the relatively high‐cost German deck officer, paid with one of the world's strongest currencies, as representative of the competition, at least in the international bulk trades. German‐flag vessels are today virtually noncompetitive in the bulk trades, a situation which first became critical during the mid‐1960's and which caused German owners to engage in “outflagging.” By placing their vessels under the open registries of Liberia and Panama to remain competitive, the German owners emulated the approach of American shipowners two decades earlier. While the annual earnings of a German deck officer are irrelevant to the competitive status of U.S.‐flag vessels, they do emphasize the severity of the problem of U.S. payroll costs vis-á vis costs of foreign seafarers. Consider that an American chief mate who works a full year on a U.S.‐flag vessel would earn roughly $69,000 (about 108,800 marks) and be entitled to about 280 days of paid vacation. Today, it costs an average of about $37,000 per year per shipboard billet to subsidize higher payroll costs of U.S.flag crews over the costs of foreign crews. Mr. Roth seems to believe that “the higher labor expense will be more than made up by improvements in safety and maintenance records over those on American‐owned vessels operating under flags of convenience.” His cost/benefit argument is questionable: A 1977 study by the highly respected Tanker Advisory Center showed that American‐controlled Liberian and Panamanian tankers, ore/ oil vessels and bulk/oil carrier “have a significantly better casualty record” than U.S.‐flag tankers.

A Tough New Drive On Births in China,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/10/archives/a-tough-new-drive-on-births-in-china-a-tough-new-drive-on-births-in.html,"USING a variety of contraceptives, including “vacation pills” for couples who are rarely united and “paper pills” prepared in perforated sheets like postage stamps, China is making an all‐out effort to stem its population growth. The initial goal is to reduce the annual growth rate to 1 percent by next year. In 1954, according to official figures, it reached a peak of 2.34 percent. From interviews with medical workers, pharmaceutical researchers and ordinary citizens it is evident that an extensive educational campaign is under way, using radio, television, newspapers, commune reading rooms and exhortative songs at concerts in the cities. Economic incentives are being used, and next March they will become stronger when the salaries of those who have a third child will be reduced 10 percent until that child reaches the age of 14. The child will also be denied free education and medical care. While intrauterine devices were the recommended and most widely used methods at a commune visited last month near Shanghai, virtually all techniques are used. In some communes and urban communities oral contraceptives appear to predominate. It was not long ago that folk remedies against conception were prevalent. According to one formulation, “Fresh tadpoles coming out in the spring should be washed clean in cold boiled water and swallowed whole three or four days after menstruation.” “If a woman swallows 14 live tadpoles on the first day and 10 more the following day, she will not conceive for five years,” the prescription said. As recently as 1964, as pointed out by Dr. Carl Djerassi of Stanford University in his forthcoming book, “The Politics of Contraception,” reference was made to the tadpole method in an otherwise sophisticated Chinese review of contraceptive techniques. Seven years earlier, however, the method had been tested on 65 women. Each swallowed 44 tadpoles and 43 percent became pregnant. Dr. Djerassi was largely responsible for discovery of Norlutin, the first of the female oral contraceptives, which is widely used in China as “pill No. 1.” While various contraceptive preparations are taken by millions of Chinese women, only 10,000 men are taking the birth‐control substance gossypol experimentally. All the contraceptives appear to be made in China. One difficulty in assessing the birthcontrol effort is learning how effective it is in remote rural areas where a large percentage of Chinese live. The newly enacted economic incentives, however, clearly indicate the Government's determination to halt population growth in order to improve living standards. In interviews, birth‐control and public health officials of Guangdong Province, of which this city is the capital, said nursery costs and charges for school supplies through senior middle school (comparable to high school in the United States) are waived for couples who have produced only one child and have pledged not to have another. Women cannot register for marriage, they said, until age 23. The minimum age for men is 26 in urban areas and 25 in rural areas. Such rules, they said, vary slightly from one province to another and do not apply to autonomous regions for ethnic minorities. Despite the effort to curb birth rates, they added, medical help is still given those who have difficulty bearing children. In cities, according to a recent Guangdong provincial broadcast, housing priority will be given those with no more than two children and those who marry late. Couples with one child will be given apartments for four‐member families. There is to be job preference for children of families with a single son or two daughters if the children are suitable for employment. Presumably the distinction is to allow for those who try a second time to have a son, a traditional goal in this society. The children of such small city families “need not be sent down to rural areas,” according to the broadcast. If they have already been dispatched to farms they will be granted preference in returning. Such incentives, which appear to apply nationwide, were described to American science writers visiting the July First commune near Shanghai. The visitors were told of the salary reduction for large families that will take effect next March and the allocation of additional private garden plots to those with small families. A couple with one child is given a plot allocation for a four‐member family and a small salary bonus. Those who at retirement have had no children receive additional pension benefits. This is meant to compensate for the traditional desire to produce a son who could support parents in their later years. The chairman of the women's committee of the commune, Xie Gundi, is forceful 34‐year‐old woman whose tasks include lecturing women of the commune on family planning and seeing to it that they comply. The July First commune (named for the birthday of the Chinese Communist Party) is primarily an agricultural community of 5,018 households and 19,004 people. They are divided into 11 production brigades and 88 production teams. Most cultivate rice, wheat, cotton, vegetables, pigs, poultry (including eggs) and mushrooms. The surplus produce is marketed in Shanghai. There are also shops assembling electric engines for irrigation pumps, furniture, boats and farm implements as well as home production of knitted and bamboo goods. After a woman bears her first child, Mrs. Xie or one of the commune's medical workers tells her the choices of contraceptive methods, recommending an intrauterine device. The woman is told that according to the rules she may have only one more child, after four years have elapsed. Where preventive measures, fail abortions are available. This year, as of August, the commune's 2,978 women of child‐bearing age had borne 120 children and there had been 50 abortions. Of the more than 3,000 married couples, 190 had elected sterilization to prevent further births. In 95 percent of these cases it was the woman who was sterilized. By 1970 a number of Chinese women were using monthly Injections of a steroid that reportedly can cause irregular menstrual bleeding. According to Mrs. Xie, some at the commune use the injections. A small percentage of couples use a diaphragm, condoms or the rhythm method, which she termed unreliable. The paper pill, she added, not used at all. That pill is marketed in sheets of various colors, which indicate the contraceptive preparation with which the paper is treated. Like the wrappings of some Chinese and Japanese confections, the paper is digestible. Each perforated sheet contains 22 stamps for the 22 days of the monthly cycle on which they are to be eaten. The vacation pill on which the most information is available contains derivative of the steroid hormone anordrin synthesized by the Institute of Organic Chemistry in Shanghai. It is taken immediately after intercourse and again the next morning, the procedure being repeated throughout the brief vacation. In this way the woman is not subjected during the rest of the year to the side effects of steroid hormones in the standard pills, notably occasional effects on the circulatory system, such as blood clots. Anordrin, the compound from which this pill was derived, was discovered by a French chemist 20 years ago. It was rejected in the United States as a contraceptive because it prolongs the menstrual cycle and sometimes causes vomiting, dizziness and other complaints. The Chinese apparently consider it acceptable for limited periods. It was introduced into general use in 1974. Clinical trials have been under way since last year on a new “morningafter” contraceptive developed at the Shanghai institute. It is a form of norgestrienone believed to prevent implantation of an embryo in the uterus. The drug is related to some under study in West Germany and elsewhere. It can also be used to induce early abortion. For more advanced pregnancies trichosanthine is being used. This is derived from the extract of a gourd root that as early as the 15th century in China was inserted into the vagina to induce discharge of fetal membranes. According to a professor at the Shanghai institute, two milligrams of purified trichosanthine injected as late as the fifth month of pregnancy will lead to labor and abortion within a week. It is coming into general use in areas where medical facilities are limited."

U.S. Pay Is Threatened by Impasse,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/11/archives/us-pay-is-threatened-by-impasse.html,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 10 — A SenateHouse impasse that threatens payless or reduced‐rate paydays for millions in the military and in Federal agencies intensified today as the Senate held firm against a Congressional pay increase and strict limits on Federal funds for abortions. The Senate, refusing to accept two House money bills separately providing for the raise and for the abortion limits, passed a single money bill containing no pay increase and a more liberal abortion policy. The vote was 81 to 15. Senate and House negotiators promptly scheduled a new round of bargining for tomorrow in an effort to reach an agreement and forestall a potentially serious Government crisis. Already a few Federal employees, including some at the Department of Labor, have been issued checks covering only work done in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. The pay period extended into the new fiscal year that began Oct. 1, after which, because of the spending impasse, no spending has been authorized. Benefit checks have been withheld from about 2,000 people newly enrolled in the black lung disease program, and 44,000 more might not receive their black lung benefit checks next Monday. The money crunch arises because the provisions on abortion and a Congressional pay increase were appended to proposed legislation that would permit most Federal departments and agencies to continue spending at last fiscal year's levels until their regular appropriations bills clear Congress. It is to this otherwise routine legislation that the Senate and House attached their own views on a Congressional raise and use of money for abortions. The continuing appropriations legislation would provide temporary spending levels for such major departments as Agriculture, Defense, Interior, Labor, Transportation and Health, Education and Welfare, as well as for foreign aid, postal operations and military construction programs, the District of Columbia, and the Congress itself. Three times in recent weeks the House has a approved a 5.5 percent Congressional raise and has insisted on limiting Federal funds for abortions to cases in which a mother's life is endangered. Today marked the third time, too, that the Senate has rejected a Congressional pay increase and insisted on a more liberal abortion policy to include cases of rape and incest and instances where prolonged physical damage would be in, curred by the mother. Meanwhile, Government departments braced for a money emergency. About 85,000 employees of the Department of Agriculture may receive only half pay in their checks Friday. The Department of Defense has already prepared two sets of checks for about 600,000 employees whose payday is also Friday. One set is for the full twoweek pay period; the other is for only the final work week in the last fiscal year. On Monday, some 1,600,000 military personnel, 111,000 employees of the Department of Transportation and 22,300 employees of the Department of Labor may also receive only half pay. There also could be half pay on Tuesday for 198,000 employees of the Veterans Administration, 144,000 employees of H.E.W., 10,700 employees of the Environmental Protection Agency and 5,800 employees of the Agency for International Development. Half‐pay checks might be issued Wednesday to 16,100 employees of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and 54,000 employees of the Department of Interior."
"Books: Rosie,’ a Death",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/12/archives/books-rosie-a-death-after-an-illegal-abortion.html,"ROSAURA JIMENEZ died in pain Oct. 3, 1977, in McAllen, Tex., at the age of 27, leaving behind her a 5‐year‐old daughter and an uncashed scholarship check. Hers was the first recorded death by illegal abortion after a cutback in Federal Medicaid funds for abortions. Informed of the event by Frances Kissling, then executive director of the National Abortion Federation, Ellen Frankfort, the feminist writer, traveled south to McAllen to look into that death. “Rosie: The Investigation of a Wrongful Death” is the result of her research, an absorbing, poignant and sometimes maddening reconstruction of a life. Slowly, interview by interview, conversation by conversation, Miss Frankfort pieces together the circumstances that drove Miss Jimenez to seek the abortion. She discovers that, contrary to early reports, Miss Jimenez had not crossed the border to have the abortion in Mexico because she was ashamed of her open sexuality, but had gone to a filthy, local woman who still operated illegally in McAllen. She discovers that, having had a previous abortion through Medicaid, Miss Jimenez had, in fact, been driven by poverty to seek the illegal operation. And she discovers an extraordinary assortment of people who knew the woman, and some who cared enough about her to risk their lives and reputations for the sake of “Rosie.” Miss Frankfort has recreated the people in Miss Jimenez's life with color and care. Hers is an intriguing picture of an investigative reporter at work, and the investigation itself has its exciting moments. She does not hide her strong commitment to the cause of abortion rights. Five percent of the book's royalties are to be contributed to the Rosie Jimenez Fund, which provides financial assistance to the poor seeking abortions in Texas. She hits out at the hypocrisy of both “pro‐” and “anti‐choice” camps in the abortionrights conflict, and her Rosie is a slovenly enough saint. But that commitment does lead Miss Frankfort to some maddening excesses. It is evident from her contorted early descriptions of McAllen that the author is prepared from the start to see the worst in the community. Her rhetoric becomes a little heavy‐handed at times. Characterizations of Dr. Homero Rivas, Miss Jimenez's former physician, a pair of repressed nuns and an insensitive team of Federal investigators are overdrawn, lacking the stunning simplicity of the passages in which Miss Frankfort comes on Miss Jimenez's deserted apartment and meagerly decorated grave. And yet, and yet. “Look at it this way,” a woman says in an attempt to comfort a grieving friend. “With so many investigations, it's like she's not really dead. Rosie's going national.” It has the homely ring of truth. JENNIFER DUNNING ROSIE: The Investigation of a Wrongful Death. By Ellen Frankfort, with Frances Kissling. 173 pages. Dial. $8.95."
A Peking Scene: Pimps and Prostitutes at the Peace Cafe,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/12/archives/a-peking-scene-pimps-and-prostitutes-at-the-peace-cafe-a.html,"PEKING, Oct. 11 — Several young men in army uniforms are sitting around a large new Japanese cassette tape recorder, transfixed by the beat of a pop love song. Stacks of other cassettes, adorned with pictures of pretty Hong Kong recording stars, are spread on the table in front of them. At another table a young woman with lipstick and teased hair and wearing a tight blue sweater jumps up and embraces a tall man in his early 29's who has sauntered in. He is wearing a Western jacket with high padded shoulders, oversized lapels and bell‐bottom trousers, a Chinese zoot suit. “Hey, do I look Chinese?” he asks foreigner, grinning with the satisfaction of someone who has just broken the most stringent conventions of his society. “If you'd like,” he confides, “you can have this real cute xiao meimei,” or girl. She smiles in assent. He is, it transpires, her pimp. A Puritanical Pride Even more than the music, her makeup and their clothes, his suggestion is startling. The Chinese Communists have long prided themselves in having eradicated the prostitution that flourished in China before 1949. Under the Communists’ puritanical moral code, even premarital sex is not supposed to occur and couples may not marry until they are at least 25. The scene for all this improbable activity is the Peace Cafe, a hangout for Peking's trendy young set down a narrow dimly lighted street named Goldfish Alley. In American terms, it is somewhere between the innocent old neighborhood drugstore of the 1950's and an unsavory Eighth Avenue bar. Some of the customers, mostly factory workers, soldiers, unemployed high school graduates, and children of high‐ranking officials, go only to drink beer, to indulge in chocolate sundaes and to see and be seen. Others are there to make assignations. Unlike the dissidents who paste up posters on Peking's Democracy Wall, they are not given to highbrow conversation about human rights. But the young people who patronize the Peace Cafe also pose a challenge to the Government, a test of how far liberalization can go. A Travesty of Maoism In many ways they seem to deliberately stand Maoist ideals on their head, to parody the pantheon of Communist virtues. They might be called China's counterculture, for they are really a reaction to all the years of stifling restrictions on personal and cultural life. They also represent part of the new sense of rising expectations that is sweeping China's cities, along with a yearning among some for Western ways. It would be wrong to exaggerate the number of people who come to the Peace Cafe. They are a tiny minority. But they appear to be a sign of something deeper. Take the man in the zoot suit, Wang Guanghua — literally, Wang Glory to China. Mr. Wang, who says his father is a general, graduated froni high school two years ago but has not yet been assigned a job, a common plight. “When I was a boy I was very bad,” he says. “You know what I liked to do, fight,” and he cracks his fists together. “Not one against one, but gang fights, every day. I was the best.” His nose, broken and misshapen, lends plausibility to his boast. ‘A Terrible Student’ “I was a terrible student,” he continued. “I studied Russian, but I only learned how to write one letter, R. But then I did not learn many Chinese characters either.” Chinese normally take great pride in education. One of Mr. Wang's young women is a square, solidly built woman whose faded gray jacket and baggy pants match her daytime job in Peking's Capital Iron and Steel Plant. But at night she puts on lipstick, still a daring act in China, and somehow manages to comb her hair in an alluring style popular in Hong Kong, with long bangs over her eyes. To a foreigner that may not make much of a difference in her overall appearance. But in China nuance can be everything. And for those Chinese who are interested, that, plus the cigarette she smokes, is a tipoff. Almost no young women smoke in public in China. Another woman, a nurse, who earns the equivalent of $15 a month from her job, talked about how she became a part‐time prostitute. “I started making love in middle school, when I was 17,” she related. “It wasn't so hard, you just go to a friend's house when the parents are both out at work.” In a hard voice, with her hands planted on her hips, she said her worst problem is that her own parents demand she be home by 9 each night. Like most Chinese into their 30's, she still lives at home because of a severe housing shortage. To fool her parents, she said, “I tell them I'm going over to a friend's house.” ‘Back‐Door’ Abortions As a precaution against becoming pregnant, she takes birth control pills, dispensed free in all drug stores as part of China's population‐control program. “When one of the girls gets pregnant, they can use the back door to get an abortion,” she added. The back door is Chinese slang for unofficial ways of getting things done by contacts or payoffs. She doesn't think the Peace Cafe is anything special: “It's very boring; everything in Peking is boring.” With all this illicit activity, the Peace Cafe might seem an obvious target for a police crackdown. Indeed, the risk is magnified by the number of young men and women who hang around in the evenings outside the cafe's old Chinesestyle red doors guarded by two small stone lions. But a heavyset man whose face was flushed red with beer said there was no reason to worry. “The police won't do anything unless there is a fight or someone throws their food,” he said. Once the Public Security Bureau took away his bicycle, which had parked illegally outside — the equivalent of having your car towed in New York. But he soon got it back, he boasted. “My father is a high official in the Public Security Ministry, and if they hit me, I've got the power to hit them back.” Associated Press Chinese youngsters drinking in a Peking cafe"
Pay Issue Snags Key Money Bill,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/12/archives/pay-issue-snags-key-money-bill-magnuson-stands-firm.html,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 11 — Senate and House negotiators failed to reach agreement tonight on a crucial money bill that has been caught up in a bitter stalemate over abortion and a Congressional pay increase. Another round of bargaining will be held tomorrow, but even if a compromise is reached it will be too late for thousands of Federal employees whose paychecks have been held up because of a lack of funds. Earlier today, House conferees had tentatively agreed to a more liberal policy on abortion than the House had voted. In turn, there were indications that the Senate might give in to the House by agreeing to a 5.5 percent raise for members of Congress. Magnuson Stands Firm Several House conferees had already signed a conference agreement when the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Warren G. Magnuson, Democrat of Washington, said his conferees could not back down on the Congressional pay issue. Stunned House conferees went into huddle and emerged to inform the Senate group that the House probably would not be at all eager to change its stand on the abortion issue after all. The stalled legislation, of which the abortion and Congressional raise issues are a part, seeks to allow Federal departments and agencies whose regular appropriations bills have not yet cleared Congress to continue spending temporarily at levels of the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. As part of the bill, the House has voted three times for a 5.5 percent pay increase. The Senate has rejected any pay increase. The House legislation would limit Federal funds for abortions to those cases in which another's life would be endangered. The Senate version would allow abortions in cases of rape and incest and when a mother's health would be impaired, as determined by two physicians."
Letters The Fed's Road to Depression,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/13/archives/letters-the-feds-road-to-depression-landmarks-on-the-upper-east.html,"To the Editor: The Federal Reserve Board's dramatic move to tighten the money supply and raise interest rates is nothing more than a continuation of the policy it has been following since December of 1968. The board's chairman has changed. So has the Administration. But not the policy. Initially, it was intended to stop a 4 per cent inflation. Now it seeks to halt a 12 per cent rise in the cost of living. This policy has failed for the past 11 years and will continue to fait, because tinkering with the money supply (fine tuning) cannot cure the chronic condition that created the disease. The causes of our troubles are our growing deficits, internal and external. A nation that keeps printing money and facing adverse balances of trade must suffer from inflation. Manipulating the money supply and tinkering with interest rates masks rather than corrects the substantive difficulty. The apparent relief can only be short‐lived. The attack on the dollar may stop for a few days and the rise of gold vis‐a‐vis the dollar may abate for the moment‐but not for long. Not only is the high‐interest, tightmoney policy ineffective; it is destructive. It creates its own inflationary spiral. Our private and public debt is at the $4 trillion•mark. Al per cent rise in interest rates creates a $40 billion increase in the nation's cost of doing business ‐ and that cost is inevitably passed on to the consumer. A 2 per cent increase doubles that figure, etc. The Fed's policy can only create a depression. It cannot cure anything. Relief must come from a substantive change in our foreign balance of trade and from controlling and reducing our internal deficits. SAMUEL C. GREENFIELD New York, Oct. 9, 1979 Landmarks on the Upper East Side To the Editor: According to Alan Oser's interesting article “Debating Landmark Designation” (Oct. 3), certain property owners, real estate brokers, and members of community planning boards object to landmark designation for the Upper East Side's commercial areas less on the merits than on procedural ‘grounds. No one, happily, appears to favor tolerating damage to historically and architecturally important buildings or countenancing change for the worse in the character of an attractive neighborhood. What people seem to worry about is that the review process, already cumbersome and slow, and the Landmarks Preservation Commission staff, already overburdened, would be hardpressed, if not crippled altogether, in the face of the increased administrative load that designation of the Upper East Side might create. This concern deserves attention: it would indeed be too bad if clerical busywork were to dampen the legitimate commercial vitality of Madison or Lexington Avenue. But must bathwater and baby both be thrown out? Solving the problem requires not denial of landmark designation but discovery of a way to render the review process responsive and efficient. This might be accomplished quite simply through introduction of clear guidelines, perhaps permitting free design on specified commercial streets and blocks, and through additions to the Landmark Commission's staff, the relatively modest funds for which could most likely be secured from diverse sources, including national, state and city governments, corporations, foundations and private institutions. Since landmark designation offers such positive benefits — some measure of protection for priceless assets and a steady influence for rational development in the interest of longrange economic health — I believe that all civic‐minded New Yorkers will welcome it, if only the mechanism can be made to work. Surely, with good will and cooperative efforts on all sides. it can be. JOAN K. DAVIDSON President, J.M. Kaplan Fund New York, Oct. 8, 1979 To the Editor: Your long, apparently sympathetic account [Sept. 29] of the anti‐abortion propaganda of two Protestant fundamentalists, the Rev. Francis Schaeffer and Dr. Everett Koop, says they condemn abortions even in cases of rape, dangerous illness in the mother or defect in the fetus because “it is a sin to take the life of a human being, before birth or after, for any reason whatsoever.” Clearly these are not Old Testament fundamentalists (the Old Testament is full of killing, often commanded by God — e.g., the slaying of all the firstborn of Egypt.) When they forbid killing “for any reason,” logic requires that they be not only opponents of the death penalty (have they spoken out on this?) but also absolute pacifists, who forbid men to bear arms. If it is a sin to abort a defective fetus, how much greater the sin of killing loved and loving human beings in war. If, on the other hand, war is permissible to avoid greater evils, so is legalized abortion. ROBERT GORHAM DAVIS Westport, Conn., Sept. 30,1979 Blacks, Jews and Affirmative Action To the Editor: In a Sept. 30 advertisement, Julius Lester, a black writer, denounced the recent insensitivity of leaders of the black community to the moral issue presented by anti‐Semitism and eloquently contrasted this position with the moral strength of Martin Luther King's earlier leadership. He further suggested that the present position of black leaders is a reaction to Jewish opposition to affirmative action. Because Mr. Lester's statement is profoundly correct, and courageous, I hesitate to criticize a minor point. But to avoid further misunderstanding, it is important to clarify terminology, and to recognize that what Jewish organizations have been opposing is not affirmative action but a particular set of methods for implementing it. Affirmative action is a concept introduced in a series of Presidential executive orders in the conviction that we cannot achieve racial justice by simply eliminating further discrimination: we must also take positive, affirmative steps to speed the reversal of the effects of earlier discrimination. Moreover, it was clearly implied in these orders that these steps would consist of active recruitment and provision of special remedial education and training so that members of disadvantaged groups would truly have equal opportunity to compete. Subsequently, however, political pressures and bureaucratic decisions led to reinterpretation of affirmative action in terms of reverse discrimination and quotas — concepts quite different from equal opportunity. Identification of affirmative action with quotas not only does an injustice to those who support the former but oppose the latter, it also jeopardizes the goal by linking it to unacceptable methods. Polls have repeatedly shown that the vast majority of our citizens, and even a majority of blacks, are opposed to quotas; so is the Supreme Court's statesmanlike compromise on the Bakke case. It would be a tragedy if hostility of black leaders to those who oppose quotas should weaken liberal support for affirmative action. BERNARD D. DAVIS Boston, Oct. 2, 1979 The writer is Adele Lehman Professor of Bacterial Physiology at the Harvard Medical School. Report of a U.S. Couple's Visit to the Soviet Union To the Editor: My wife and I just returned from a three‐week tour of the Soviet Union. We visited Moscow, Leningrad, Tbilisi, Sochi and Volgograd. The country we saw differed a great deal from that depicted in Catherine A. Fitzpatrick's Sept. 21 letter, “As Moscow Gets Ready to Dupe the Olympic Tourist.” We went wherever we wished. When we didn't go with our Intourist guide, we went by ourselves. We used the urban travel system without hassle or inconvenience and went to any part of the city we wished to go to. We wandered through the department stores, supermarkets, jewelry stores, children's stores and numerous. other retail establishments. We made Purchases and never had any problems. One can shop in the Beryozka shops (foreign‐currency stores) or, as we did, in any store in the city using rubles. Likewise, we found the supermarkets, department stores and shops well‐stocked and jammed like any in New York City. We met people in the streets who engaged us freely in conversation, either in English or in Russian (a couple on our tour spoke fluent Russian). We visited the synagogue in Leningrad and the Sephardic synagogue in Tbilisi. While we were at the Tbilisi synagogue, the shoychet (slaughterer) arrived to slaughter chickens according to Jewish law. We spoke to the heads of these congregations openly and frankly. We met Jews in all walks of life — professors, university students in the fields of medicine, engineering, physics, etc„ a member of the. Writers Union and,cit‐ tendants at the museums. In Sochi we met with the Deputy Mayor for over an hour and had a good question‐and‐answer period, which we taped. We took 21 rolls of 38‐exposure film and have over 700 slides and 12 hours of tape recordings. The only places where we were not permitted to take pictures were railroad stations and airports. We saw housing construction wherever we went, including apartment buildings 18 stories high. Miss Fitzpatrick asserts that “housing construction is being halted to make way for Olympic construction.” Because of a labor shortagas — 20 million men were lost during the Great Patriotic War (World War II) — some of the construction crews were taken off partly completed apartment buildings and are working on the Olympic Village. Further, Miss Fitzpatrick says that Moscow and Leningrad are “hermetically sealed.” We did not find this to be the case. Our Intourist guide in Volgograd (formerly Stalingrad) was a young Jewish woman. Of her mother's 10 brothers and sisters, eight gave their lives in the Battle of Stalingrad to stop the fascist onslaught. Every family in Volgograd suffered losses in the heroic defense of the city. We feel that to equate the 1980 Moscow Olympics with the 1936 Hitler Olympics, as Miss Fitzpatrick did, is to sully the memory of the 20 million who died in the war. Miss Fitzpatrick might do well to visit the U.S.S.R. and see for herself. LEO H. WERNER Brooklyn, Sept. 21, 1979 If All Resources Belonged to All To the Editor: Glyn Jones suggests [letter Oct. 2] that OPEC's oil belongs equally to all the people of the world, as part of our communal inheritance from the past, rather than to some small, opportunistic, accidentally located populations. I could not agree more but wonder whether Mr. Jones realizes the extended implications of his moral stand? By his principles, all world resources should be shared on a per capita basis, and we would immediately become large exporters of oil ourselves, to oil‐poor countries. Further, we would be obligd to distribute our food freely to the worldwide undernourished billions (because it is produced mainly by inputs of land, water, fertilizers made from petroleum and minerals, etc., which are equally the common terrestrial heritage of all mankind). Indeed, the wealth that our society has accumulated in the past has mainly derived from our position as “first exploiters” of major resources. What would keep this wealth exempt from the claims of all the world's poor on a per capita basis? In short, if any world resource should be taken out of the “ovmable” category, why shouldn't all resources equally support all human beings, regardless of place of residence? RICHARD WHIPPLE archrnont, N.Y., Oct. 3,1979 South African Facts To the Editor: Your Sept. 27 editorial “A Step Forward in South Africa” contained two factual errors. • In South Africa, the best jobs are not reserved for whites only. Job reservation affects less than 2 percent of the work force and is limited to one or two activities. The scrapping of job reservation has been accepted in principle by the Government, and restrictions will be phased out as soon as possible. Strong vested interests of white trade unions have made this difficult. To focus on these instances, and not on the 98 percent remainder of the job market, which is completely open, is rather selective treatment. • Mixed trade unions do exist and have existed for years. There were 41 at the last count. The establishment of more multiracial trade unions has been given high priority by the State Manpower Commission.

Compromise Is Voted On a Key Money Bill; Senate Accepts Raise,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/13/archives/compromise-is-voted-on-a-key-money-bill-senate-accepts-raise.html,"WASHINGTON, ‘Oct. 12 — Congress narrowly averted a severe curtailment of some Government operations today by approving a compromise money bill that had been stalled for weeks in a deadlock over abortion and Congressional pay. As approved by the House by voice vote, then later by the Senate in a series of dramdtic votes, the compromise frees funds to keep most Federal departments and agencies in operation. President Carter signed it tonight. The bill provides for an automatic 5.5 percent raise for members of Congress, increasing Senate and House salaries to $60,700 from $57,500. Also part of jhe compromise is a temporary policy on Federal funds for abortions, limiting them to cases when a mother's life is endangered and instances of incest and rape. At one point tonight, the Senate killed the compromise by a vote of 62 to 26, primarily because it contained the Congressional pay increase that it had rejected three•times in recent weeks. But then, reversing itself, the Senate revived the compromise by a vote of 44 to 42. An attempt then to kill the pay increase was defeated, 43 to 42. The Senate then, by a vote of 43 to 91, approved the abortion part of the compromise. The compromise is designed primarily to allow Government departments and agencies whose regular appropriations bills have not yet passed to continue spending at levels of the last fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30. It would permit this spending until Nov. 20. In the meantime, Congress would be expected to pass the regular appropriations bills. In the first 12 days of this fiscal year, these agencies have been unable to pay their employees their full salaries, travel has been limited and, in some cases, supplies have run out. Earlier today there was the threat of a walkout by some Government employees if Congress did not resolve the impasse. Officials of the American Federation of Government Employees called on President Carter to use the powers of his office to “protect Federal employees” and said the employees should “seriously consider the tradition of the labor movement that workers don't work free.” Abortion Fight to Resume Tonight's abortion compromise has to be termed only temporary because it exists only for the life of the compromise money bill, which will expire on Nov. 20. The long, bitter fight over abortion funding might then resume. As the Senate began debate, Democratic and Republican leaders warned that if Congress failed to approve the compromise it would lead to a breakdown of Government services this weekend, with millions of Federal employees going payless or receiving reduced pay, and millions of Federal benefit checks being held up. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the Senate majority leader, declared, “If we don't act promptly, a lot of people are going to suffer.” Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, the Senate minority leader, also urged his colleagues to approve the compromise. “I don't want a pay increase,” he said. “I'm against a pay increase, but I don't want to see the Government grind to a halt.” But angry senators, unwilling to accept the House‐patsed Congressional pay increase, brushed aside such warnings earlier today. If Federal employees and beneficaries suffer, Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr., a Connecticut Republican, said this afternoon, “then it's to the shame of the House of Representatives.” Today, after days of fruitless negotiations, the Senate and House conferees struck a compromise on the abortion issue under which the House agreed to include cases of rape and incest and the Senate agreed to drop a provision allowing abortions if doctors certified there would be damage to the woman's health. Agreement to the compromise came swiftly in the House, with only several voices raised in protest. No attempt was made to get a recorded vote. Some Get Half‐Pay Even before the conferees had reached a compromise, more than a million Federal employees had already been affected by the stalemate. These included civilian employees in the Defense Department whose paychecks today were for half‐pay — that is, for work performed in the final week of the last fiscal year. Millions of other Federal workers may feel some effect next week, because the checks they are to receive — most of them for half‐pay — have already been printed and are ready for distribution. The confrontation between the Senate and the House has been one of the most acerbic In years, with old wounds laid bare and the usual political courtesy stripped away. Senators were still seething over the representatives’ refusal for several years to provide funds for a third Senate office building. Only recently did the House agree to free the funds. House members, in turn, were angered by the Senate's postponement of a Congressional ethics rule limiting the sums that members of Congress can receive from speaking engagements. The House has abided by the $8,625 limit on honorariums, while the Senate has set a temporary limit for its own members of $25,000."

The following announcements came within a few days of one another, three variations on a single theme: Next spring, New American Library, one of the largest mass‐market paperback publishers, will begin issuing new books, both fiction and nonfiction, that “combine literary merit with commercial strength” in hardcover. NAL will bring out many of these titles in softcover later themselves; some they will sell to other firms for reprinting. Early next year, Warner Books, one of the fastestgrowing mass‐market houses, will start a hardcover program, teeing oft with “The War Called Peace,” Richard M. Nixon's ideas about American foreign policy during the 1980's. Some of these books will be reprinted in softcover by other houses; others, like the Nixon book, will be Warner paperbacks. Two separately owned companies, Bantam Books, largest of the mass‐market houses, and William Morrow, a leading trade publisher, have established a new imprint, Perigord Press. Books published under this arrangement will be issued first in hardcover as Morrow/Perigord Press Books, later in paperback as Bantam/Perigord Press Books. This cooperative effort will not affect their other operations as independent companies. Perigord has just made its first acquisition — a yet‐to‐be‐written novel by Gerald Green, author of “The Last Angry Man” and “Holocaust.” Publication date: 1981 at the earliest. What prompts firms that came into being largely as reprint houses, whose sales outlets were largely newsstands and variety stores, to venture into a more traditional form of book publishing? In recent years, paperback publishing has been changing fast. More and more softcover books are being sold in bookstores. The competition for big‐name authors and “good literary properties” keeps growing more intense. The three houses feel that their new arrangements will enable them to operate more flexibly, to develop authors and properties of their own and at the same time continue to compete in the open market for reprint rights to works originated by others. This vision isn't exactly new. Back in 1964, Dell Books, another house that got into the paperback business through the newsstand route, established its own hardcover division, Delacorte Press. Today Delacorte has some 60 best‐selling authors under contract, including Irwin Shaw, Kurt Vonnegut, William Goldman, Richard Bach, Belva Plain, Nancy Friday and Most of the other large mass‐market houses benefit in various ways from the fact that they are owned by conglomerates, members of families that include trade publishers. Pocket Books is a sibling of Simon & Schuster's many divisions, Ballantine of Random House, Berkley/Jove of the Putnam group. There are two exceptions: Fawcett is owned by CBS Inc., which also owns Holt, Rinehart & Winston. Avon is owned by the Hearst Corporation, which recently acquired Arbor House. Both insist that they'll continue to operate “completely independently” of their siblings — or, perhaps more accurately, “cousins.” Sampler. Almost every week a bundle of new paperbacks reaches our desk filled with morsels that cry for quotation. Consider these, culled from the arrivals of the past few days: “Banaria skins are ideal for shining shoes. Rub the inside of the peel against the shoe, let dry a few minutes, and wipe away the coating. Buff with a dry cloth.

In consequence, the pitcher faced west, and if he was left‐handed, he was known as a southpaw.” — From “The Natural Superiority of the Left‐Hander,” by James T. de Kay (M. Evans, $3.95), an illustrated, not unprejudiced folio of facts about 10 percent of our population. “Nine out of ten bottles of London dry gin enjoyed in the United States are distilled in the United States. Today the dry gin capital of the world is Peoria, Ill. Gin that's distilled and bottled by reputable companies differs only in two meaningful ways, flavor and proof. One excellent way to compare the flavor of gins, London or Peoria, is to pretend you're sampling perfume. Splash a small amount of gin on the back of the hand, shake off the excess, and, after a moment, whiff the aroma. To catch the flavor of the gin, a whiff is as good as a swallow.”—From “The Perfect Martini Book,” by Robert Herzbrun (HBJ /Harvest, $5.95), a history of the cocktail, from its birth in a bar in mid‐19th century San Francisco to the three‐martini lunch of contemporary Washington, flavored with old photographs and laced with 268 recipes. “In 1908 Bernarr Macfadden was sentenced to two years in prison and fined $2.000 for mailing a magazine which contained an article on venereal disease.

Major News,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/14/archives/major-news-in-summary-volker-aims-at-inflation-but-wall-street.html,"Shock therapy may be in disrepute in some psychiatric circles. But as demonstrated by Federal Reserve chairman Paul A. Volcker's Saturday night special — a stringent program of monetary restraint — inducing convulsive reactions is still an acceptable prescription for high economic anxiety. Reacting to the need to curb domestic inflation and to foreign pressure for American economic stability, Mr. Volcker moved on three fronts: • The discount rate (the interest that the Federal Reserve charges banks that borrow from it) was raised a full point, to a record 12 percent. • From now on, the Fed said, banks must keep an additional 8 percent of increases in certain large deposits in their reserves. • Finally, in taking its decisions to intervene in the financial markets to help control the money supply, the Federal Reserve, Mr. Volcker said, would place “greater emphasis” on how much money the banks have in reserves and “less emphasis” on the interest rate they charge each other for overnight loans. The banks took the package to heart. Concerned that still further credit curbs might be ahead, most institutions, as expected, raised the prime interest rate (what they charge their most favored customers), but by an unusual full percentage point, to 14½ percent. The stock market was almost contemplative, initially. But by Monday afternoon, selling pressure mounted, in anticipation of the rise in the prime rate and worry about what higher money costs might mean for business investment and so recession. Tuesday was worse. Wall Street's yardstick, the Dow‐Jones industrial average, dropped 26.45 points, the largest setback in nearly six years. Finally, a dizzying Wednesday left the ticker a full hour behind — the Dow down nearly 25 points in the morning, then bouncing back, off, and up again, to close 8.27 down. Trading volume was an enormous and record 81.6 million shares. Thursday and Friday were (comparatively) less hectic, except for exchange employees trying to dig out from under. For the first time in 14 months, the New York Stock Exchange called its employees for Saturday work. For the week, the market's tumble totalled 58.62 points. The bond market was particularly worried by Mr. Volcker's third prong. Many investors simply withdrew. Fixed‐income securities — Treasury bills and corporate and municipal bonds - incurred the heaviest setbacks, bottoming at a $50 billion loss Thursday, with some recovery Friday. What is the prognosis? The Fed moved as it did to pump up the dollar, puncture gold and commodity speculation, and brake the runaway money supply. Last week's figures show that symptoms of recuperation will be a while in coming. After see‐sawing all week, the dollar closed at 1.788 against the West German mark (slightly up) and at 226.65 against the Japanese yen (slightly down). Gold ended up, at $397 an ounce. As New York trader John Crowley of James Sinclair & Co. put it, “It's a nervous market that could go either way.” The market isn't all that's nervous; by week's end, comparisons with the crash of 1929 and forecasts of the collapse of 1980 had receded. But many economists, including Charles L. Schulze, chairman of President Carter's Council of Economic Advisors, admit that a tighter monetary policy increases the chance of deep recession. At the least, the new anti‐inflation program is going to hit consumers’ wallets, as people who borrow especially prospective homebuyers will be faced with higher interest costs early next year, just in time for the first Presidential primaries. With the Administration's private unemployment forecast for next year already at 8 percent, the political perils of the new policy are plain. And clearly, Mr. Carter knows them. At a press conference early in the week, he took pains to emphasize the separation of powers — “Three entities in our Government [the Federal Reserve Board, Congress, and the White House] have been meticulously isolated” he said — and on Thursday, in San Diego, he told a meeting of the nation's construction unions that he would “not fight inflation with your jobs.” Rhodesia Talks Hit an Impasse Zimbabwe Rhodesia Patriotic Front guerrillas blew up a pylon, disrupting Salisbury's electrical supply last week. Guerrillas also contributed to temporary shutdown in London, where they, British officials and the Government of Bishop Abel T. Muzorewa have been trying for five weeks to agree to negotiate an end to the sevenyear war. Presented with an implied threat from Lord Carrington, the British Foreign Secretary, to accept a draft constitution or risk London's recognition of the Muzorewa regime, the guerrilla co‐leader, Robert Mugabe, warned that “if they threaten and flex their muscles, we can also threaten and flex muscles.” The Patriotic Front particularly objects to a constitutional provision designed to protect the country's 230,000 whites from seizure of their land without compensation. (Land and peace, page 3.) “Lord Carrington has his Blackpool,” Mr. Mugabe said, referring to a Conservative Party conference last week where the Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher faced down criticism for being too conciliatory toward the Front. (The Thatcher style, Page 3.) The guerrilla leader added, “We also have our constituency of 7 million Zimbabwians.” Britain adjourned the conference indefinitely, but there were signs of potential compromise. Lord Carrington said that Britain would contribute to an “agricultural development bank” to compensate whites for expropriated land. However, he insisted that agreement be reached on the constitution before the conference turned to the principal issue for the Front: who will control Zimbabwe Rhodesian security before new majority‐rule elections? Share the Wealth, Castro Tells U.N. Some of the fire was gone as Fidel Castro returned to the United Nations last week for his third visit in 20 years as Cuba's Supremo, and this time it was a solo act; Nikita Khruschev and most of the others from the 1960's pantheon are long gone. But still punctuating his remarks with a waving cigar and wearing his familiar green army fatigues, he was rewarded with standing ovations and frequent applause as he called on the few rich nations to cancel all aid debts of developing nations and to start over with a new $300 billion 10‐year fund for grants and lowinterst loans. “If there are no resources, there will be no peace. ... The future will be apocalyptic.. . . Why should people go barefoot so that others may ride in expensive cars? Why should some live only 35 years so others may live 70?” asked Mr. Castro (who is 52). “Why should some be miserably poor so that others may be exaggeratedly rich?” Police helicopters hovered over the United Nations skyscraper and Coast Guard boats patrolled the adjacent East River in an unusually large security operation, as 2,000 anti‐Castro Cubans paraded from a safe distance. (More bodies to guard, Page 4.) Mr. Castro, blamed the United States for most of his and the world's problems, notably the plight of Palestinian Arabs. (The P.L.O.at the United Nations, Page 2.) He said the conditions of his visit were humiliating: “The United States trained the terrorists; now they have the problem of protecting me.” Still fuming, he complained that he was delayed 30 minutes on arrival by United States officials. “I had to ask myself who I was,” he said. “I was a head of state, a representative of the Nonaligned [nations]. I was not an immigrant in the 19th Century who had to fill out a lot of papers, which actually in the end I did not do.” The Pope Leaves, Arguments Stay Seven days, six cities and 76 addresses after landing in Boston Oct. 1, Pope John Paul II returned to Rome. If he showed signs of fatigue as he read a brief statement at Leonardo Da Vinci airport, he was certainly entitled; his nearly nonstop performance had been greeted, as he said in Rome, by “the devoted and exultant welcome of the faithful and of the entire people of the United States.” One thing had changed since the first few days of the Pope's trip, however; no one last week was saying his speeches and homilies lacked specificity. On Sunday in Washington he addressed himself not to general principles of human rights but to particular issues of Roman Catholic faith and morals. On these subjects, his communication was strictly yea, yea and nay, nay.— mostly nay. At the Sanctuary of the Immaculate Conception, the Pope was welcomed by Sister M. Theresa Kane, president of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, who extended the “profound respect” of her constituency and then called point‐blank for the church to provide “the possibility of women as persons being included in all ministries of the church.” (The celibate male priesthood, Page 9.) About 50 of the 5,000 nuns in the congregation stood in silent protest as the Pope praised the traditional religious life for women, including the wearing of religious habits, and noted that even the Virgin Mary was not present at the Last Supper or “inserted in the hierarchical constitution of the church.” Addressing American non‐Catholic religious leaders in the chapel of Trinity College, the Pope seemed to pose new difficulties for interfaith discussions by emphasizing that ecumenical progress must be linked to a resolution of differences “over moral and ethical matters” — not only theological issues, on which there is much agreement already. That afternoon, in his mass on the Mall, the Pope spelled out what he meant by moral and ethical matters. Using the magic words of the organized anti‐abortion movement, the Pope declared: “If a person's right to life is violated at the moment in which he is first conceived in his mother's womb, an indirect blow is struck also at the whole of the moral order.” If many, both Catholics and others, were disheartened by the Pope's language, few were surprised; he had said the same things before. But many believe that the Pope's tone was exactly right, and that his certitude will appeal to people who are searching for just such religious and moral clarity."
In Summary SALT Prospects Are Linked to Missiles for Europe,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/14/archives/the-nation-in-summary-salt-prospects-are-linked-to-missiles-for.html,"The Nation The perceived uncertainty of Washington's leadership among the Western allies may, in the end, turn out to be one of the strongest arguments in favor of SALT. West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt observed recently that the arms limitation treaty had been negotiated with the Soviets by three American Presidents; if it were rejected now by the Senate, he said, United States leadership “as regards the West as a whole” would suffer “a disastrous blow.” President Carter emphatically agreed last week: “Some European countries,” he said, “might very well turn toward the Soviet Union and put an anchor out to the East, and weaken in the process our NATO alliance.” That, essentially, was the argument used last week by the Administration in trying to convince such strong North Atlantic Treaty Organization supporters as Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, to vote for the treaty. But the defense argument has a further wrinkle — also nuclear, negative and vital. If Washington acutely disappoints its allies on SALT, what incentive remains for the Europeans to accept on their soil new medium‐range American Pershing missiles as a counterweight to improved Soviet missiles that can strike Europe? Addressing both the nervous Europeans as well as potential Senate converts to SALT, President Carter seemed to go out of his way to denounce the Russians as militaristic, atheistic and totalitarian. He turned down Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev's offer to pull out some missiles, tanks and troops from East Germany (it required the United States to drop its plan for basing Pershings in Europe). “in effect,” Mr. Carter said, the Brezhnev proposal “is to continue their own rate of modernization provided we don't modernize at all.” Atlantic Alliance ministers are expected to decide on the missiles in December. National security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski, warned last week that their refusal to accept the Pershings could lead to political intimidation by Moscow “at best and even war at worst.” Bonn has agreed to take the new ground‐based cruise and Pershing II missiles—if “a” West European neighbor follows suit. Belgium has said it would, subject to parliamentary approval; Dutch left‐wingers are strongly opposed. The Administration, meanwhile, tried to hurry the Senate toward action on SALT II. But Foreign Relations Committee chairman Senator Frank Church said ratification must hinge on a further Presidential affirmation that Soviet troops in Cuba “are not engaged in a combat role.” The Administration still was ducking a clear commitment on raising future defense spending by more than 3 percent (now planned), a price some key Senators set for their pro‐SALT votes. Promising to submit the main points of 1981‐to‐1985 budget plans, Defense Secretary Harold R. Brown left open the possiblity of new increases. Senate majority leader Robert C. Byrd hopes to begin floor debate around Nov. 1. A sign of how close the call can be came in an closed‐door committee vote on Friday; a motion to postpone action in the generally protreaty foreign relations panel was defeated, but by 10 to 5. Senators last week were forced to accept a pay increase they didn't want to save millions of Federal workers from not getting paid at all. After an angry, weeks‐long battle with the House, the Senate approved a compromise bill granting members of Congress a 5.5 percent raise and temporarily settling differences over Federal financing of abortions. The two issues had held up a money bill to tide over Government departments whose regular appropriations had not been passed by the beginning of the new fiscal year Oct. 1. More than a million Federal workers had been put on half‐pay, agencies had begun to run out of mundane necessities such as lightbulbs, and Congressional leaders had warned of Government breakdown. Still, several Senators, in the showdown Friday night, said they would have preferred that to being blackmailed by the House. The narrowness of the vote (44 to 42) signals more trouble ahead. Congress has until Nov. 20 to pass regular appropriations and reach final agreement on the abortion issue. As it stands, the bill allows Federal funds for abortions when the mother's life is in danger or in cases of rape or incest. That is too liberal for the House, and too restrictive for the Senate. Questions on Energy The Carter Administration said last week the nation had stockpiled enough home‐heating oil to ensure adequate supplies this winter, but it looked as if Federal programs to help the poor pay the 90‐cents‐a‐gallon cost might be too little or too late. One indication of the troubles facing President Carter's proposal for relief to the poor was a Senate Finance Committee conclusion that administrative complexities might delay such a program until February. There was more bad news in Federal reports that gasoline would probably be short again next summer because of new disruptions in crude oil supplies. In the last few weeks, several oil‐exporting countries have announced they would reduce production and/or raise prices. Mr. Carter's energy legislation continued to progress through Congress, with Senate Energy Committee passage of a bill to create an Energy Security Corporation that would encourage development of alternative energy sources and be empowered to build three synthentic fuel plants to spur commercial investment. But competing bills in both houses would give the corporation less broad authority. Early Markers on The Campaign Trail A draft‐Kennedy organizer, witness to the heavy campaigning that preceded yesterday's Florida Democratic caucuses, was reminded of the fuss over Superman. “Everybody knew it was meaningless,” he said, “but they went anyway.” He might have added that the pop film took on meaning when everybody went. President Carter's campaign team and the groups that want Senator Edward M. Kennedy to declare his candidacy have spent nearly $500,000 on advertising, buses and professional consultants for the caucuses — just to influence the election of delegates who will take an unofficial Presidential straw vote next month. At a press conference, Mr. Carter called the contest “significant,” in part to enhance the effect of expected victory. Mr. Kennedy, who has not actively participated, could afford to settle for less. But perhaps the Florida frenzy was significant most of all to Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California the simply because he was the odd man out. Mr. Brown's avowed aim is to knock the President out of the race, then take on Senator Kennedy. But Brown aides acknowledged during a campaign swing through the East and Middle West last week that their candidate was having trouble raising money. In contrast to a Brown war chest estimated at $260,000, Federal Election Committee reports showed that Mr. Carter and four Republicans had raised more than $2 million each. The leader was John B. Connally, the former Texas Governor, with more than $4 million. Mr. Connally also distinguished himself from the Republican pack last week by urging a “new approach” to Middle East policy, based on Israeli withdrawal from virtually all occupied territory. More Ahead in Talmadge Case The Senate made it official last week, voting overwhelmingly to “denounce” Herman E. Talmadge, rather than to “condemn” or “censure” him (as had been the case with the seven Senators previously chastized in the chamber's 190 years). Now, politicians in Washiington and Atlanta are getting set for two further questions. How Mr. Talmadge will fare in the run for a fifth term that he has vowed to make, and will he or any of his aides face criminal action? The Senate vote (81 to 15, with four abstentions) came three weeks after the Senate Ethics Committee delivered itself of the 75‐page product of its 16‐month inquiry. The report, the evidence for which has been been turned over to the Justice Department for its criminal investigation, concluded that bogus expense accounts had been submitted, campaign funds had been diverted to personal use, and that a secret bank account had been opened in Mr. Talmadge's name. However, the report pointed no specific finger. Daniel Minchew, once the Senator's close aide, was last week sentenced to serve four months for submitting a bogus voucher. Mr. Talmadge has consistently denied wrongdoing, maintaining that any errors were those of his staff. Striking a possible campaign theme, he declared after the vote, “I stand before you firmly criticized. But I am not found guilty of intentional, wrongful, unlawful conduct.” Daniel Lewis and Caroline Rand Herron"

Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/15/archives/letters-westchesters-unwise-bid-to-take-over-con-ed.html,"To the Editor: Westchester County's Proposition No. 1, providing for a public utility agency in preparation for a county takeover of Con Edison's electric distribution network, is not just a local issue. If it is passed, it could pose the most serious threat to the City of New York, its citizens and its businesses. Since Con Edison's service area covers all of New York City and Westchester County (except for a small rural area served by New York State Electric and Gas), it is self‐evident that any cost gains by Westchester would have to be at the expense of the city. There has therefore been muted opposition by city officials. If the proposition should pass, that opposition would become much more evident. As a practical political matter, New York City would never allow Westchester to beggar its neighbor. Westchester voters might reflect on the city's past disastrous experiences when the privately owned subway lines were taken over. But those takeovers were triggered by bankruptcy, which certainly doesn't apply to Con Edison. There is, however, real frustration and concern over ever‐rising electricity costs. Yet rational examination of the facts will show that Con Edison is merely passing along to consumers the unavoidable costs of OPEC oil, of excessively stringent environmental requirements, of sales and corporate taxes which make it the nation's most heavily taxed utility. New York City and Westchester should do the rational rather than the flamboyant thing. Both areas should team up to get the state and Federal authorities to allow the use of domestic fuels and lower‐cost oils, and to cease using the utility bill as a tax‐collection device. The State Power Authority's plan for a non‐polluting coal‐burning plant at Arthur Kill in Staten Island is an essential first step toward removing dependence on OPEC high‐cost oil. The state, city and county governments should start phasing out the sales tax on utility bills, thus reversing their recent windfall incomes from sales taxes on Con Edison's higher costs because of OPEC increases. These actions, although less dramatic than a takeover, call for a level of political action and statesmanship that will guarantee real results. The Westchester proposition merely raises false hopes and unnecessarily and impractically pits Westchester against New York City. The proposition has also been touted as the means to secure cheaper State Power Authority power. Yet John Dyson, chairman of the authority, has said that there is no additional power available and that under no circumstances could PASNY “average” its power costs across the state, since that would violate contracts and bond covenants; it would also be fatal to the energy‐intensive steel and aluminum industries of western New York State that rely on PASNY power to be competitive. So all the power‐cost comparisons are irrelevant and distract from the true issues which should be addressed. Financial logic, political reality and regional interdependence all warrant We should all thereafter take corrective steps that are logical, realistic and equitable. Pres., Westchester County Association White Plains, Oct. 9, 1979 If Israel and Egypt Built a Sinai Hospital To the Editor: Your Oct. 7 news article “Israel and Egypt Plan Cooperation in Rehabilitation of Handicapped” gives rise to an idea: What better way to symbolize Egyptian‐Israeli peace than to build a major hospital/rehabilitation center on the Sinai border between the two countries? One intriguing practical benefit: Political leaders would be less inclined to order tanks to crush a hospital than military fortifications to cross a border. Landlord Castro's Woe To the Editor: No wonder Castro has not been bothering to cash the $4,000 checks Uncle Sam has been sending him for the naval base at Guantanamo Bay. We have been paying the same $4,000 annual rent for the 40 or so square miles of territory since we negotiated a perpetual lease with the newly formed Republic of Cuba back in 1903. That's 76 years without a rent hike. In the meantime, we have been spending hundreds of millions of dollars annually for the right to have military bases in such other countries as the Philippines and Spain. As an unwilling landlord, Castro must feel he's stuck with the biggest rent‐control ripoff of all time. Imagine, $4,000 a year for a naval base! In Manhattan, for that kind of money you could hardly find a studio apartment. WALTER S. HENNESSEY JR. Huntington, L.I., Oct. 6, 1979 Missed Nuances in Papal Words for Priests To the Editor: The controversial nature of John Paul Il's reassertion at the Philadelphia Civic Center of his position on the ordination of women tends to obscure three significant aspects of the event. The first is that the overall thrust of the address speaks quite directly to the crying needs of Catholic priests in America. We priests need to be called to a life of intimacy and away from a life of shallow formalism. John Paul centered his address on a twofold intimacy, with Jesus in a life of personal prayer and with the people in a life of accessible service. Both challenges are central to a renewal of the American Catholic clergy. The second noteworthy point can only be seen by contrasting the tone and rhetoric of John Paul's statement about the all‐male priesthood with some of his more passionate statements calling Americans to embrace global justice. In Yankee Stadium his interpretation of the parable of Lazarus and the rich man was as eloquent and compelling as Amos, Hosea or Jeremiah. “We must not give crumbs from our table.” “We must not give from our abundance but from our substance.” By contrast his tone was quiet and less assertive as he spoke of the tradition of a male clergy. Listening and contrasting the two styles, I found myself wondering if this position, explicit as it is, would be permanent. What is clear is that John Paul feels these two positions to be on different levels of magnitude. Both are potentially unpopular in the United States, but I could not imagine his changing his position about global justice. The third surprise was the spontaneous applause, from the priests and seminarians, which interrupted the statement about a male clergy. Given the painful character of this question — embodied in the room by the discrimination against women in seating arrangements —applause was insensitive at best. John Paul did not appear to invite it. Where was the same movement of spontaneous affirmation when he spoke so compellingly of the need for intimacy with Jesus in prayer? Where was it when he called for humble accessibility to the ordinary people of the church? John Paul called much more for these values than for a male clergy. His own personal manner speaks profoundly about both values: prayer and accessibility. I fear that we American priests tend to miss the point. (Rev.) JOHN M. STAUDENMAIER Philadelphia, Oct. 6, 1979 ‘Marginal Souls’ and the Law of God To the Editor: As a Roman Catholic priest, I am left with a sense of disappointment at the end of the Pope's visit. He began as a genial pastor warmly greeting his flock, and ended by coldly exalting the moral elite. Apparently the Kingdom of Heaven is reserved for those fortunate souls whose impulses and opportunities accord with straight‐and‐narrow rustic simplicity. Those whom fate has dealt a hand of complexity and ambiguity in the moral‐sexual realm are, if not hopeless outsiders, in the ranks of the “maybes,” permitted a few crumbs of hope only if they embrace a lifetime of astonishing self‐denial. To those morally marginal souls whose peace of mind I and others have labored to further in recent years, we must now turn empty‐handed; the struggle to minister Christ's peace to the imperfect has become harder, not easier, because of Pope John Paul II's visit to the United States. (Rev.) DANIEL H. MCCARTHY Brooklyn, Oct. 7, 1979 To the Editor: Recently polls have been taken among Roman Catholics. The question arises: Who is Roman Catholic? ‘Certainly one who does not accept the infallibility of the Pope when he teaches the church universal in matters of faith and/or morals is not a Catholic. When the church defined the dogma of the infallibility of the Pope in the First Council of the Vatican (1970), the decree ended with this warning: But if anyone — which may God avert — presume to contradict this our definition, let him be anathema. There also seems to be confusion among some Catholics about the remarriage of divorced persons whose spouses are still living and the bans on abortion and artificial contraception. These prohibitions are divine; the church cannot change them. No power on earth can change the law of God. Most likely, the ban on the ordination of women to the priesthood is a matter of divine law. That, however, is for the infallible church to decide. (Rev.) RICHARD M. PLUNKETT Greenwich, N.Y., Oct. 4, 1979 Toward a Fair Deal for Inflation‐Battered Savers To the Editor: I was dismayed to read the inaccurate and misleading Sept. 23 editorial on Regulation Q and the small saver [“The Federal Pickpocket”]. It was a clear disservice to the cause of rational and informed discussion of an important public issue. Summarized briefly, the editorial charged that “banks” — including, by inference, savings banks — are callously “ripping off” the small saver by opposing the elimination of deposit rate ceilings in order to increase their profits “in the present era of profitable banking.” This charge is then buttressed by the assertion that “there are no corresponding Government limits on what banks may charge or to whom they must lend.” The editorial concludes, therefore, that “those who would have the Government deliberately taking income from small savers for no social purpose are merely condoning a form of pickpocketing.” As a representative of the savingsbank industry, whose primary purpose is to serve the saver, I must point out that your editorial's simplistic indictment reflects a regrettable ignorance of the facts. And the facts must be set forth if the aim is to develop a realistic program to improve the rate of return available to the small saver. The fact is that savings banks are simply unable to generate the earnings required to pay market rates to all depositors in the present economic climate. Savings‐bank portfolios include a large proportion of low‐yielding, fixed‐rate mortgages acquired in earlier years, which prevent us from participating fully in a rising interestrate market. The fact is that savings banks are not free of Government limitations on what they may charge borrowers. Indeed, the low usury ceilings in New York and other major savings‐bank market areas have seriously limited the ability of savings banks to generate earnings needed to pay higher rates on savings. And the fact is that savings banks, as mutual institutions, have a historic and continuing mission to pay the highest possible rates to savers within their basic earnings constraints. Yet these constraints have been so great in the current inflationary environment as to frustrate the basic purpose for which savings banks were created. Your readers would have been far better served if you had addressed the real problem: implementing a comprehensive financial reform program that would give thrift institutions the ability to earn market rates and thus to pay market rates to all depositors. Clearly, the time is long overdue to provide a fair deal for the nation's inflation‐battered savers. The first step should be the enactment of a savings‐related tax incentive, which would increase after‐tax returns. While the short‐term impact on the Federal budget must certainly be considered, a savings tax incentive would have more‐than‐offsetting economic benefits for the nation over the longer run, particularly in the battle against inflation. A number of bills to provide a savings tax incentive have already been introduced in Congress. Rather than unfairly chastising savings banks and other financial institutions, your editorial space might better have been used to encourage support for this realistic approach to the small‐saver problem.

Horse V.D. Quarantine Is Eased,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/18/archives/horse-vd-quarantine-is-eased.html,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 17 (UPI) — The Agriculture Department today lifted a statewide quarantine of thoroughbred breeding horses in Kentucky that was imposed a year and a half ago because some had contagious equine metritis, a venereal disease. A quarantine of the entire state, imposed in April 1978, was replaced with 41 quarantines limited to locations where infected mares were quartered. The venereal disease was brought to Kentucky by horses imported from France. In September 1977, a ban was imposed on breeding horses from France. A ban is also in effect for horses from Ireland, Britain, Australia, West Germany, Belgium and Italy. The disease can prevent conception or cause abortion. Stallions can be successfully treated, but there is no certain cure for mares. The department also said it would allow the public to comment for 45 more days on a pending proposal to allow stallions to be imported from the nations where the disease has been diagnosed, if the imported horses are disinfected and treated with antibiotics. The public comment period on the proposal ended Oct. 2. It was reopened until Nov. 16 at the request of persons who had asked for more time to prepare comments."
Stubborn Fighter for the Poorest of the Poor,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/18/archives/stubborn-fighter-for-the-poorest-of-the-poor-mother-teresa-woman-in.html,"Ambulance drivers of Calcutta once risked beatings by angry crowds when occasionally they were caught dumping a dying man or woman back on the streets, instead of confronting the futility of overcrowded hospitals. Intothis desperation and hopelessness came an Albanian nun, Mother Teresa, to found a mission that gave to thousands something their lives couldnever promise before, a dignified place to die. A stubborn fighter who wears the sari of her adopted India, Mother Teresa discovered her calling in helping “the poorest of the poor” and threw herself into the task. She founded a new Roman Catholic order, the Missionaries of Charity. The outgrowth has been a worldwide network with 158 branches, spread from Papua New Guinea to the South Bronx. Its mercy missions include medical centers that care for 53,000 lepers in Africa and Asia, schools for destitute children, food centers to distribute rice and powdered milk to families that lack the barest means of survival. While regarded almost as a saint in India, where her admirers stretch across all religious, caste and ethnic barriers, for years she was little known in the West. But when Pope Paul VI, more than a decade ago, wanted to establish a home for the poor of Rome, the 20,000 nuns there were passed over as he sent a message to the subcontinent for Mother Teresa to take up the challenge. Her efforts won her the first Pope John XXIII Award, and her characteristic reply to such recognition and praise has been that it is “God's work, not mine.” The 1,800 sisters of the order live under a demanding code that requires them to not merely accept their service to the poor but to welcome it. “The great thing about the poor,” Mother Teresa has said, “is that they are not discontented. They don't hate us despite their immense suffering. It is a mystery we cannot understand.” And in the face of India's struggles to deal with a population of 650 million, she has maintained her support of Roman Catholic prohibitions on abortion and birth control. The people “can have babies whenever they want,” she says. “We have helped 30,000 babies in the past three years. We have destroyed nothing.” Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhlu, the daughter of an Albanian grocer and his wife, was born on Aug. 27, 1910, in Skopje, then in the Ottoman Empire and now in Yugoslavia. By the time she was 12, a pupil in non‐Catholic school but inspired by the guidance of the village priests, she knew she would become a nun. Missionaries from her country were joining in the work of the Sisters of Loretto, an Irish order in India, and at the age of 17 she set sail. She took her first vows May 24, 1928. The school for the daughters of prosperous families where she taught for 20 years was a sheltered oasis in the squalor of Calcutta, and at the age of 36, while riding a night train to Darjeeling, she received what she recognized as her call. “The message was clear,” she once recalled. “I was to leave the convent and help the poor, while living among them.” Her initial request for ex‐cloisteration was turned down, but she waited year and tried again, this time gaining temporary approval from Rome to take a tiny room with a Christian family. Embarking on the teaching of slum children wherever crude shelter was available, she was told by her superiors that her challenge was not only to give a needed service but also to prove that she could attract others to toil in her wake. The Order of the Missionaries of Charity received canonical sanction Oct. 7, 1950, and Mother Teresa took Indian citizenship. “I have been told I spoil the poor by my work,” the gray‐eyed nun has said. “Well, at least one congregation is spoiling the poor, because everyone else is spoiling the rich.”"
Pope John Paul II: His First Year,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/19/archives/pope-john-paul-ii-his-first-year.html,"TUBINGEN, West Germany — Twelve months are a short time. Yet for such an encouragingly energetic and tirelessly active Pope as John Paul II —so many speeches, so many trips —months are a long time. There is no significant issue on which has not already taken a definite stand. After just one year, the contours of this pontificate stand out in bold and unmistakable relief. The intense activity of the Pope in Rome and, above all, his triumphal trips to Mexico, Poland, Ireland and the United States, have presented him to world public opinion as an impressive champion of peace, of human rights, of social justice, and also of strong church, as a man who knows how to satisfy the desire of the masses for a morally trustworthy leader — a rarity in today's world — in a manner both impressive and highly skillful from the public‐relations standpoint. I could continue in praise of this Pope, who seems, amazingly quickly, to have become the darling of the masses and the superstar of the news media (something that has been lacking in politics for some time), already a sort of living cult figure for some Roman Catholics, well nigh unto something like a new messiah for our time. Yet such a comparison makes some people draw back in hesitation. Can one visualize Jesus of Nazareth — whom, as everybody knows, the masses wanted to make a king and whose “vicar” this Pope also claims to be — like this? Does the Pope really have the message of that one person behind him in everything that he so vehemently advocates in dogma and morals? Measured against this standard, of course, anyone would fail. This article is only meant to be an attempt at an interim appraisal, something that, to me, the Pope himself has provoked by his speeches and actions. Is it permitted — in particular, is the Catholic theologian going to be allowed, instead of joining in the euphoric applause of so many people — to ask critical questions, questions that certainly millions of thinking people within and without the Catholic Church are also articulating or sensing? Indeed, for many traditional Catholics, criticism of the Pope, even when it comes out of a loyal commitment to that same Catholic Church, is less pardonable than blasphemy. I, however, am of the opinion, reinforced by the quest of many in our church for a “clarifying word,” that the Pope, this servant of the servants of God, has a right to a sympathetic, critical response from within his own church, a response that tries reflect the voices of so many people who at best have the opportunity to express their views to members of their own family while sitting in front of the television set but who hardly get a hearing public. After all, Thomas Aquinas, who was certainly a very papal theologian, was not the only person to claim that correctio fraterna (a “fraternal critique”) is a duty and a necessity, even visà‐vis prelates of the church. I am convinced that John Paul II, who is certainly not lacking in Christian self‐confidence, will be able take unbiased note of such a correctio fratema. As is fitting for this fraternal critique, the criteria employed here will not be arbitrary and tailored especially for this Pope. On the contrary, what will serve as a basis will be the memorandum that an international group of authoritative theologians published in numerous newspapers and magazines after the death of Pope Paul VI with a view toward the coming papal election. It was tled “The Pope We Need.” I will, then, keep to that memorandum, in order thus to come to an interim appraisal that is as fair as possible; this will be an attempt at an interim appraisal and only interim appraisal. Using the six criteria that appeared in the memorandum, and totally following the outline of that whole memorandum, I will ask six questions here with regard to Karol Wojtyla, and attempt answer them. 1. A Man Open to the World? Following the words of the memorandum, one ought to say: Given all of the inevitable personal limitations, the Pope from Pa land radiates humanity. He knows the world as it is, in its heights and in its depths, in its glory and in its misery, and he tries to affirm the good in it. With all due respect for the past and for tradition, he feels, in an open and critical way, at home in the contemporary world. But is he equally critical and open in his own church, in the ecclesiastical institution? Granted, he wants to be open to the signs of the times, but he sufficiently familiar with the changing attitudes of people (and above all of younger women), especially concerning questions faith and morality? Granted, he is able to speak credibly the language of people today. But does he sufficiently take seriously the findings of contemporary science? Given his pronounced humanity, has he really abandoned the outmoded curial style or has he not rather continued to exercise all over the world in a different, more popular fashion? Spiritual Leader? Measuring the Pope against the words of the memorandum, one must differentiate: This Pope brings trust to his encounters with others, both within and without the church, and he himself supported by trust. He has courage and is able to encourage others, rather than merely scolding and admonishing. He does not want to be authoritarian, but he nevertheless possesses real authority, not only a formalistic, official and institutional but also personal, objective and charismatic authority. And yet, given all of his flexibility and intelligence, certain questions arise concerning this Pope's style of leadership, especially vis‐a‐vis his own church. Does he not, particularly in those questions where probably the majority, even in the Catholic Church, is against him, issue decrees rather than give reasons, command rather than inspire, make lonely decisions in isolation rather than wrestle for common consensus in open dialogue? And this on such important questions as birth control, celibacy, vorce and the ordination of women. Many Catholics and non‐Catholics seriously doubt whether this Pope from a country with a totalitarian regime, with a closed, authoritarian church (understandable for domestic reasons), will in all instances be a guarantor of freedom and openness in our church. 3. An Authentic Pastor? Here also we must differentiate: This Pope considers himself primarily Bishop of Rome and, as such, as a universal pastor. No once could claim that he is only an administrator or a general secretary, a lawyer, a diplomat or a bureaucrat. No, the Pope wants to be a pastor in the service of human beings, a leader resolved not to rule but to serve. He wants to be open in kindness and simplicity to the needs of others in their search for faith, hope and love. And yet, in view of the cheering masses and overcrowded audiences, is he truly free from the personality cult of former Popes, for example Pius XII? Does he not issue strict dicta in certain decisive questions affecting life and death, good and evil, and especially human sexuality (in such complex problems as premarital sex, abortion and homosexuality), rather than give positive guidance free from anxiety? Do not many Catholics, and non‐Catholics even more, already consider him to be, unfortunately, a doctrinnaire defender of ancient bastions rather than — with all due respect for continuity in the church's life and teaching — a pastoral pioneer preaching and practice in the church, renewed by the liberating message of Jesus himself? 4. A True Fellow Bishop? In the light of the memorandum, which was based among other things on the Second Vatican Council, the following questions have to be asked: Given all his verbal assertions of collegiality, has not the Pope up to this time avoided the risk of collegially sharing his power with the other Bishops (on the model of John XXIII and the demand of the Council)? Has he not presented himself less as a brother among brethren than as a monarch over. his subjects (failure to listen and no genuine discussion; emphasis on hierarchy, teaching authority, primacy, infallibility)? Given his present style of governing, can one really expect true collegiality — even if he should raise the status of the Synod of Bishops (or of the College of Cardinals, which is in any case Roman) and should extend even some con crete competence to the episcopal conferences and the diocesan councils? Must he not decisively give up the principle of centralism in the church, revise the papal‐nuncio system from its foundations, and renew the Curia not only externally and organizationally but in the spirit of the Gospel? For all of this, there is no indication to date. Has there yet been a single sign that he wants to grant leadership positions in his Curia not only to different nationalities but also to different mentalities, not only to the aged but also to the young, not only to men but also to women? Is it not becoming increasingly clear even to nonspecialists that this Pope from Poland, as his theological publications and exceedingly numerous official statements demonstrate, is not sufficiently familiar with recent developments in theology (critical exegesis and history of dogma, recent developments in moral theology in North America and liberation theology in Latin America, without even mentioning Protestant and Jewish theology)? Does he not provide representation in the organs of the Roman Curia only for the traditionalist Roman theology as in the past, and does he not even approve of the inquisitorial proceedings against other streams in contemporary Catholic theology, and this in spite of his call for human rights outside the church? One thinks of the inquisitorial proceedings being conducted by the curial Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith against such theologians as Jacques Pohier in France, Edward Schillebeeckx in the Netherlands, Bernhard Hasler in Switzerland, and against two well‐known moral theologians in the United States (I am not free to divulge their names), and one thinks of the libelous campaign against Latin‐American liberation theologians — their enemies allege that they are all Marxist revolutionaries — which has never tried to stop. n Ecumenical Mediator? On this point, too, certain concerns that cannot be overlooked arise from the memorandum: Within and without the Catholic Church, there is increasing doubt about how this Pope interprets his office: Whether on the Petrine model of John XXIII — as a primacy of service within Christianity, as an office to be renewed the spirit of the Gospel and exercised with responsibility for Christian freedom; or, rather, on the model of Pius XII, as a spiritual primacy of domination in the absolutistic Roman fashion. Has he up until now promoted (in Rome and on his trips) —spite of verbal support of ecumenism — dialogue and cooperation with the other Christian churches by taking theological and practical steps? Or, all things considered, has he not instead slowed down ecumenical progress? While it is true that he has exercised his influence as a gathering force for the unity of the Catholic Church, has he really equally worked for the unity of the church within plurality? Has he not, instead of setting an example for a Christian readiness to change, emphasized anew the disciplinary and dogmatic obstacles on the part of Roman Catholicism — primacy jurisdiction, infallibility, Marianism, traditionalist marriage ethics — rather than removing them? While he has allowed the cooperation with the World Council of Churches to continue, has he really promoted this cooperation up until now? Given all his well‐meaning words for the Jews (in New York outside the United Nations), has he taken seriously in a concrete way the spiritual relationship between Christians and Jews? After all, at the United Nations he mentioned Auschwitz but not the centuries‐long “Christian” anti‐Semitism that was also found in Poland. Perhaps by emphasizing the rights of the Palestinians (coupled with the failure to grant any diplomatic recognition to the state of Israel), he may have wanted to activate that which we share in common with Islam. But has he, with his style, really promoted the dialogue with other religions of the world in a way that is both critical and self‐critical? 6. A Genuine Christian? According to the words of the memorandum, one cannot deny: Given his limitations, his faults and his deficiencies, this Pope, who — we can be happy — claims to be neither a saint nor genius, wants to be a Christian in a genuine sense of the term: person who in thought, word and deed is guided by the Gospel Jesus Christ himself as the decisive norm of his life. He tries to be a convincing herald of the good tidings of Christ, firmly rooted in strong and tested faith and in unshakeable hope. He wants to preside over the church in an attitude of calm, patience and confidence, ever aware that the church is not a bureaucratic organization, not a business enterprise, not a political party, but rather the encompassing community of believers. He wants to exercise his moral authority with objectivity, with personal commitment, and with a realistic sense of proportion, taking as his goal not only the promotion of interests of the church institutions but also the broadest realization of the Christian message among all human beings. And he especially sees the commitment of his person and office for the repressed and underprivileged people of the world his special duty and responsibility. Nevertheless, it must now be added that many people within and without the Catholic Church ask: Does this commitment toward the outside, the world, also correspond to a commitment toward the inside, the church, the ecclesiastical institution itself? Can a message to the world to change be credible if the Pope and the church themselves are not the first to change in their own praxis, even, and especially, where they themselves are most challenged? Can the Pope and the church credibly speak to the conscience of today's people, if a self‐critical examination of conscience the part of the church and its leadership does not also simultaneously occur, with the irksome consequences that this might imply? Is talk of a fundamental renewal of human society credible, when the doctrinal and practical reform of the church with respect to the head and the members does not also decisively continue, and when irksome inquiries (as for example concerning the population explosion, birth control and ecclesiastical infallibility) are not finally taken seriously and honestly responded to? Is the commitment in the church to human rights in the world honest, when in the church itself at the same time human rights are not fully guaranteed — for example, the right of priests marry, as is guaranteed in the Gospel itself and in the old Catholic tradition; the right to leave the priesthood with official dispensation after a thorough examination of conscience (rather than the inhumane practice reintroduced by this Pope of forbidding bureaucratically this dispensation); the right of theologians to freedom in their research and expression of opinion; the right of nuns to choose their own clothing; the ordination of women, as can certainly be justified by the Gospel for our contemporary situation; the personal responsibility of married couples for the conception and the number of their children? Should we therefore not be allowed to ask the Vatican why itself signed the Helsinki accord, but has not yet signed the human rights declaration of the Council of Europe? But that should be enough. Some people doubt whether this Pope, who expresses his opinions so energetically in public and who gives such simple answers to such complicated questions, is capable of change, of learning. We sincerely hope so. The first year of his pontificate is over, but it has been only one year. Somel doors are still open, and some others, prematurely shut, could be re‐opened. My redrafting of the memorandum, provoked by the Pope himself, is meant to be of help in this. It is a modest attempt at an interim appraisal as an inquiry and is in no way meant as definitive judgment. But after all, we should affirm in our Catholic Church the words of Gregory the Great (590‐604), one of the luminous predecessors of Pope John Paul II: “But if the truth causes scandal, then it is better a scandal arise rather than that the truth be abandoned.” Copyright © 1979 Hans Küng"

World News Briefs,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/19/archives/world-news-briefs-hanoi-says-relief-program-aids-cambodian.html,"BANGKOK, Thailand, Oct. 18 (Reuters) — Vietnam accused the United States, Thailand and China today of trying to bolster Cambodian guerrillas under the pretext of sending famine aid. It was the third time this week that Hanoi criticized Thailand. More than 53,000 Cambodians have fled to Thailand in the last week to escape fighting. The Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan said that some Thai leaders, “under the pretext of famine relief and humanitarian aid, are joining Peking and Washington's efforts to legalize their revitalization of the remnants of Pol Pot's army.” Prime Minister Pol Pot was toppled by Vietnamese‐led forces in January and is fighting a guerrilla war against a Sovietbacked regime in Phnom Penh. The Nhan Dan commentary added: “There are in Thailand today some people who wish to use the pretext of self-defense to find an excuse to bring back U.S. troops and invite Chinese troops there, transforming Thailand yet again into logistic and operational base against the three Indochinese countries.” Saboteurs Blow Up Four Iranian Oil Pipelines TEHERAN, Iran, Oct. 18 (UPI) Saboteurs blew up four pipelines carrying crude oil in southern Iran, the official Pars press agency reported today. The agency said that the pipelines were blown up yesterday in apparently coordinated attacks on three points around Ahwaz, the capital of Khuzistan Province, where guerrillas of Iran's Arab minority have been fighting the Islamic regime of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. A Government petroleum official told Pars that daily oil production remained at four million barrels despite the attacks, adding that Iran had the capacity to produce up to six million barrels a day. Pope to Convene Cardinals For Church Review Nov. 5‐8 VATICAN CITY, Oct. 18 (Reuters—Pope John Paul II has called a meeting of the College of Cardinals for Nov. 5‐8, the Vatican said today. His decision to convene the cardinals, who usually meet only to elect a pope or approve his choice of new cardinals and other prelates, was seen as a gesture toward a more democratic church government. The Rev. Romeo Panciroli, the Vatican spokesman, said that the session would examine current church issues. “As the Pope has said, the cardinals must be participants in a special way of the pastoral concerns of the successor of St. Peter,” he said. During his recent tour of Ireland and the United States, the Pontiff issued vigorous reaffirmations of church policy and there was little likelihood that his position would be questioned. The Pope condemned artificial birth control, divorce, abortion and homosexuality. He told priests who wanted to leave their calling that the priesthood was permanent and he rejected suggestions that women be ordained. Egypt, Israel and U.S. End New Round on Palestinians ALEXANDRIA, Egypt, Oct. 18 (Reuters) — Egyptian, Israeli and American officials ended another round of talks on Palestinian autonomy today with no sign of any progress. Prime Minister Mustafa Khalil of Egypt said a three‐power summit meeting might be needed to resolve differences on the issue. The semiofficial daily paper Al Ahram quoted Mr. Khalil as having said that such a meeting might be required to “adopt decisions that cannot be taken at the current ministerial level.” A meeting of President Carter, President Anwar el‐Sadat and Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel would need careful preparations, the Prime Minister added. The Egyptian spokesman at the talks, Ahmed Ezzat Abdel‐Latif, said subcommittees that discussed elections for an autonomous Palestinian administration in the West Bank of the Jordan and the Gaza Strip, and the powers it should have, would report to a meeting of chief delegates in London next Thursday. Official sources said the future of the six-month-old talks would be determined at the London meeting next week of Prime Minister Khalil, Interior Minister Yosef Burg of Israel and Robert S. Strauss, the special United States representative for Middle East peace talks. Radicals Set Fire to Trains Linking Tokyo and Airport TOKYO, Oct. 18 (UPI) — Radicals opposed to Tokyo's new international airport set fire to express trains linking the airport and downtown Tokyo early today. The attacks on the trains of the private Keisei Railways caused no casualties and only minor damage to the coaches, the police said. But service between the airport, at Narita about 40 miles east of Tokyo, and Ueno station in Tokyo was disrupted."
Incumbents Are Strong Favorites in Nassau,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/21/archives/long-island-weekly-incumbents-are-strong-favorites-in-nassau-town.html,"MINEOLA THE Republicans have the advantage of incumbency, registration, manpower and financial wealth, so they are rated strong favorites in the Nassau County election on Nov. 6. The Democrats, traditionally underfinanced and lacking in patronage workers, and with no gubernatorial or Presidential candidate to arouse their supporters, are hoping to spring upsets by asserting that Nassau bears the heaviest tax burden in the nation. Taxes are the principal issue that has come to the fore, although the subject of the environment has also been raised, primarily in connection with the troubled Hempstead Town recycling plant. In addition, the Democrats have again focused on the “one man, one vote” issue by starting a court action to force creation of a County Legislature in place of the present County Board of Supervisors. The board consists of Supervisors from the three towns and the Cities of Glen Cove and Long Beach and has a weighted vote system. Joseph M. Margiotta, the leader of the Nassau Republicans, declared, “All our Supervisors are cutting taxes this year and are holding the line and bringing in new business development.” He also expects local Republicans to’ benefit from President Carter's poor ratings in the polls. Mr. Margiotta suffered political defeats in the statewide election last year and in the recent Suffolk County primary, so he is anxious to chalk up a big victory on his home ground. In contrast, Stanley Harwood, the Democratic Party chairman, is “cautiously optimistic” that his candidates will dislodge some of the Republican incumbents. He said, “The recent report by the Nassau County grand jury that tax receivers in Nassau lost more than $6 million by depositing revenues in bank accounts that paid no interest shows that the G.O.P. is guilty of poor fiscal management.” The Republicans are helped by the fact that they have Conservative endorsement, while the Liberals, instead of supporting Democrats, are running many candidates of their own. The anti‐abortion Right to- Life Party is involved in local races for the first time. In one of the three countywide races, Abe Seldin, the incumbent chairman of the Board of Assessors, is challenged by a Democrat, Mario V. Colleluori, who also has the Taxpayers Independent line. Mr. Colleluori, who has been long active in the tax‐reduction movement, is actually a registered Conservative who has accused the leaders of his party of “selling” their endorsement to the Republicans in return for patronage jobs. “If Mr. Colleluori wanted the Conservative endorsement, he should have sought it in the first place,” Mr. Seldin said. The incumbent Nassau County Clerk, Harold W. McConnell, is opposed by Democrat, Roma Connable, formerly an assistant to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Mrs. Connable, who has been endorsed by the Senator, is the first woman to be nominated for a nonjudicial countywide office. The Liber als are also fielding a female candidate, Selma P. Olchin. The race for Administrative Judge of the Nassau County District Court pits the incumbent, Judge Charles G. Heine, against Vincent J. Mutari, Democrat. Mr. Mutari, who has wide experience as a lawyer and arbitrator, has run unsuccessfully for judicial office several times. There is also a contest for State Supreme Court Justice in the Nassau-Suffolk district with a Republican, John S. Lockman, the acting Justice who has multiparty support, opposing a Democrat, Allan L. Winck, a lawyer and Deputy Nassau County Elections Commissioner. TOWN OF HEMPSTEAD Armed with widespread name recognition and a large war chest, the incumbent Presiding Supervisor, Alfonse M. D'Amato, seems so sure of re‐election that he is already talking of a race for the United States Senate next year. “My record in the town is that of accomplishment,” Mr. D'Amato said, citing a cut in the general town tax rate for the second year in a row, an aggressive economic development program to strengthen the tax base, savings effected by conservation through a selfinsurance program and a computer system, a reduction in the town motor vehicle fleet and reducing personnel through attrition. Andrew J. Wallace, the Democratic challenger, has seized on the resentment of residents near the town's new recycling plant at the Mitchel Field site. There have been many complaints of noxious odors emanating from the plant, which has also had recurring labor troubles. The records of companies involved in the plant's construction have been subpoened by a Federal grand jury, and Mr. Wallace has asked the United States Attorney to investigate his charge that Mr. D'Amato acted illegally in advancing $2 million to the builders of the plant without getting authorization from the Town Board. “The scandal of the Southwest Sewer District in Suffolk County began with the same procedure of giving away taxpayers’ money without authorization,” said Mr. Wallace, a lawyer who has background in business administration. He insisted that Mr. D'Amato's cost‐cutting efforts were “trivial” and added, “He can't really cut because he owes things to everyone in his party.” Paul F. Harper, the chairman of the political science department at Hofstra University, is In the race as a Liberal candidate. He said the recycling plant was a good idea, but added, “Better management might have helped relieve the misery it had in the last month.” Mr. Harper said the town councilmen should be elected by districts, a proposal often made by Democratic candidates. Ben Slutsky, a tree surgeon who says he does not have a penny to his name, is running as an independent candidate. Mr. Slutsky said that through the initiative-and-referendum process, he would lower property taxes by two‐thirds. Mr. Wallace has the endorsement of the Right to Life Party, and its leaders say they will mount a strong effort for him in hopes they can provide the margin of an upset victory. In the contest for Supervisor, the Right to Life backers are sticking with the Republican incumbent, James D. Bennett. Mr. Bennett said he had worked with Mr. D'Amato to forward an economic development program, but his Democratic adversary, Barbara Epstein, said he had such a low profile that nobody knew if he did anything on his job. Mrs. Epstein, a teacher and civic leader, has joined with Mr. Wallace to demand a Federal inquiry into the town's Civil Service Commission. An unusual issue has been advanced by Herbert Horkey, the Liberal Party nominee, who believes that laetrile can be a cure for cancer. It is illegal to prescribe this drug in New York State. Mr. Horkey says that if Hempstead should become a center for the use of the drug, cancer patients would flock here, bolstering the hotel and tourist business. TOWN OF OYSTER BAY The incumbent Supervisor, Joseph Colby, agrees with the Democrats that taxes represent the main issue, but he insists that the issue rebounds to his benefit because “I came into office with the pledge to hold the line on the general town tax until the day I could reduce it.” This year's budget proposes a 2 percent reduction. Mr. Colby said that his administration had brought business to the town and that construction was up for the third straight year. He also said that his opponent, a young lawyer, Leonard Austin, had no record of public service, and “it's an affront to the public for anyone to come in and say, ‘I want to govern this town without experience.’ “ Mr. Austin said the tax cut amounted to “table scraps thrown to the taxpayer,” adding, “The real savings would come in having real administrative reform, and we're not getting that.” The Democrats oppose a proposal for a hotel complex and convention center in Jericho and a plan for a housing project in Plainview proposed by the Town Housing Authority. A Liberal, Aaron M. Schein, and Right to Life candidate, Eugene J. McMahon, are also in the Supervisor's race. TOWN OF NORTH HEMPSTEAD The incumbent Supervisor, Michael J. Tully, is seeking re‐election on his record of having “delivered innovative, efficient services in a fiscally prudent fashion and balanced environmental concern with progressive growth.” His principal opponent, Marjorie J. Hueglin, a civic leader and town Democratic leader, contends that Mr. Tully has supported “an antiquated, overlapping, patronage‐ridden structure of town, county and special‐district governments, resulting in confiscatory taxation.” Mrs. Hueglin said the town government had been guilty of lack of planning in the sandpit area and in the matter of incineration and waste disposal. She has also criticized Mr. Tully's refusal to resign from a club that allegedly practices discrimination. The Liberal candidate, Bernard Cohen, has called for economies through elimination of duplication in government, and he supports the concept of a County Legislature to replace the Board of Supervisors. The Right to Life candidate, Joseph M. Mullaly, has proposed one‐room rental apartments for the elderly in one‐family residences. He has also asked town officials to explain their method of selecting lawyers who handle the town's business."
Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/21/archives/letters-the-sovietcuban-drive-to-conquer-a-continent.html,"To the Editor: The leaders of Western Europe, whose nations live under the ominous shadow of the whole Soviet Army, are understandably unperturbed over the presence of a Soviet combat brigade in Cuba. It is quite puzzling, however, why these presumably erudite statesmen have failed so far to address themselves to the grave potential danger that the expansive actions of Cuban troops in Africa are posing to the future of Europe. Within four years, these troops have set up a number of Communist regimes in Africa, whose leaders formally joined Moscow's ideological orbit. The benefits derived from their allegiance to the Kremlin include the license to form a “revolutionary” government (i.e., to rule without free elections) and the installation — by the most sophisticated technicians of totalitarianism — of a scientifically constructed and managed one‐party state. Castro's armed missionaries are in fact seducing the elite of Africa's emerging nations by offering them the ultimate prize of the totalitarian temptation: absolute power. The two most demonstrative examples of their success are the regimes in Angola and Ethiopia, each ruled by a politburo, with a chairman or secretary in its center (after the pattern of the Soviet hierarchy), who can be removed only by a coup or death. The native masses are defenseless in the face of this onslaught, which essentially deprives them of the chance to exercise their right to self-government. They lack the means of communications and social organizations that would enable them to recognize and effectively resist their cunning invaders, who hide behind socialist slogans and the insidious label “liberation front”. Should the present Soviet‐Cuban drive continue unabated, it will in decade turn Africa into a “people's democratic” preserve that will add an invaluable geopolitical asset to the Kremlin's already formidable global position and inevitably pose a direct strategic threat to Europe's soft underbelly: its disintegrating southern flank. The free governments of Europe should give their full and sustained attention to this dire prospect, starting perhaps by re‐examining their absurdly benign view of the kind of “fronts” that are rampaging in the developing countries and are determined to make the whole world unsafe for democracy. LASZLO T. KISS Bronx, Oct. 15, 1979 Connally's Refreshing Mideast Thoughts To the Editor: Kudos for candidate Connally! In his Oct. 11 speech about the Middle East, the former Governor of Texas stated forthrightly what many Americans have been thinking privately for a long time. After the sniveling positions adopted by Rea an, Kennedy and Carter, the approach advocated by Mr. Connally is refreshing. What's so terrible about giving consideration to American interests, especially if they are not inimical to the interests of other nations? The “new approach” advocated by Mr. Connally makes sense in calling for Israel's withdrawal from occupied lands and self‐determination for Palestinians, and in impressing on the Arab nations that they “must be prepared to deal realistically with Israel's legitimate concerns.” What is so onerous about a plan that urges Arab recognition of the legitimate Israeli interests, coupled with stability in the Middle East? What is so onerous about a plan that two decades ago Israel would have embraced as exceeding its wildest dreams? Mr. Connally was never one to shun controversy, and his speech was no exception. But this vigorous and energetic individual has at least opened up a new dimension in Middle East polemics. His campaign should be received as stimulatine. if nothine else. DONALD C. SPEAKMAN Scotch Plains, N.J., Oct. 12, 1979 White House Poetry To the Editor: Until I read your account of the Florida voting results (Oct. 15), I hadn't known that Jody Powell likes to speak in rhymed doggerel. Here is his comment, no word or punctuation mark altered: They put in The best they had And we put in The best we had, And we beat them And beat them bad. To which I add: It makes me sad, to see the ways, we're beine had. MARTIN GARDNER Hastings‐on‐Hudson, Oct. 17, 1979 A U.N. Force Can Save The Cambodian People To the Editor: Why, indeed — as Cambodian journalist Dith Pran asks [news story Oct. 12] — is nothing being done to save the people of Cambodia? More precisely, why does not the United States introduce a resolution in the United Nations to send a massive peacekeeping force to Cambodia to restore order to the country, to distribute food and medical supplies quickly and to keep the peace while the land is being recultivated so that the present crisis does not persist forever (all of which would be followed by free elections)? Would the Soviet Union or China dare oppose such a proposal in the Security Council? Would North Vietnam dare send troops to oppose such a force? Even if such a force could be expected to meet with armed resistance, does that change for a moment the moral imperatives of the situation? (Did the Vietnam War so traumatize us that it has sapped our will to act courageously?) And, finally, would not the best solution of the Cambodian (and Vietnam) refugee problem be to restore Cambodia itself to a state that would be an appealing homeland for the Indochinese refugees? THOMAS R. LITWACK New York, Oct. 15, 1979 More Ways Than One to Curb Population To the Editor: On Oct. 10 you printed a letter from the head of Negative Population Growth. My wife and I are raising several negative people and are interested in their growth, but I was struck by the writer's claim that “since one pregnancy in three is terminated by abortion, without abortion world population would grow about 120 million each year rather than the actual increase of 80 million.” There is also the fact that many people eventually die. This reminds me of Mark Twain's worry about the straightening and shortening the Mississippi until, he figured, it will stick out over the Gulf of Mexico with “negative” length. We can reassure your correspondent when he fears that major political figures tend to ignore population control : Chinese and Soviet leaders have done much, as have the Nazis and Idi Amin. While not stressing abortion as we know it, they often used a post‐natalabortion approach and, as Phyllis McGinley would remark, they did very well with what they had to go on. Even Malthus made recommendations on population control to stave off his estimate that we would have people nine deep all over the earth by 1932, but he did not recommend abortion. Just because one dislikes abortion does not mean one is not concerned about excess people or family plan ning. If you will pardon a jovial simile, abortion is to population control what genocide is to economic growth. RAY WACH Jthaca, N.Y., Oct. 10, 1979 Cheap Shots To the Editor: A major purpose of mental‐health treatment is to help normal citizens experience the mentally ill as persons suffering from a disease that is treatable, rather than as objects of scorn, derision and cheap jokes. Your Sept. 23 editorial reference to “the nut wearing gloves but no shoes” and an earlier anecdote in your Wednesday supplement, speaking with humor about a derelict who unhooked a public phone before going to sleep in a park, are sadly reminiscent of the time when people toured “insane asylums” as entertainment. Such humor and language is as inappropriate as the snide remarks about minorities, women and homosexuals that once appeared regularly in the press. One expects more from The Times. PHILLIP E. JACOBS Director, Substanee Abuse Treatment Programs, Long Island Jewish‐Hillside Medical Center New Hyde Park, L.I., Oct. 12, 1979 Suburbia's Very Real Needs and Very Real Clout To the Editor: Your Oct. 5 Topics comment criticizing the Congressional Suburban Caucus's meeting with President Carter merits rebuttal. Representative Ron Mott! (D.‐Ohio) and I organized the Suburban Caucus in 1977 primarily because the “urban policy” pronouncements of the Carter Administration ignored problems existing in suburban areas. Our 53‐member group, which is evenly split between the two political parties, acts as a voice for the 40 percent of America that lives in suburban areas. Your strident attack is sadly typical of your lack of understanding of suburban problems in general and the political importance of the suburbs in particular. First, it is incorrect to assert that the Nixon Administration's “New Federalism” stands for helping suburbs at the expense of central cities. “New Federalism” is primarily concerned with decentralized decisionmaking. General revenue sharing and the various block grant programs, such as Community Development and CETA, stand for the proposition that Washington does not know best. The red tape and bureaucracy associated with the hundreds of categorical grant programs have contributed little more to urban areas than confusion. Ask any big‐city mayor what is his favorite Federal program, and he'll most likely answer revenue sharing and the various block grant programs which you now attack. Obviously you still subscribe to the notion that Washington regulation writers better understand local problems than do locally elected officials. Perhaps The Times welcomes letters from readers. Letters for publication must include the writer's name, address and telephone number. Because of the large volume of mail received, we regret that we are unable to acknowledge or to return unpublished letters. you think the concepts of federalism are outmoded. I think not. Our point of meeting with the President was simply to state that a grand “urban policy” emanating from Washington will never work unless it recognizes the tremendous diversity in local governance throughout the nation. For instance, the Washington experts consider the city of Houston to be “urban” and Nassau County to be “suburban.” What could be more obvious? In fact, both jurisdictions have similarly sized populations (1.5 million), but Nassau has a geographic size of less than 300 square miles, while Houston occupies almost 600 square miles of land. Which is more “urban”? Obviously Nassau, though the Administration and The Times don't seem to recognize such facts. Consider general revenue sharing. We hear complaints that the program is not “targeted.” Frankly, I am amazed. New York City, with five times Nassau County's population, receives 10 times Nassau's revenue sharing amount. I don't disagree with this allocation, since New York City is a more distressed community. However, areas like Nassau also have problems which need consideration, and we hoped to impress that point on the President. Revenue sharing is one Federal program which works well for city and suburb, and should not be changed. A very real suburban problem is property taxes. It is not uncommon for a Nassau homeowner to be paying $4,000 in tax on a $50,000 house. A similarly situated homeowner across the • border in “urban” Queens is likely to pay less than half that amount. But The Times and the “urban policy experts” in the Administration casually ignore this too. The ignorance of official Washington to the problems of suburbia is even more amazing when a relevant political fact is considered. Suburbanites vote. Nassau County, having one million fewer people than Brooklyn, casts more votes in statewide elections than its sister county. When that fact becomes clear, perhaps Washington and The Times will be less inclined to smugly dismiss the importance of paying attention to suburban needs. JOHN W. WYDLER Member of Congress, 5th Dist., N.Y. Washington, Oct. 5, 1979"
"5,000 Join Feminist Group's Rally In Times Sq. Against Pornography",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/21/archives/5000-join-feminist-groups-rally-in-times-sq-against-pornography.html,"More than 5,000 feminists, college students and community activists marched through Times Square in a protest against pornography yesterday, parading In the bright Manhattan sunshine past the dimly lighted sex shops, peep shows and pornographic movie houses along 42d Street. The demonstration was sponsored by Women Against Pornography, a New York City group. It drew college students from Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, feminists from as far away as Alaska and local contingents from unions, theater groups and neighborhood associations. The demonstrators, who assembled at Columbus Circle, formed a colorful sea of placards and people as they marched down Broadway to the beat of a big bass drum, chanting such slogans as “Clean it up, shut it down, make New York a safer town” and “Two, four, six, eight, pornography is woman‐hate.” Feminist Leaders Head March Leading the marchers and carrying a red banner that stretched across Broadway, were some of the best‐known names in the feminist movement — Gloria Steinern, Bella Abzug and Susan Brownmiller. Their banner read: “Women Against Pornography. Stop Violence Against Women.” The march ended with a rally at Bryant Park, where Miss Steinern, Mrs. Abzug and feminists spoke out against the pornography industry, which they said exploited women and women's bodies and encouraged violence against women. Lynn Campbell, a founder of Women Against Pornography, urged women to go out into their communities and “take action — form consciousness‐raising and education campaigns against pornography.” She urged the women to boycott supermarkets and other stores selling magazines such as Penthouse and Playboy. Miss Campbell also called on women to write President Carter and demand that he form a commission on pornography and violence against women. Amina Abdur‐Rahman, the educational coordinator of the New York Urban League, said: “Pornograpy merchants have lied about all of us, libeled and defamed all of us and given us cause to fight them together.” The women in the march represented a broad range of ages, occupations and political views. Tamsie Rouner, a Smith College junior who participated in the march, said: “There are a lot of feminist issues I would not agree with — I am against abortion, for example — but this anti‐pornography move I fully support.” As the marchers moved through the Times Square area and turned onto 42d Street, demonstrators often fell out of line to plaster small, Day‐Glo stickers on the ticket booths and posters outside the sex shops and movie theaters. But business went on as unsual in such places such as the Sound Peep Classics and the Roxy Burlesk. As the marchers were preparing to leave Columbus Circle, a small scuffle broke out when a group from the Morality Action Committee of Jackson Heights, Queens, tried to join the line of marchers, carrying a black banner that read: “Protect our children.” Several organizers of the march told members of the group that because “protect our children” was the slogan used by the anti‐homosexual movement led by Anita Bryant, that banner and their group could not take part in their march. Paul Morrissey, the group's president, said his organization had been formed two and a half years ago “to work against pornography.” He insisted that the banner was not anti‐homosexual and the police said the group could join the line. At Bryant Park, a man holding an antiabortion, anti‐homosexual poster was tackled by three of the women marchers, who grabbed the sign and ripped it up."
TV: Pregnancy at Age 46,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/22/archives/tv-pregnancy-at-age-46.html,"A ND Baby Makes Six,” which will be seen from 9 to 11 o'clock tonight on NBC, describes what happens when a 46‐year‐old woman, played by Colleen Dewhurst, with three children, the youngest of whom is 18, learns that she is inadvertently pregnant. The situation is not without interest, but the script, by Shelley List, fails to dramatize it. Apparently adhering to the television rule that no scene be longer than two and a half pages, Miss List never really comes to grips with the problem. Instead, the members of the family do little more than harangue one another. Although they are made out to be members of San Francisco's uppermiddle class, their inexpressive, cliché‐ridden speech can only have been learned from soap operas and made‐for‐television movies like this one. Here are a few examples: “I don't want to hurt him,” “I feel like death warmed over,” “I'm getting slightly paranoid,” “He just wants to do some good in the world.” Miss Dewhurst's husband, played by Warren Oates, and her singularly disa; greeable daughter, whined rather than played by Maggie Cooper, and even Mildred Dunnock as her mother, want her to have an abortion. The husband says that they are entitled to enjoy themselves in their sunset years. Considering the three they've been blessed with, he can scarcely be blamed for his lack of enthusiasm. The daughter, who is married to a physician but prefers her career as an apprentice snit in an advertising agency, seems to argue that the feminist movement requires her mother to terminate her pregnancy, but the daughter turns out to have what would appear to be an irrational fear of the pain of giving birth. Unable to develop either her characters or the central conflict, Miss List uses irrelevancies to fill out the time. Who cares, for example, that one of the sons has just been suspended from college and is living with a young Chicano woman or that the other is slightly injured in an automobile accident? The script's lack of content dictates Warns Hussein's inert direction of this Alan Lansburg production. Miss Dewhurst performs commendably, but Mr. Oates, who usually plays characters of the wide‐open spaces, seems uncomfortable as a prosperous manufacturer — of what is not made clear."
Feminists Turn to Economic Issues for '80,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/23/archives/feminists-turn-to-economic-issues-for-80-meat-and-potatoes-issues.html,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 22 — The feminist movement, preparing for the 1980 Presidential election, has quietly shifted its focus from traditional “women's issues” to the nation's economic problems — the impact of inflation, unemployment and recession upon women. Although ratification of the equal rights amendment to the Constitution remains the pivotal theme for feminist groups, the nation's economic strains have abruptly overshadowed other issues because, in the words of feminist leaders, women are stung harder than men by tighter money and higher prices. “We're the first people fired and the last people hired,” said Eleanor C. Smeal, president of the National Organization for Women, the largest feminist organization. “Women working in the labor force earn only 58 percent of what men earn and account for more than 80 percent of the workers in eight of the lowestpaying occupations. Is there any doubt that women aren't hit harder than men by a poor economy?” The concern of women about economic issues is underscored by the findings of a recent New York Times/CBS News poll. Women, like men, placed inflation at the top of their list of national issues. According to the poll, 42 percent of the men mentioned inflation as their chief concern and 36 percent of the women. Those conducting the poll questioned 1,514 adults by telephone Oct. 9 through 12. ‘Meat and Potatoes Issues’ Echoing the findings, Representative Patricia Schroeder, Democrat of Colorado, said that the issues for women in 1980 would be “the real meat and potatoes issues” — inflation, “inequities” in the Social Security system and equal pay for equal work. “There's a new focus on very pragmatic issues,” she said. “We'll be looking to see what women are advising the candidates, what roles they have and what the candidates actually say. There'll be no more of this condescension, no more of this ‘Gee, you're all cute; run along, honey, and make some coffee for us.’ We're organized now and we have clout and the politicians know it.” At this point, key feminist groups such as NOW, as well as the National Women's Political Caucus and the Women's Legal Defense Fund, make it clear that “reproductive rights,” which include federally financed abortions, are viewed as an economic issue for women, together with ratification of the rights amendment. Muting Abortion Issue But other feminists, especially politicians, tend to mute the abortion issue, defining the economic theme more traditionally. Representative Barbara A. Mikulski, a Democrat who represents a blue‐collar district in Baltimore, said that economic security and “discrimination” in Social Security cut across every class line and served to broaden the base of the feminist movement. Miss Mikulski observed: “Women come up to me and say, ‘I'm not one of those women libbers, but I sure want to earn the same salary as the guy next to me, and I sure agree with what you say about Social Security.’ Women, every type, don't want to be placed in the back of the economic bus.” “Eight years ago, when the movement began, the issues weren't as clear,” she added. “Recognition was the important thing then; certain civil libertarian issues were important. Now the issues are reaching across class lines, across regional lines; they're not fad issues. They're persistent and pervasive and here to stay.” Another feminist, Judith Lichtman, executive director of the Women's Legal Defense Fund, a legal assistance group, observed: “People are quite willing to deal with the E.R.A. People are less than willing to deal with abortion. We've always had trouble framing that issue on a positive note. We've all been mindful of the fact that the Phyllis Schlaflys of the world have been allowed to define issues which have split women. “Yet the broader economic issues, such as Social Security and pension rights and the value and worth of homemakers, are issues that bring us all together, issues we should focus on in feminist terms.” Phyllis Schlafly is national chairman of Stop E.R.A., the major opposition to the rights amendment. In drafting strategy for the 1980 election, feminists will have a far more significant impact on the selection of candidates than ever. The Democrats agree that 50 percent of the convention delegates next year will be women, and the Republicans have tried to reach that goal. In the 1976 conventions, 34•percent of the Democratic delegates were women, while the Republican figure was 31 percent. Later, feminist groups are planning strong roles in the campaign. NOW, with 100,000 members, is discussing the possibility of supporting a Presidential candidate for the first time. Other groups, such as the National Women's Political Caucus, are planning to “monitor” the candidates to insure that “they say the same thing in Dallas that they say in Boston,” according to one official. “We have more visibility now, we have more power, but really we have not gone very far, have we?” said Frances T. Farenthold, the first woman elected to the Texas Legislature, a former candidate for Texas Governor and, in 1972, at the Democratic National Convention, the first women to be nominated for Vice President at a major party convention. Slow Political Process “Once we actually got involved in the political process, we realized it's much slower than we thought,” she said. “We realized there's a great deal more resistance to us than we thought. There's no euphoria, just a lot of hard work ahead.” Like Mrs. Farenthold, several prominent feminists voiced ambivalence, if not anger, toward the Carter Administration, especially at what several termed Mr. Carter's “lackadaisical” attitude toward ratification of the rights amendment. “What we wanted was for President Carter to commit himself, to use the mus de of the White House for the E.R.A.,” said Betty Friedan, the writer. “Well, you know, he hasn't done it. If the President had put half the effort to pass the E.R.A. that he used in the Florida popularity contest with Kennedy, we would have had the E.R.A.” Several women cited Mr. Carter's opposition to federally financed abortions for poor women, except when the pregnancy was the result of rape or incest. Mr. Carter had said, in opposing Government help for poor women, “There are many things in life that are not fair that wealthy people can afford and poor people can't.” Representative Elizabeth Holtzman, Democrat of Brooklyn, said, “Life is tough is not a standard that the President has applied to all groups, is it?”"
"Brown, in Harvard Talk, Steps Up Attack on Carter",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/24/archives/brown-in-harvard-talk-steps-up-attack-on-carter-growth-of-debt.html,"CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Oct. 23 — Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, cam paigning in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, charged today that President Carter's economic policies had turned the Democrats into “the party of inflation, expensive home mortgages, costly nuclear power, scarce gasoline and budget deficits.” In a stepped‐up attack on Mr. Carter after his victory in the Florida caucuses on Oct. 13, Governor Brown chided the President for having been “reluctant to take on large oil companies” and for having added to inflation by failing to keep his 1976 campaign promise to balance the Federal budget. Democrats will lose the White House, the Governor warned, “unless we once again embrace the ideals of our party and send out a clear message that we intend to control inflation and strengthen this nation's economy.” “The sad truth is that Jimmy Carter promised to balance the Federal budget by 1980 and he has failed to keep that promise,” Mr. Brown said in a statement released just before he addressed 1,200 students at Harvard University, adding: “His failure has aggravated our serious inflation problem. The value of our dollar has eroded overseas, home mortgages have hit a record level and gold speculation has flourished.” Growth of Debt Cited Although the Governor did not repeat these remarks specifically in his speech at Harvard, he did say that, despite Mr. Carter's promise to balance the budget, the Federal debt had grown by more than $200 billion since 1977. Mr. Brown's criticism of the President seemed to reflect a revised calculation in the Brown camp that Mr. Carter had benefited from the Florida caucuses and that the Governor was going to have to cut into Mr. Carter's support to do well here and in New Hampshire, which the Brown camp privately concedes to Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts. As he has before, the 41‐year‐old Governor set out three major themes: the need to protect the environment, to serve the people by more public control of large corporations and to explore the future. When one student asked how he was I going to achieve these aims and still balance the budget, he replied, “I'm glad you asked,” then reached into the side pocket of his double‐breasted gray flannel suit and added, “I just happen to have 1 in my pocket the secret plan.” Applause Mixed With Hisses That brought a laugh, which turned into applause, mixed with a smattering of hisses, when Mr. Brown urged that the multibillion‐dollar MX missile program be scrapped. The audience responded favorably when the Governor said that “control of multinational corporate decision‐making is a fundamental principle of a democratic society,” and that economic decisions in the United States were concentrated in the hands of too few people. A number of students who signed up after the speech to work for the Brown campaign effort cited his stands on corporate responsibility as well as his antinuclear position as principle attractions. 1 Linda Barnes, a Harvard senior from San Mateo, Calif., who is the New England campus coordinator for the Brown campaign, said that about 110 students had signed up either to work in the campaign or to ask for more information about it. But the statement that drew the sharp est applause for the Governor came in response to a question about his stand on abortion. “I believe every human being must make the decision according to their own conscience and that theological principies should not be linked to the criminal law to enforce one particular position,” he said. Later in the day, before moving on to New Hampshire, the Governor spoke at a political forum at Boston University, met with the editorial boards of The Boston Globe and The Boston Herald American and held a private meeting with members of the Massachusetts Legislature's black caucus. Both last night and today, Mr. Brown spoke out against the level of profits of American oil companies, especially the record third‐quarter profits of $1.15 billion that the Exxon Corporation reported yesterday. He said such figures “should serve as clear proof that OPEC is not alone in adding to high energy costs.”"
Associated Press,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/26/archives/article-1-no-title.html,"In Bilbao, Spain, a woman walks past posters in Basque asking for amnesty for 11 women who are facing trial for abortion. The prosecution is demanding prison terms ranging from 5 to 60 years."
WASHINGTON Leaders And Followers,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/26/archives/washington-leaders-and-followers.html,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 25 — The popular complaint in the United States these days seems to be that we have no outstanding “leaders,” but a more serious problem may be that we have more leaders than followers. Boy, do we have “leaders”! We have leaders in the Senate and in the House, leaders representing states and Congressional districts, business, labor, blacks, Jews, Arabs, homosexuals, abortion and anti‐abortion and many other areas and causes. All we lack are followers who will stand up, not for their selfish interests but for the nation as a whole. As Presidential candidates go, this year”s crop is as good and probably better than most in recent elections. Carter, Kennedy and Brown on the Democratic side; and Reagan, Connally, Baker, Bush, Dole, Anderson and Percy on the Republican side, while they don't excite the voters, are not making many people long wistfully for Nixon, Ford, McGovern, Goldwater or any other Presidential nominee of the 70's. All that the candidates lack is a vision of the coming age and a national following to put it over. Obviously there is a lot of nonsense in the air these days about the potential miracles of inspired “leadership” in the White House. For example, Senator Kennedy described President Kennedy's leadership the other day in understandably affectionate and brotherly terms: “As President,” he said at the dedication of the Kennedy Library in Boston, “Jack was a glory on the mountaintop. The New Frontier of which he dreamed, touched deep and responsive chords in the American character. He could make the lightning strike on things he cared about. He was an irresistible force that made immovable objects move.” Well, there was a certain glory on the mountaintop, and Jack Kennedy did touch deep and responsive chords, particularly among the young. But he couldn't make the lightning strike on Capitol Hill where it was — and still is — badly needed; and far from being an “irresistible” force that made immovable objects move, he was scarcely able to move any of his major projects, let alone his dreams, through the Congress and was almost in a constitutional crisis when he was killed. This was not John Kennedy's fault. When he came to power in the early 60's, the condition of the nation and of the world had changed more radically than at almost any time since the War Between the States. The old empires had collapsed, and with them, whatever order had existed in the preWorld War world. There was a revolution in military arms, in industrial ,technology, and in competition not only with the Soviet Union but also in world trade with our former enemies in Germany and Japan. President Kennedy was not able and didn't have time to deal with all these problems, even assuming that he might have had policies to deal with them all, and they have baffled his successors, including President Carter, ever since. For in this new scientific, technological, social, financial and political revolution, we are changing the world faster than we can change ourselves. Thus, it is not quite fair to blame our present difficulties on President Carter's “failure of leadership.” More than most Presidents of the postwar world, he has taken great political risks to bring about change and face up to the popular illusions about the Middle East, Panama, the supply and cost of fuel, and the control of nuclear weapons. The bet here is that he will get his watered‐down SALT agreement through the Senate, because in the end his opponents are as much baffled by all these predicaments as anybody else, and will not have the courage of their prejudices and probably won't risk the political consequences of an even more dangerous arms race. But where Mr. Carter has failed and this goes for all his other political opponents, including Senator Kennedy — is in not making clear, despite the chance he had to do so as President, that the American people face a different world in the last 20 years of the 20th century and the necessity of transforming their wasteful lives. In this sense, there is no consensus among the people for fundamental change, no education for the changes that have to be made — and therefore no faithful followers of any of the major leaders. This is not to argue that we want a nation of obedient sheep. “We should behave toward our country as women behave toward the men they love,” J.B. Priestley once wrote. “A loving wife will do anything for her husband except to stop criticizing and trying to improve him. That is the right attitude for a citizen. We should cast the same affectionate but sharp glance at our country. We should love it, but also insist on telling it all its faults.” It is a wonderful quotation. But Priestley was asking for fidelity to the nation, and not merely to some narrow faction or group thereof."
Spanish Court Suspends Abortion Trial in Bilbao,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/27/archives/spanish-court-suspends-abortion-trial-in-bilbao.html,"BILBAO, Spain, Oct. 26 (AP) — A three‐judge court today suspended indefinitely the abortion trial of 11 women after protests by feminists across the country. The tribunal postponed the trial on the ground that two of the defendants were not present, but defense lawyers said the court had known in advance that they were missing and said the suspension was granted to avoid further derhonstradons. The case involved an abortionist, her teen‐age daughter and nine women who were her clients in the working class suburb of Basauri. The prosecution sought maximum prison terms of 60 years for the abortionist and 55 years for her daughter, who defense lawyers said did no more than give patients aspirin and brandy. Minimum sentences of six months and a day were asked for the nine women. Feminist demonstrations on behalf of the defendants have taken place in several cities, including one in Madrid in which police drove buses at a column of marching women to disperse them;"

A VICTORY BY SIMON REGARDED AS LIKELY,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/28/archives/a-victory-by-simon-regarded-as-likely-he-is-still-viewed-as.html,"He Is Still Viewed as Front‐Runner, Even by His Foes, in Race for Bronx Borough President The four‐candidate campaign that preceded the choice of Stanley Simon as the Democratic nominee for Borough President of the Bronx has increased to a five‐candidate campaign in the general election. But the outcome, politicians believe, is likely to be the same. Mr. Simon, the incumbent, was momentarily nonplused the other day when a woman mentioned to him the pamphlet circulated by his Liberal party opponent, G. Oliver Koppell. Its second page is a montage of newspaper headlines about the belated filing of financial reports that, briefly, embarrassed Mr. Simon's primary campaign. “I got your literature,” the woman said amiably, “the one where your name is all over page two.” Mr. Simon just grinned. In a political off‐year with little to lure any but the most dedicated — or disgruntled — to the voting booth on Nov. 6, Mr. Simon enjoys several advantages. Bronx voters know he has the job. They remember the headlines that proclaimed him the primary winner. Interest Does Not Abound And few politicians profess to find much interest in what many people perceive as a November rerun of a September show. With an official car to travel in, official programs to announce and two party lines (he was awarded the Republicans’ after he won the Democrats'), Mr. Simon is depicted as a likely winner by his opponents and offers only token disclaimers when asked about his own chances. Asked if he were home free, Mr. Simon replied: “I wouldn't say that, but I feel confident that the people of the Bronx are united.” For Mr. Koppell, an Assemblyman from the Riverdale section, and Joseph L. Galiber, a State Senator from the South Bronx, the candidate of the infant New Alliance Party, this is the second time around against Mr. Simon. Mr. Galiber ran third in the Democratic primary and Mr. Koppell last. The others on the November ballot are new. Terrence J. Dwyer, a lawyer, is on the Conservative line, and Dr. Jeronimo Dominguez, a physician, is on the Right to Life Party's. The competition between Mr. Dwyer and Dr. Dominguez is one of a series of matchups that will test the relative strengths of the two parties, both of which are thought to attract right-of-center voters. The Support for Simon The Democratic power structure Mayor Koch, Governor Carey, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and virtually every legislator around — has given formal support to Mr. Simon. His opponents, all running with little money, speak bravely but fatalistically. “Well, it's an uphill battle,” Mr. Galiber said, “but there's a lot of enthusiasm among the party people. It's a new ball game to some of them.” “Well, it's obviously a long shot,” Mr. Koppell said, “but I promised the Liberals and I feel an obligation to campaign.” “Well, I could win,” Mr. Dwyer said cheerfully, “if some miracle happens, if lightning strikes.” “Well,” said Dr. Dominguez, the challenger least ready to concede, “I didn't expect to win when the Right to Life leaders asked me to run. But I'm getting tremendous support.” Charges Revived Besides a legal challenge to Mr. Simon's right to the Republican line, the Koppell campaign is reviving the primary‐time charges that produced headlines such as “Scotto a Contributor to Simon” and “Roy Cohn Stars in Stanley's Angels.” Mr. Galiber's allies, unusual companions for a politician who has spent his life in the regular organization, are conducting a trial run of what they hope will become a force for change. “Independent of the political bosses — in alliance with the people,” proclaims the main New Alliance Party pamphlet. Mr. Dwyer has revived the complaint that many Democratic leaders in the Bronx live in the suburbs. “How do they know what it's like,” he asks, “if their wives don't walk to stores here, their kids don't go to schools here?” Dr. Dominguez suggests substitution of co‐ops for rental housing. But mostly he talks about the main Right to Life Party issue, abortion. “Because I believe it's murder,” he says, “because I believe it's the same as was done to the Jews in Nazi Germany.”"
A Bonus for a Marriage,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/28/archives/new-jersey-weekly-a-bonus-for-a-marriage.html,"SHE'S old now. She waddles when she walks on swollen legs that hide her ankles and form straight line to her shoes. And it's an effort to get up off the sofa, and more of an effort to make the trip to the store. But she does it because, in her own way, she's very independent. That the independence is based on fear of imposing on others does not make it less so. She is a woman who asks little of life, and she is grateful for any joy that comes her way. Actually, it all went wrong from the beginning, and she began making a habit of “making do” after the death of her mother. She was only 3 years old at the time. Her father, an impractical man, loved his wife, but he soon replaced her with a new wife who didn't care for another woman's children. From her new mother, she learned her disappearing act: the knack of becoming invisible while still in view. She married early, partly because she was so lonely, partly because she was in love and partly because marriage was every lucky young woman's fate. Her marriage was a mistake, although she would never admit it. Once the honeymoon was over, her husband became a tyrant: the boss of his wife and, eventually, of his three children. All her life, she submerged her feelings and desires for warmth and companionship, concentrating on her biggest project — to appease her husband's anger and keep things running smoothly in her home. They were hard hit by the Depression, which was humiliating to her husband, a man who believed that work and masculinity were synonymous. For a short time, she kept the family together with a job as a waitress in a cheap restaurant, another painful blow to her husband. She never gave her husband the money she earned. Instead, she put it in a sugar bowl on a kitchen shelf, where he could get it without the embarrassment of taking it from her. On the bleakest Thanksgiving, she shaped a meat loaf into a turkey and brought an indomitable festivity to the meal that her two sons still remember. At Christmas, she gave each of them membership in the local Y.M.C.A. ; was a luxury she could hardly afford, but she believed it would keep them safely occupied while she worked. She defied her husband only once. It was when she decided that the oldest of her sons would have his chance to go to college, despite the family's circumstances and the Depression. “He's going,” she said when she learned he won a scholarship. “Are you crazy, woman?” her husband asked. “I'll earn the money for him, but he's going.” She stood her ground, and her one and only revolt was a success. She was a woman who longed for approval, and she prayed that her hus- She is a woman who asks little of life, and she is grateful, too, for any joy that may come her way. band would tell her sometime that she looked nice. But he never did. The nearest he came to a compliment was one morning when she was making breakfast in an old green housecoat. “For God's sake, woman,” he said, “don't wear green. You look rotten in it.” When she was 40, she had an abortion. When she was 45, her husband bought their first television set, and when he was tired and ready to go to bed, he would rise from his favorite chair, walk over to the set and turn it off — no matter who was watching it. She would wait until she thought he was asleep, quietly tiptoe to the set and then turn it on very, very low so that she could watch what was left of the show. Her husband died when he was 55. She mourned him deeply and quietly because, during the last few years of his life, he had mellowed and they were beginning to find each other. ‘ There is an indecisiveness that clings to her today and makes her appear bumbler. It has undermined her vision of herself and the way people perceive her. It is not easy to begin to make hard, clear decisions after years of contemplating which decision would please her husband the most. Nor is she above using that appearance as a tool. In her old age, when her granddaughter began going with a divorced man, she quietly went to a large city's Record Office to verify if the young man was really divorced. He was. Recalling her trip through the bureaucratic maze to ferret out the information, she said: “It worked very well. I just looked like a tired and frightened old lady. and some nice young man told me to sit down and rest while he got the information for me.” She is 3,000 miles away now, taking care of her great‐grandchildren so that her granddaughter, a widow, can attend college and earn a degree. She calls that “helping out for a few years.” She writes long, intelligent letters in a handwriting that has become increasingly shaky. At 79, she still gets on plane and visits relatives in the East, and she frequently calls to tell funny stories about her great‐grandchildren. She is a woman of a time that encompassed World War I, the Depression and World War H. Her husband and sons survived the two wars, although not unscathed. Together, she and her husband made it through the Depression. If anyone were to ask her, I think she'd say she's been a very lucky woman. I often wonder if her selflessness is innate or the result of lonely childhood and low expectations. Whatever it is, have always felt that she was the bonus I got when I married her son. ■ • Editor's Note: Today is Mother-inLaw Day."
Candidates for Suffolk County Executive Debate Issues,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/28/archives/long-island-weekly-candidates-for-suffolk-county-executive-debate.html,"FOLLOWING are excerpts from a debate last week at Suffolk Community College in Selden among the candidates for Suffolk County Executive. The candidates are Peter F. Cohalan, Republican; Dr. Martin J. Feldman, Democrat; William A. Matthews, Conservative and Right to Life Parties, and Michael A. Graziano, Liberal. Q. Since the sewer district was the principal issue in the primary, let me start off with that. When will the first sewers be operational? How long will the entire project take? How much will it cost, including interest? And what would you do differently than Mr. Klein is doing right now other than Federal aid? COHALAN: J don't know when the sewers are going to be operational. The County of Suffolk has lied to the people so often that even now, they don't tell us any date particularly, and in the ones I had conversations with the county officials involved with sewers, we still get double‐talk. They don't know. And until, if and when I take office, I'm not going to be able to get the answers either. The Republican primary left a lot of bitter scars among the people of the sewer district, and don't have the answer to that question. I do know that if I get elected to County Executive, I intend to get the sewers finished as soon as possible. The cost is presently going to be over $1 billion at the rate we're going. know that if I'm elected, I'm not going to collect the sewer tax from the two towns — Islip and Babylon — until the sewers are operative. But when exactly the sewers are going to be hooked up I don't have the actual date. MATTHEWS: I don't believe that by putting off taxing the residents is going to help any because we're just going to increase the cost with the interest on the debt. If elected, I would press the bonding companies and the construction companies to make good their work. If we have to bring them to court and if it results in bankruptcy, so be it. GRAZIANO: Frank Jones is talking now about sewer authority, and that means that an authority has bonding capabilities and therefore bonding capability is the same as you and using a credit card. It builds up interest and it has to be repaid. So I would say that authorities, such as road and bridge and tunnel authorities, do collect funds in order to defray the costs and maintain the function they were made for. But a sewer authority? can't possibly see every home having pay toilet in order to meet these obligations. FELDMAN: I was one of the prime investigators to uncover the scandal in the Southwest Sewer District. Mr. Cohalan said that he does not know when the Southwest Sewer District will be hooked up. There is a projected deficit in the Southwest Sewer District of some $120 million over a 10‐year period. Starting in 1983 there'll be $6 million that will have to be invaded in the sales tax. Going up to 1986, $20 million will be invaded of the Suffolk County sales tax. Now Mr. Cohalan has recommended that the people in the Southwest Sewer District not pay any tax in 1980. That means that they must pay double the tax in 1981. Now what I would propose is that we continue on the basis that we're on and look to create a corporation within the sewer district where each homeowner has a piece of the sewer district. In any corporation you receive depreciation for owning that corporation. The people would be able to use that as a tax deduction. You would also be able to possibly refinance that sewer district through Industrial Development Agency bonds— at a lower rate. We are presently exploring that. COHALAN: My proposal for not collecting the sewer tax next year is not going to save the taxpayers any money — I never have said it would. What will do is restore credibility to the taxpayers because of the fact that they will be dealing with a county government that is telling them the truth. Q.: What do you see realistically as the prospect for low‐cost electricity after Shoreham? FELDMAN: I am not prepared to say that I am ready to see Shoreham opened. I don't think Lilco has proved that it is safe. There is no evacuation plan and I also don't think that we can evacuate safely off Long Island. We have a hard enough time evacuating in rush hours, let alone evacuating there were any nuclear meltdowns at the Shoreham plant. I propose that Nassau and Suffolk County get together and create a longrange strategy for energy. We have to look at how we bring oil into this county. We do not have a pipeline. We do not have a deep water port. And what that means is that the cost of oil and gasoline is always highest on Long Island because there is no way of getting here and the costs keep escalating. GRAZIANO: There are an awful lot of naïve people around here who are going to depend on things that don't happen. A lot of people are going into hock and are taking another mortgage out in order to put solar heating in and then when they have it thoroughly insulated and the solar heating is in, then they suddenly realize that Lilco is not selling enough energy so therefore they ask for an increase and the poor guy is straddled with the idea of paying off for the work he has done on his house and still paying the higher rates. So you have to consider human nature when you're dealing with these things. MATTHEWS: I do favor the opening of the Shoreham nuclear plant. In the long future I believe we will have to look into the other sources of energy such as solar energy, wind energy. These are 10 to 15 years oft. It's taking us about 13 years just to build the Shoreham nuclear plant. So therefore you have to project your energy use over the next 13 years in order to come up with an alternative. I also hold the Right to Life Party designation. If thought it was risky, I don't think in good conscience I could hold that line and call for the opening of the Shoreham nuclear plant. COHALAN: I think the important question here on the issue of nuclear power is what is the bottom line in terms of public health, safety and welfare. I fear nuclear power. That's the reason I'm opposed to Jamesport, and that's the reason I'm committed to have the county oppose the Shoreham going on line until we have all questions answered as to an evacuation plan. Q. Next to the use of nuclear energy to help provide electrical power in the Shoreham plant, probably the most emotionally‐debated issue is the use of public funds for abortion. Just what is your view on that subject? MATTHEWS: I believe abortion is murder. I'm against the county funding of it. As long as the state has the power over whether it's county funded or not, I do not believe we should also be funding pre‐planned parenthood, advertisements for abortion clinics, this type of thing. I believe that we should also, if we're going to do that, we should offer the alternative, which is adoption. COHALAN: I am not a right-to-lifer. I feel that there are definitely exceptions, at least in my mind, to the rightto‐life position. I don't favor use of public funds for abortion. GRAZIANO: I must confess that I'm confused in trying to rationalize the voting behavior of our elected state legislators as to whether they are interested in the well‐being of our total constituency or subjecting their conscience to the whim of a vociferous minority. In the question of funding for abortiond, the latest figures available indicate that in New York State 5,111 abortions took place at an average cost of $153 per. If these females were forced to have the child and invariably end up on social service welfare, it would cost the taxpayer approximately $8,000 to $10,000 per year for 16 years until that child and mother can fend for themselves. I as a taxpayer don't want my tax dollars to support a system of enforced welfare for my lifetime, my children's lifetime and soon to perpetuity. FELDMAN: The Supreme Court ruled that the states have the option to determine whether they want to fund abortion. The County Social Service Department is an agency of the state and as long as the state determined that we are going to fund abortion, the county has no other option but to continue to fund abortion, and I voted for that. However, I am personally opposed to abortion, but I do not think that the government should regulate our lives or regulate abortion. Q. Are you satisfied with what the Long Island Rail Road is doing to improve its service? Are you supporting the transportation bond issue and do you think it responds to the needs of the island? FELDMAN: No, I'm not satisfied, and I wasn't satisfied back in 1973 when I proposed a comprehensive transportation plan and in ‘74 and ‘75 when, along with Legislator Mike Grant, Republican from Brentwood, we designed and implemented a dial-a-ride system in the Brentwood‐Central Islip area. The biggest problem that we have in Suffolk County and basically on Long Island, more so in Suffolk County, is transportation and both aspects of transportation — that is freight transportation and commuter transportation. Suffolk County needs a commuter transportation system. The bond issue is vital to that particular cause. COHALAN: No mass transportation system in the United States operates without massive public subsidy, and if elected County Executive I do intend to commit substantial subsidies without involving a property tax increase by the infusion of $10 million over the next four years at the rate of $2.5 million year by taking this money from the capital budget and moving it over to the operating budget. The beginnings of a major mass transportation system in Suffolk County can be done — we have been studying other areas of the country where this has occurred — and we need it desperately in Suffolk County to take care of the poor people who can't get to where they want to go, the senior citizens on fixed incomes, the handicapped people. In terms of the transportation bond issue, I favor that. I think it is going to lead to the electrification of the Long Island Rail Road eventually, even though that isn't covered by the transportation bond issue. I also favor the use and development of the Ronkonkoma railroad station as a major transportation hub for air, rail and auto center and I'm one of the prime movers in that. MATTHEWS: I'm in favor of the transportation bond issue, for many reasons. I believe it's a first step in getting electrification out here. But I want the voters to know that it is only a first step. This means the purchase of 72 cars, which is needed to go on electrification. But I think the biggest thing that this is going to do is provide a better freight system. We are paying exhorbitant freight costs to get our goods onto the island. What this money will do is provide a way to raise bridges such as Hellgates Bridge, which is the lowest one, in order to put trailers onto the railroads to get them out here at much lower cost than regular trucking. This is one of our biggest problems. Our unemployment problem is very bad. We are losing jobs. I believe that we should be utilizing Federal funds to increase the efficiency of our trains, bus thoroughfares or mass transit and then be able to turn it over to industry as much as possible. Q: With nearly every voter having daily to readjust his own budget because of inflation and whatever else is happening to the dollar, what would you as County Executive do to adjust the county budget? How would cut back, if possible, and what areas do you feel could take the cutting? FELDMAN: An area which has really not been looked at sufficiently is the area of social services, which accounts for 36.2 percent of the entire budget. In 1977, I attempted to consolidate part of the community service administraiton budget by removing or bumping back some provisional employes that were added on when the county moved toward a program of despecialization. These employes are actually superfluous. What really has to be done is more services must be given to the people without having top‐heavy administration. There are many other areas in county government where we use consultation services. There is no reason why we have to run a government by consultation which costs us tremendous amount of taxpayer dollars and actually is a duplication for the taxpayer. COHALAN: I would set up an enterprise fund as I have done in Islip Township where nonessential services are put on a pay-as-you-go basis. We have found that we have been able to actually cut the budget. For instance, our town marinas have been made to pay for themselves and other town functions also in the field of recreation have been made to pay for themselves. would do the same thing as county executive. Q: Which services are those? A. Recreation programs that we have in the Town of Islip, the use of county parks I think in certain areas, yes, the use of county marinas—where the government is actually competing with private enterprise. I think that those types of programs should be put on a pay-as-you-go basis. The county itself gets over $1.2 million from the state for snow‐removal funds. I would press for the state payment for court officer training at the county police academy and by securing increased aid for our county community college. think we have to pursue more New York State aid for cultural activities. The Town of Islip has been able to receive state aid for all sorts of cultural activities from chamber music societies right through to and including the big bands. Another thing we should get out of in this county is renting facilities all over the place helter skelter from people whom I bet if you checked some of them happen to be friends of Nicholas Barbato or some other well‐fixed county Republican party politician. And I think we should go after those people also and where we can phase out those leases and put the people who are presently in those rented facilities as much as possible into county‐owned buildings. FELDMAN: I'd like to discuss this double payment or double taxation because I don't know where else you're going to squeeze it from the taxpayer. They are presently paying, if you'd ever open the budget, Peter, to page 22, they're presently paying $1,231,000 in park recreation charges, camping fees, recreation concession, beach pool charges, marina and docks, golf charges, charges for park employees and park refuse and garbage charges. So we already are getting the monies that you are talking about. Are you going to start charging when a policeman makes a house call? The other thing I'd like to discuss is what you're talking about renting facilities. I exposed the scandal that we had when Simontov Capon was the Commissioner of Buildings and Grounds. I exposed that scandal. It was a rental and a kickback for renting buildings. And you're absolutely correct. There are many areas where we have this problem and that's why I have proposed a commissioner of investigations to weed the rest of it out. COHALAN: There's one area where I feel, and Dr. Feldman alluded to it before, the county really can't cut back this year. We're going into a bad recession brought on by the fiscal policies of President Carter and I think this is the wrong time to cut welfare in this county other than fraud. It's the wrong time to cut back on welfare because the people who can't take care of themselves must be cared for by the county government, by the state government etcetera. And we do have a high welfare incidence in this county and on that particular issue I think he mentioned before that we should possibly cut back on welfare. think excluding fraud and tightening up our welfare checking procedures that we should show the government has a heart and the government wants to take care of the people who can't take care of themselves. Q. What assurances does the Suffolk County resident have that your administration would be far different from Mr. Klein's in his relationship with the Republican organization? COHALAN: I took on the Republican Party in the Republican Party primary on September the 11th. I took on the leaders of eight out of the 10 towns. had support only from the Town of Babylon and the Town of Islip in terms of town leaders. I also took on Joe Margiotta, the Republican leader of Nassau County, who sent in people and money and materiel to try and defeat me. also took on Ronald Reagan plus the whole state Republican congressional delegation, all of whom supported John Klein and came in and made appearances for him. And Reagan also came in and made appearances for him. And in taking on the whole Republican Party apparatus, we beat them by more than 2‐1 because the public is screaming out that it's time for a change and they don't want the old business as usual. I am an independent Republican to the point where my Democratic opponent Martin Feldman has said that he's not going to bring up the issue of bossism any more because of the fact that I have shown my independence by saying nice things about three Democratic candidates for Town Supervisor and outright endorsing one. So that's four out of 10 Democratic candidates for Town Supervisor in this county about whom I have said nice things. And I stand on my prior statements in that regard about those four gentlemen. FELDMAN: The point is that he is product of the loosely knit confederation of Republican leaders that have given this county the Huntington dock scandal in 1962, the Islip land scandals, the Southwest Sewer District, the Capon scandal where we rent buildings. The Republican Party has been in power in Suffolk County for more than 30 years. We have no transportation, no jobs, we have the highest tax rate or the second‐highest tax rate in the United States. The Town of Islip has the first highest tax rate of all the towns, has more political jobs, has more positions in its budget and the Supervisor happens to be paid $41,000 more than any supervisor in the entire County of Suffolk. Mr. Cohalan cannot extricate himself from the political scene of this loosely knit confederation of Republican leaders and when he tells us that he has done it, he has not proved it. COHALAN: I'm glad Marty brought up the Islip land scandal. I ran against that and won as Supervisor in 1971 in a Republican Party primary against some of the people involved in the Islip land scandal. There are honorable Republicans in this county. Sure there have been Republican crooks and there've been Democratic crooks too. But there are honorable Republicans. And I remind you that the Democrats ran this county for many years under H. Lee Dennison and I remind you that there are a number of Democratic Town Supervisors right now and there have been in this county for many, many years. But neither party has monopoly either on good or corruption. There are good and bad in both major parties. I don't care who it is that's doing wrong — to me, party loyalty stops at acts of omission, commission, malfeasance, misfeasance or corruption. MATTHEWS: I'm an accountant. I've been an accountant for 12 years. believe one of the biggest problems that we have in Suffolk County is the taxes and lack of jobs, industry and welfare. My proposals would be to induce industry into this area to provide jobs to cut unemployment, cut the welfare rolls before cutting our costs. That way we lower the crime rate because by giving people jobs, the crime rate goes down. I believe that we will have to look at Suffolk and Peconic County as two different counties. I spent the weekend in the five eastern towns. They do not want industry. They do not want the bridge. They do not want extended highways. We of the five western towns, we feel differently. We need jobs. We have very high unemployment that we need to satisfy through industry. We're going to have to take a look at it. FELDMAN : If this county is to survive and prosper, we must have county executive who has the depth of understanding and ability to act decisively on every issue that effects the lives of the public at large and that has meaning to each individual citizen. COHALAN: The principal issue in this campaign is who is best qualified to lead Suffolk County in the 1980's. People have lost confidence in their county government and they want new leadership — leadership that is dynamic, innovative, open and free from scandal and corruption. They want leaders who are tough, who will make the tough decisions, who are not afraid to take on the political, power brokers. I believe have the track record to provide that kind of leadership.

Supreme Court to Rule On Patenting Life Forms,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/30/archives/supreme-court-to-rule-on-patenting-life-forms-economic-implications.html,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 29 — The Supreme Court agreed today to resolve a question of increasing commercial importance in an era when new life forms can be readily created in the laboratory: whether the patent laws allow patents for living organisms. At issue are patents for two microorganisms, awarded by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals in a reversal of the United States Patent and Trademark Office and its Board of Appeals. One of the patents is for Streptomyces vellosus, an organism isolated in 1979 by three scientists for the Upjohn Company. The organism is used in preparing the antibiotic lincomycin. The other patent is for Pseudomonas, a bacterium created through genetic engineering by a scientist at the General Electric Company. The bacterium is capable of “eating” oil spills by breaking down several components of petroleum as it floats on the ocean. The Patent Office, backed by the Justice Department, takes the view that Congress never intended to include living things within the scope of the general patent laws. The fact that Congress later provided for the patentability of certain plants, the Government says, shows that living beings in general were excluded from the 19th‐century enactments that form the basis of modern Patent law. ‘Economic Implications’ Cited In asking the Supreme Court to take the case, Parker v. Bergy, the Justice Department said that the appeals court had exceeded its authority in reversing the Patent Office's finding. “Economic implications of that holding are very significant, given the vast area that it opens to patentability,” the Government's brief said. In its decision last March, the appeals court had belittled the Government's argument that awarding the contested patents would have serious consequences for patent law. “'The sky is falling! The sky is falling!’ cried Chicken Little,” said the opinion by Judge Giles S. Rich for the five‐member appeals court. “Come, let us return to reason.” The opinion also observed that Louis Pasteur had obtained a patent for a form of yeast. “Yeast is alive,” Judge Rich said, “else we would not have beer, and bread would not rise.” The Supreme Court has not been enthusiastic recently about broad interpretations of the patent laws. In a 1978 case, Parker v. Flook, the Court held that a claim for an improved method of mathematical calculation was not patentable. The Government's appeal from one of the patent determinations involved in today's case was then before the Supreme Court. The Court sent the case back to the appeals court with instructions to reconsider its conclusion “in light of” the Parker v. Flook decision. “To conclude on the light Flook sheds on these cases,” Judge Rich wrote, “very simply, we find none.” Land Sale Contracts In another action today, the Supreme Court refused to review an Illinois state court decision that contracts for the purchase of residential real estate lots are “investment contracts” within the meaning of the Federal securities laws. The Grand Bahama Development Company, a land developer being sued by its customers for alleged failure to disclose significant information, had urged the Supreme Court to reverse the lower court's decision and dismiss the lawsuit. The Supreme Court has never decided whether land sales come under the disclosure requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. Other lower courts, in contrast to the Illinois court, have held that they do not. Abortion Practice The Supreme Court declined to block the trial of an antitrust suit brought by a nonprofit abortion clinic in Florida against the director of the Florida State Board of Medical Examiners and five doctors on the staff of Tallahassee Memorial Hospital. The Feminist Women's Health Center brought the suit, alleging that the defendants had conspired to monopolize the practice of abortions in the area and to drive the clinic out of business. The lower court awarded judgment to the defendants before trial, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed and said the clinic was entitled to try to prove its case. The defendants sought Supreme Court review on the ground that Federal court jurisdiction under the antitrust laws was lacking. Utilities’ Viewpoint The Supreme Court turned down a request to hear a second, related appeal from an order by the New York State Public Service Commission prohibiting utilities from using bill inserts to express their views on controversial public issues. On Oct. 1 the Court agreed to hear Consolidated Edison's appeal from a New York State Court of Appeals opinion that upheld the ban. The Long Island Lighting Company also brought a First Amendment (free speech) challenge to the ban, but it did so in Federal court rather than state court. The utility lost in Federal District Court last March, and arguments were held this month before the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Both Lilco and the Scientists’ Institute for Public Information, whose original complaint about the utilities’ inserts concerning a pronuclearenergy bill had led to the ban, had asked the Supreme Court to bypass the Court of Appeals and consolidate the case with the Con Edison appeal."
Phyllis George: Half of a Glamorous Campaign,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/30/archives/phyllis-george-half-of-a-glamorous-campaign-taken-state-by-storm.html,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. ‐ It's been called “the kissing campaign,” and it's easy to see why. John Y. Brown Jr., Kentucky's Democratic candidate for Governor, and his wife of seven months, Phyllis George, constantly hug and kiss like newlyweds on the campaign trail. And everybody in Kentucky, it seems, wants to kiss the former Miss America turned television personality. “Oh, Phyllis, Phyllis, please kiss my husband, please!” a plump young woman asked the candidate's wife during a recent campaign stop at the Harvest Festival in Crestwood, Ky. The 30‐yearold Mrs. Brown smilingly obliged, then continued making her way through the crowd, signing autographs and kissing (and being kissed by) everyone from babies to senior citizens. At times like this, her handsome, 45‐year‐old husband, who parlayed Colonel Sanders's Kentucky Fried Chicken recipe into an estimated $35 million personal fortune, is likely to say something self‐deprecating to the crowd like, “I've been walking behind her ever since we met,” or “Doesn't anyone want my autograph?” Phyllis George Brown, as she began calling herself after a crusty mountaineer pointed out that Kentucky women use their husbands' last names, candidly admits that one of her main values to the campaign has been to draw crowds. “They used to call me Flypaper Phyllis,” she said with her familiar, ever‐present smile as her campaign car sped back to Louisville. “But what was John supposed to do, hide me in the closet? I am his wife, and I have the right to be beside him.” Taken State by Storm The John and Phyllis Show, as some Kentuckians call it, seems to have taken the Bluegrass State by storm. Recent polls showed Mr. Brown well ahead of his Republican opponent in the Nov. 6 election, former Gov. Louie B. Nunn. Commenting on Mrs. Brown's importance to the campaign, Robert Cobb, the Brown campaign coordinator, said he thought that “John Y.,” as the candidate is known here, would not have won the crowded Democratic primary last May 29 without his wife's help on the campaign. Almost every day since Mr. Brown entered the gubernatorial race shortly after the couple's St. Patrick's Day wedding, his wife has been at his side, sitting in on his strategy sessions and flying across the state with him, her huge pear‐shaped diamond engagement ring glittering in the sun. Invariably, she would introduce her husband at a campaign stop, adding an aside intended to blunt any suspicions that she was a “carpetbagger.” In Crestwood, she told the crowd, “I'm from Texas, and lived there for 21 years, and never thought I could live anywhere else.” Long pause. “But this is my old Kentucky home.” One of Mrs. Brown's biggest efforts for the campaign was a rally called “Kentucky's Salute to Women of the 80's,” which drew almost 2,000 people to the Commonwealth Convention Center in Louisville on Sunday. The event, which Mrs. Brown insisted was “nonpolitical,” drew such prominent female speakers as Representative Patricia Schroeder, Democrat of Colorado; Azie Taylor Morton, Treasurer of the United States; Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro, Democrat of New York; Dorothy Height, president of the National Council of Negro Women, and Mildred O'Neill, wife of the Speaker of the House. But Mrs. Brown's repeated insistence on the nonpartisan nature of the rally, which was sponsored by the Kentucky State Democratic Party, angered some Kentuckians. “If she'd lie and say this wasn't a political rally, who knows what she'd say in the future about other things?” said one Louisville man who attended the rally. Kissing for the Cameras Other Kentuckians have been criticial of the Browns' hugging and kissing, which seems to become more pronounced whenever cameras are aimed at them. Beula Nunn, the 65‐year‐old wife of the Republican candidate, said in a recent inteview that she didn't plan to bite her husband's ear in public during the campaign. When asked about the criticism that she and her husband were overly affectionate in public, Mrs. Brown said: “That's tough. I just hope maybe some of it will rub off on other people, and they will be as full of love as we are.” What was it like going from the glamorous world of television to campaigning for public office? “For the first two weeks, it was very difficult to adjust to the life,” Mrs. Brown said. “I didn't have any friends here, and once I flew back to my apartment in New York and broke down and cried in my press agent's office. I made a big sacrifice in my career coming down here, and I remind John of that a lot. Once when I was feeling depressed, he told me he'd buy me a horse. I said, “How good a horse?” He said, “A very good horse.” Mrs. Brown added that she had been “disillusioned” by the “mudslinging tactics” used when the Republicans began to attack the Browns’ “jet‐set life style,” specifically Mr. Brown's alleged fondness for high stakes gambling and the couple's attendance at a party at a New York discothèque (Xenon) that had been featured in Penthouse magazine. “But basically, show business is politics,” she added. “If you work for a network, as I did, it's who you know that counts. And politics, with its media blitz, is very much show biz. What matters is whether a candidate is handsome, and articulate, and has a good smile. The big difference is that politics is real, very real, and that show business is a fantasy world.” The Browns first met two years ago at an professional football playoff game in Minneapolis, where they were introduced by the odds maker Jimmy (the Greek) Snyder. As the story goes, Mr. Brown had been wanting to meet Miss George ever since the night his divorce from his first wife, Ellie, who ran his unsuccessful Kentucky Colonels basketball team, became final, and he caught a glimpse of Miss George on television. He supposedly told a friend at the time, “I think I'll out with her.” Miss George, however, was married soon after to Robert Evans, the Hollywood movie producer. Then last November, after her 11‐month marriage had broken up, Miss George ran into Mr. Brown at a Hollywood party. He proposed two months later, and they were married last St. Patrick's Day in New York's Marble Collegiate Church by the Rev. Norman Vincent Peale, who urged them to “go out and serve God together.” Mrs. Brown said that if she becomes First Lady of Kentucky, her major projects will be working with retarded and handicapped children (she is honorary Kentucky chairman of the Special Olympics for the handicapped), and on women's issues. Both she and her husband support the equal rights amendment, which has been rescinded by the Kentucky legislature. And although both are personally opposed to abortion, they say it is up to the general assembly to decide the issue. Wants to Start a Family Does Mrs. Brown plan to continue her show business career? “Yes,” she replied, as she sat in her office in the Louisville campaign headquarters, “but I'm so happily married, I don't want to be away from John that much. I also want to start a family. But I do have two years left to go on a contract with CBS, and I'm obligated to them.” She said she also plans to do a motivational book for young women for Simon & Schuster, about how a girl from the small town of Denton, Tex., grew up to become Miss America, then the first successful female sportscaster, and, perhaps, the First Lady of Kentucky. “John wants me to do all these things,” she said, “and you can't expect a person like me who's been an achiever to stay in the background. They used to say, ‘Behind every strong man there's a strong woman.’ Well, I like to say, ‘Beside every strong man there's a strong woman.'” The New York Times/Keith Williams John Y. Brown Jr., running for Kentucky Governor, and Phyllis George Brown, left. Mrs. Brown greets a voter, above."
Youth Acquitted as Insane In L.I. Abortion Clinic Fire,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/31/archives/youth-acquitted-as-insane-in-li-abortion-clinic-fire-the-defense.html,"MINEOLA, L.I., Oct. 30 —Peter I. Burkin was found not guilty of attempted murder and arson with intent to kill in the burning of a Bill Baird abortion clinic in Hempstead. L.L. last Feb. 15. The jury, which deliberated six hours In Nassau County Criminal Court, also acquitted the 21‐year‐old defendant by reason of insanity on one count of setting a fire and one count of reckless endangerment. Judge Edward A. Baker handed him over to the State Mental Hygiene Department, which will temporarily commit him to an institution. Mr. Burkin's action has been repudiated by local anti‐abortion groups, which demonstrate outside abortion clinics but say they would never consider setting them on fire. Abortion clinics have been firebombed in other cities. According to Mr. Baird, whose clinic suffered damage estimated at 6100,000, Mr. Burkin's arrest is the only one to have been made in 26 firebombings. The Defense Contentions Mr. Burkin's defense was based on several premises: that he could not be held guilty of attempted murder or arson because he had entered the clinic with a torch to take hostages, not to burn it down; that he was not guilty by reason of insanity, and that he was not guilty by reason of justification ‐ the prevention of what he called the murder of unborn children. Mr. Burkin testified that he had walked into the clinic with a torch to take two hostages, one of whom would remain with him while the other carried a treatise he had written “proving scientifically that abortion is the murder of a being with all the human knowledge of a child about to be born.” The treatise was to be given to the news media and printed. Mr. Burkin and his lawyer, John R. Lewis, were at odds over what part of his not‐guilty plea to emphasize. Mr. Lewis wanted to depend on the insanity aspect and Mr. Burkin wanted to emphasize that he felt justified in preventing what he believed was the murder of unborn children. The defense maintained that the clinic had been burned down accidentally when Mr. Burkin, who was carrying the blazing torch and an uncapped antifreeze can full of gasoline, was caught in a waiting room doorway when the door was slammed by the husband of a nurse who worked there. Mr. Burkin said that he managed to pull his shoulder out of the doorway, caught his foot and fell backwards, spilling gasoline on the floor and dropping the torch. He said he ran from the clinic and tried to put out the flames with snow, then fled. He was caught three blocks away by a policeman. One of the three psychiatrists who testified, Dr. Harold Zolan, said Mr. Burkin had become obsessed with having his treatises brought to the attention of the public and had developed “somewhat of a messianic complex,” but was ignored by newspapers, television stations and antiabortion groups he presented the message to. Dr. Zolan testified Mr. Burkin had told him that he then decided to kidnap a doctor who did abortions and hold him hostage until his treatise was printed by national news media.

FOREIGN AFFAIRS Ireland After The Pope,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/10/31/archives/foreign-affairs-ireland-after-the-pope.html,"ARDMORE, Ireland — Ireland, particularly Roman Catholic Ireland, is busy saving itself by mental exertion from being politically kidnapped, pigeonholed and put on exhibition as the docile good boy at the world's social party ‐ the example to all turbulent advocates of change that the old ways are best. “Ireland faithful, always faithful” were Pope John Paul's parting words as he left for the United States. After some selective listening and wishful thinking about the Pope's many utterances, conservative‐minded Catholics everywhere found some occasion for joy. They were confident that when he said “faithful,” he meant faithful to traditional values, faithful service in the struggle against modernizing tendencies in the church. Father Herbert McCabe, the prominent Catholic preacher and publicist and editor of the magazine Blacldriars, voiced liberal apprehension. He thought the trip to Ireland might be the “booster stage of the trajectory to Chicago”: the televised fervor of the Irish was to be exploited to increase the impact of the Pope's conservatism on the American church. It is dubious whether that was ever the intention. In any case, the Irish since the visit have demonstrated that the Pope's trip certainly was not any kind of soporific opium for the people and that anyone around the world who tried to use Ireland as a happy example of unquestioning acceptance of things as they are is distorting the picture. The visit was no sedative but rather a powerful stimulant to discussion, controversy and audacious speculation. At first hearing, some were aghast, others jubilant at what was taken to be the Pope's stern condemnation of contraception. But the Irish church harbors some of the keenest brains in the country. It did not take them long to point out that the Pope had not condemned contraception but had simply declared that married people must be “open to the gift of children.” The Rev. Desmond Wilson, a prominent Belfast Catholic prelate, noted that from the papal statement can be seen that there has been a considerable shift in teaching “and the condemnation that used to be directed against contraception is now reserved for abortion. It would seem that the struggle against contraception is over.” His Interpretation has been of course questioned. The point is that it is the interpretation that a large percentage of the Irish priesthood, particularly the younger priests, will accept. In Ireland, the sale of contraceptives is prohibited. But women can legally get supplies free from unofficial family‐planning centers or clinics to which they may make voluntary donations. Enthusiasts for old‐time doctrines noted with triumph that the attendance at the clinics had dropped sharply during the visit. They believe that Irish women had seen, in this respect, the error of their contraceptive ways. But the drop in attendance was for the duration only. Attendance is now back to normal. The “papal baby boom” predicted for early next summer, if it in fact occurs, will be the result of a rush of women determined to conceive during the three days of the visit partly for good luck, partly to justify naming the child after the Pope. Just as the majority of Irish Catholics are supposed to regard contraception as simple, which is demonstrably untrue, so they are supposed to have been toughened by the Pope in their hostility to divorce. On this point it is true. There is wider divergency than on the problem of contraception. The other day, the Archbishop of Dublin, Dermot Ryan, was asked whether it was not surprising that at Limerick the Pope supported the continuation of the legal prohibition of divorce when the Irish Catholic Bishops Conference had declared that divorce was simply a matter for the legislature. Archbishop Ryan with all possible flexibility recalled that the Pope had simply been presenting what he believed to be God's understanding of human nature and human relationships. Naturally it is on the political front that the Pope's messages have been most variously and curiously interpreted. Naturally, too, in the first euphoria of his statements in Dublin and Drogheda, the news media, particularly the British press, seized on his denunciations of terrorism as a simple denunciation of the terrorists of the Provisional Irish Republican Army. The Vatican, it seemed, was at last aligning itself with Downing Street. Then everyone looked again and saw that the Pope had laid the blame for the existence of terrorists equally on the shoulders of those governments and institutions that failed to correct the social injustices that were the terrorists’ excuse for their actions. He did not condone terrorism but it was clear from his remarks that he opposed violence and terrorism from above just as strongly as from below. Discussion of this point, too, has been not blunted but finely sharpened by the papal visit. Claud Cockburn, who writes for The Irish Times, a daily published in Dublin, and the British satirical weekly Private Eye, is a guest columnist."
Around the Nation Judge Halts Enforcement Of Illinois Abortion Law,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/02/archives/around-the-nation-judge-halts-enforcement-of-illinois-abortion-law.html,"CHICAGO, Nov. 1 (AP) — A Federal district judge has temporarily halted the enforcement of a new state abortion law just one day after the General Assembly overrode a veto by Gov. James R. Thompson Jr. Judge Joel M. Flaum issued a temporary restraining order yesterday in a class‐action suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union. A separate but similar suit was also filed on behalf of two downstate abortion clinics and three doctors. The new law establishes a broad range of controls over abortions. It prohibits a woman from getting an abortion within 24 hours after being diagnosed as pregnant and requires a doctor to certify that in his judgment the operation is necessary. Heart Patient Rejected For Town‐Paid Transplant STANFORD, Calif., Nov. 1 (AP) —Fireman Fred Kelley, whose Massachusetts hometown voted a special tax to pay for a heart transplant, was rejected for the surgery today as not sick enough to justify the risk of receiving a new heart. “Doctors determined that he does not meet the criteria at this time of receiving a heart transplant,” a spokesman for Stanford University Medical Center said. The spokesman said that Mr. Kelley, who entered the hospital Monday and checked out today, asked him to express his appreciation to the people in his hometown of Framingham. He will remain under a doctor's care at home. At a special town meeting Oct. 10, Framingham citizens voted, 104 to 13, to increase the city tax rate to raise $60,000 for the transplant because his insurance company refused to pay on the ground that the surgery is experimental. Mr. Kelley, 39 years old, suffered two heart attacks in 15 months and doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital told him he had six months to a year to live unless he had a successful heart transplant. 50 Injured in Colorado Crash Of School Bus and Truck OLATHE, Colo., Nov. 1 (AP) — A school bus filled with students collided with a pickup truck today. The authorities said 50 persons were injured. The accident, which destroyed both vehicles, occurred along Colorado Highway 348 about 15 miles from Montrose in western Colorado, a spokesman for the Colorado State Patrol said. It was not immediately known which driver was at fault or how many of the injured persons were students. The students were from kindergarten through high school. Eight persons were in serious condition at Montrose Memorial Hospital. Court Rules Out Barricade Between Whites and Blacks CINCINNATI, Nov. 1 (UPI) — A Federal appeals court refused today to permit white residents of Memphis, Tenn., to barricade a street leading to a black section of the city. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit said that blocking the street would violate the 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which prohibits slavery. “We are convinced,” the court said, “that erection of the physical barrier between a historically all‐white residential neighborhood and a predominantly black neighborhood is precisely the type of ‘badge of slavery’ which was the target of the 13th Amendment.” The 2‐to‐1 decision thwarted a six‐year attempt by residents of Hein Park, a white subdivision, to close West Drive at its north end, where a large black section begins. The city approved the street closing, but black residents went to court complaining that they would be inconvenienced and their property values would fall. Federal District Judge Robert McRae ruled last year that the street could be closed. The appellate court reversed his decision and sided with the black residents."
Catholic Clergy Reject the Idea Of Voting Bloc,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/03/archives/catholic-clergy-reject-the-idea-of-voting-bloc.html,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 2 (UPI) — The nation's Roman Catholic bishops will speak out on a broad range of issues, including abortion, in the 1980 election campaigns, even though the church rejects the idea of “religious voting blocs,” they announced today. The administrative board of the United States Catholic Conference, the bishops’ action arm, issued a 17‐page statement, “Political Responsibility: Choices for the 1980's,” that sets out the church's political role. “We specifically do not seek the formation of a religious voting bloc,” the statement said, “nor do we wish to instruct persons on how they should vote by endorsing candidates.” But the bishops said that they had a right and a responsibility to speak out on issues, particularly those involving “the critical values of human rights and social justice.” “The church recognizes the legitimate autonomy of the Government,” the statement said, “and the right of all, including the church itself, to be heard in the formulation of public policy. Unfortunately, our efforts in this area are sometimes misunderstood.” In 1976, when some members of the hierarchy met with the two major party Presidential candidates, many believed that the church had tacitly endorsed Gerald R. Ford because of his strong stand against abortion. Archbishop Joseph L. Bernardin of Cincinnati, then president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, rejected that interpretation. In the statement today, the bishops warned against single‐issue politics, urging voters to “examine the positions of candidates on the full range of issues as well as the person's integrity, philosophy and performance.” Among the dozen issues singled out for discussion were abortion, arms control, capital punishment, the economy and education. “We wish to point out,” the statement said, “that these issues are not the concerns of Catholics alone; in every case we have joined with others to advocate these positions.” For one thing, the bishops said, society should “reject the death penalty and seek methods of dealing with violent crime which are more consistent with the Gospel vision of respect for life.”"
"Kennedy, at Rally in Buffalo, Asks Carter to Get Tough on Oil Tax Bill",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/04/archives/kennedy-at-rally-in-buffalo-asks-carter-to-get-tough-on-oil-tax.html,"BUFFALO, Nov. 3 — Senator Edward M. Kennedy, broadening his attacks on Administration policies, called on President Carter today to threaten to veto any “windfall” profits tax bill and to reimpose oil price controls unless the tax captured at least half of the new revenues resulting from decontrol. The Massachusetts Democrat, on the brink of formally announcing his Presidential candidacy, chided Mr. Carter for having moved last spring to decontrol oil prices before getting tax legislation passed. He urged the President to get tough with the Senate and the oil companies by making clear that the current Senate version of the windfall tax bill was unacceptable. “I call upon the President today to say to the Congress that he will veto any bill that doesn't provide a return of at least 50 percent of the windfall profits to the general treasury and to the taxpayers of this country,” the Senator told an enthusiastic rally of about 5,000 Democrats here. “That is the kind of message the oil and gas companies will undersand — that he will veto any legislation and that he will reimpose the controls. If he makes that statement, if he makes that condition, I'll tell you, my friends, we'll have a windfall profits tax that will begin to protect the pocketbooks of the taxpayers all across this nation. I think it's time we took this action.” In response, Treasury Secretary G. William Miller issued a statement in Washington recalling that Mr. Carter had originally proposed a tax that probably would have recovered more than half of the oil industry's new profits. Mr. Miller said that the President was satisfied with a House bill and that he expected a Senate committee version “to be strengthened on the Senate floor and ultimately to be enacted in a form close to his proposals.” At the White House, an official derided Mr. Kennedy's proposal as “just absurd” and “basically a political gambit.” With his formal announcement scheduled for next Wednesday, Senator Kennedy worked the crowd like a veteran candidate — out‐talking hecklers, ignoring a few anti‐abortion pickets and a sign about Chappaquiddick, and winning the virtual endorsement of Joseph F. Crangle, the Democratic chairman in Erie County and former New York State chairman. Introducing the Senator, Mr. Crangle, who has backed Mr. Carter so far, recalled the support that Buffalo Democrats gave President Kennedy and Senator Robert F. Kennedy. Finally, gesturing to Mr. Kennedy, he said: “I am sure Erie County will prove a good friend of the next President.” The audience exploded in cheers. Mr. Kennedy, obviously aware of rising consumer complaints about what he called the “outrageous” cost of home heating oil and gasoline, said Mr. Carter had been guilty of “bad economic policy and bad energy policy” by embarking on oil price decontrol in the first place. “It will cost the average American family almost $1,000 a year in the coming decade,” the Senator said, “at a time when the rising cost of energy has already pushed the inflation rate to unprecedented double‐digit levels.” Last spring the President ordered a gradual lifting of the Government's controls on domestic crude oil prices, and proposed a tax on some of the profits to finance a national energy plan. The House passed a bill, roughly comparable to the original Carter proposal, that would tax 57 percent of the “windfall” revenues over the next decade. But Mr. Kennedy maintained that after heavy lobbying by the oil companies, the Senate Finance Committee approved a bill last week that would tax only about 29 percent. Senate Version Irks Carter Mr. Carter has already complained about the Senate version, warning that he might take actions “quite punitive to the oil industry” if he was not satisfied with the final bill. But he has stopped short of threatening a veto or reimposing controls. The rally here and an earlier breakfast meeting were planned to promote the candidacy of Frank J. McGuire, a local businessman, for Erie County Executive. But the Buffalo Convention Center was a scene of Kennedy buttons and huge banners reading, “Win With Ted” and “Kennedy in ‘80,” and the Senator repeatedly drew laughs with jokes about his imminent candidacy. “I didn't come here because New York has 91 electoral votes,” he gibed in an echo of Pope John Paul II, “I came here because I love you.” As the laughter died down, he teased the crowd by asking whether the Buffalo Bills were going to beat the New England Patriots in professional football Sunday. The crowd roared yes, and his eyes twinkled when he replied, “You didn't do it last year.” O'Neill Son Joins Kennedy WASHINGTON, Nov. 3—The Kennedy for President Committee today named Lieut Gov. Thomas P. O'Neill 3d of Massachusetts as its New England coordinator. Mr. O'Neill, son of the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, is to coordinate and advise the Kennedy effort in the New England primaries. “We need a strong hand to guide the economy, and to find solutions to our energy shortage,” the younger Mr. O'Neill said after his appointment. “The profound challenges of this nation are simply not being met.” His father, a longtime political ally of the Senator, has taken a neutral position thus far in the Carter‐Kennedy race.

Design THE PIONEER OF STREAMLINING,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/04/archives/design-the-pioneer-of-streamlining-design.html,"When Raymond Loewy and the century were young, the look of life was different. Everyday objects were bulky, colors were dowdy and machines bristled with ungainly protuberances. Fifty years ago Loewy determined to change all that when he redesigned the Gestetner duplicating machine, encasing its moving parts in a simple shell and mounting it on a graceful base. Modern industrial design was born and, with a handful of colleagues, Loewy founded a profession that today marks every aspect of modern life. “Raymond started industrial design and the streamlined movement,” declares Philip Johnson, the architect. One can hardly open a beer or a soft drink, fix breakfast, board a plane, buy gas, mail a letter or shop for an appliance without encountering a Loewy creation. He is particularly well known for his impact on the look of transportation through his landmark designs for tricycles, motorcycles, automobiles, trains, buses, airplanes and spacecraft. But perhaps even more important are the mundane household Fifty years ago, Raymond Loewy launched the industrial design movement that changed the look of American life. objects that the hand of Loewy touched and changed. The voluminous list includes bathroom scales, record players, electric clocks, refrigerators, radios, toasters, sewing machines, dinnerware, bottles for Coca‐Cola, packaging for Armour and even biscuit shapes for Nabisco, all stripped down to their bare, beautiful basics.  “Simplification first and before everything else,” he states. “Improved appearance is simply a spinoff of simplification.” For four decades of his spectacular career Loewy's launching pad was New York, and he was one of its most celebrated, creative stars. But when he returned to his native France, for both business and personal reasons, he faded from public awareness. Now, as he winds up the fifth decade of his design career, a renewal of interest flurries around him. Two years ago, the Georges Pompidou National Center of Art and Culture in Paris mounted a large exhibition of American industrial design, in which Loewy's early and recent works figured most prominently. Last year he received the Distinguished Achievement Award from the Industrial Designers Society of America, a group which he helped to found in the 1930's. And, on Nov. 20, a handsome book, entitled “Industrial Design Raymond Loewy” as though the two were synonymous, will be published by Overlook Press. Today Loewy is 86 and still the flamboyant, robust figure who was once a familiar sight in the pages of glossy magazines. While he is gradually withdrawing from the day‐today business activities of his Paris‐based organization, Compagnie de l'Esthétique Industrielie, Europe's largest industrial‐design firm, Loewy is still pursuing life with the combination of visionary intuition and Gallic joie de vivre that has been his hallmark for 50 years. In 1975, when the Smithsonian Institution mounted a retrospective of Loewy's designs in Washington, Joshua C. Taylor, the director of the National Collection of Fine Arts, wrote: “Much in this exhibition will seem astonishingly familiar. It may come as a surprise that so much with which we have been surrounded has been the product of one man's vision.” “Educated intuition,” Mr. Loewy says airily, adjusting the gold nuts‐and‐bolts cuff links he favors. A flashy dresser, he often sports windowpane‐checked suits with contrasting striped shirts and polka‐dot socks. He speaks slangy, idiomatic English learned, he says, from Oscar Wilde, Mammy Yokum and the proprietor of a Third Avenue deli. These days he reverts to French when discussing color and emotions, food and wines. Against a background of fast cars, beautiful women and the good life in exotic places, Loewy's career has been enlivened with élan, wit and showmanship. “My early colleagues and myself helped create the life style of Americans,” he states, “and, by osmosis, of the rest of the world.” His own life style trumpeted the message. An avid deep‐sea diver, he once mixed Chanel No. 5 in an air tank because he disliked the smell of oil. An unabashed self‐promotor, Loewy has often been criticized by colleagues as a big show‐off. “1 found it difficult to reconcile success with humility,” he says with candor. “I tried it first but it meant avoiding the very essence of my career — total exhilaration and the ecstasy of creativity.” Challenge continues to excite him. When he was 75, he obtained a racing driver's license at the competition track in Riverside, Calif.; he also took up racing dune buggies, attired in a snazzy outfit festooned with his red rosette of the Legion d'Honneur. “We've always lived lite to the hilt,” Mr. Loewy says. “Money's only value was what we could do with it.” Loewy learned the value of money the hard way. He came to New York precisely 60 years ago with $50 in his pocket. The son of a Viennese economic writer and a woman from the southwest of France, he had a comfortable childhood in Neuilly, an affluent Parisian suburb. In 1908, five years after the Wright brothers’ flight, he designed and built a model plane, powered by twisted rubber bands, that actually flew over 100 yards. “1 was a speed demon ever since I can remember,” he admits. Other children wanted the plane, so Loewy, then 15 years old, took out design patents, registered the trademark Ayrel (based on the French phonetic pronounciation of his initials) and rented space to produce it. “It was a huge success. I learned about employment, sales, bookkeeping and writing manuals in three languages. In two years I knew about business and found it could be fun.” After Loewy's university graduation, he joined the French Army and, one month later, World War I broke out. He had his own breeches custom‐made, finding the Army issue inelegant, and collected several medals along with serious injuries from poison gas. At the war's end, his parents were dead, and he and his brothers were penniless. His brothers migrated to the United States and Loewy soon followed, armed with letters of introduction to Condé Nast, the publisher, and Rodman Wanamaker, owner of the department store. They put Loewy to work as a fashion illustrator and before long he was busy with additional accounts, including Saks and Gimbels. “Financially, 1 was successful but I was intellectually frustrated,” Mr. Loewy recalls. “Prosperity was at its peak but America was turning out mountains of ugly, sleazy junk. I was offended that my adopted country was swamping the world with so much junky looking stuff.” In 1929 Sigmund Gestetner, whom Loewy calls “the duplicating angel,” visited the designer's studio and asked him to give the duplicating machine a new look. Working feverishly, Loewy did what he terms “a face‐lift job” on the duplicating machine and presented the clay model to Gestetner, who manufactured it unchanged for 40 years. But it wasn't until the early 1930's, according to Loewy, that American industrial design was born as a true profession. It was conceived when the Hupp Motor Company engaged Loewy as a consultant on a year‐round basis to improve product design. In 1934 Sears, Roebuck commissioned Loewy to design the Coldspot refrigerator. It was an unprecedented success: The improved appearance dramatically boosted sales. “What I had instinctively believed was being proved by hard sales figures,” Mr. Loewy says. “You take two products with the same function, the same quality and the same price. The better‐looking one will outsell the other.” With characteristic assertiveness, Loewy, who had already designed trash cans for Penn Station, submitted a rendering of an experimental locomotive to the president of the Pennsylvania Railroad. This led to the first welded locomotive and the establishment of Loewy's reputation as the super streamliner. “I've been accused of being a shell designer — you start with a machine and enclose it. But in many cases the shell is essential,” he points out. “A locomotive without a shell would be nonfunctional.” In the late 1930's he also made innovations in department‐store design. “We did the first store without windows, totally controlled by airconditioning.” Later, under William Snaith, Loewy's partner, the firm had a division exclusively concerned with store design for such clients as Bloomingdale's, Macy's, Saks, Penney's, Joseph Magnin, J. L. Hudson, to name a few. As his greatest contribution during the war, Loewy loves to cite his design of a nonmetal lipstick tube; in fact, he also focused his eye on such crucial areas as rocket‐launching vessels and submarine interiors. Loewy's first commission to design packaging and logos came from George Washington Hill, then president of American Tobacco, who, in March 1940, bet Loewy $50,000 that the designer couldn't improve on the existing greenand‐red Lucky Strike cigarette packet. On his desk in Paris, Loewy's paperweight is a plastic bar in which the old cigarette packaging is imbedded alongside his own, now‐familiar white packet with the red target on both sides. Loewy won the bet, and the sales of the cigarette showed a sustained increase. After the war, Loewy traveled to Japan, a trip that “affected my career and my personal life perhaps more than anything,” he declares. “We came upon an enormous platform covered with a simple mat. On either side were tortured cypresses. On the platform were two men in black kimonos playing go. We stayed there for an hour and they hardly moved. Absolute silence and the feeling of purity. I'd never seen aything like it. I rushed back, assembled our 250 designers and gave them a two‐day seminar on Japanese taste — reduction to essentials.” Loewy's flair for publicity and his conviction that such mundane items as bathroom scales and office equipment were worthy of his attention brought a shower of criticism from leading taste makers. “I once accused him of making streamlined pencil sharpeners,” Philip Johnson recalls. “In our fundamentalist view, there was no point in streamlining something that didn't move. Now we appreciate streamlining as a valid movement in American design. And he started it.” “My colleagues made fun of me,” Mr. Loewy smiles. “What they didn't understand is that I tried to minimize maintenance and cleaning and simplify function. Streamlining is reduction to essentials.” This principle was strictly employed in his Studebaker classic, the 1953 Starliner. “I alienated the automotive industry by saying that cars should be lightweight and compact,” Mr. Loewy says. “In those days, they looked like chrome‐plated barges.” He also designed the Avanti for Studebaker in 1981. “On a shoestring in a shack in Palm Springs,” he recalls. “I posted a sign saying, ‘Weight is the Enemy.’ I knew exactly what I wanted. An impression of weightlessness. Slender, down‐sloping front for aerodynamic reasons. Maximum visibility forward, lateral and rear. No grill.” For Avanti II, Loewy redesigned the lights. He still owns two Avantis. In the 1950's he began what became another specialty —trademarks for oil companies. “The correct logo is paramount for sales,” he explains. “It goes on everything — gas stations, tanker trucks, refineries, overalls, oil cans. It must be visible in all climatic conditions — rain, fog, snow.” British Petroleum was the first such client, followed by Shell, then Exxon. His firm's current oil client is the French company Total. For the last two decades, Loewy's major preoccupation has been government assignments. He formed a friendship with John F. Kennedy when he redesigned Air Force One. After the assassination, the Kennedy family asked Loewy to do the memorial stamp. “No one ever designed a stamp without showing the entire head. But we cut the picture off at the top of the head because I thought it symbolized a young man cut off from life.” As the culmination of his career Loewy cites his work for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Skylab, the orbital workshop project, which involved him from 1967 to 1973. “This was by far my most exciting job,” he exclaims. “The psychophysiological comfort and safety of a crew in exotic conditions of zero gravity and subjected to extravehicular activities. My greatest problem was zero gravity. How do you design an interior for it? I felt that a semblance of gravity was essential. The astronauts and scientists all argued against this — they were prepared to sleep floating in space, and to eat that way.” Back in 1967, no one knew anything about living in space, but the project called for three men to inhabit a space capsule for three months. “First, I insisted on a porthole. They must have vision contact with Earth,” Mr. Loewy explains. “On re‐entry they all agreed that without the portholes it would have been awful. Also, their descriptions of Earth from space were so exciting. Second, I insisted that they take meals facing each other, to give a feeling of equality. Then, that they have total privacy for eight hours a day. Finally, I insisted on a surface for sleep because in zero gravity men assume the fetal position, and I felt they should be able to stretch out.” In 1974, George E. Mueller, formerly NASA's associate administrator for space flight, wrote to Loewy: “I do not believe that it would have been possible for the Skylab crews to have lived in relative comfort, excellent spirits, and outstanding efficiency had it not been for your creative design, based on a deep understanding of human needs.” Loewy's organization continues to expand. Christer Rydeberg, the managing director of the French firm, estimates the company has “about 50 active clients,” mostly European. Gestetner is still a client and Lowey still has his first model for the duplicating machine; it is stored in what was the barn at Loewy's country home, Manoir de la Cense, a 16th‐century hunting lodge southwest of Paris, built by Henry IV for his mistress. “Design” is conspicuously absent both at La Cense and his pied‐a‐terre in Paris. Both are cluttered with the objects and photographs of an extraordinary life — Loewy in leather chaps, boots and guns, in an astronaut's suit, in white tie with his wife, Viola, chicly dressed in a draped Dior gown. His offices, however, are slickly white with bold purple carpets. His desk has no drawers and rests on white industrial frames. There are dozens of autographed pictures of world leaders, scale models, mock‐ups and worksin‐progress. “Industrial design in Europe is where it was in the States 25 years ago,” Mr. Loewy declares. Loewy estimates that his firm has employed and often trained some 2,000 young designers. “Young designers are often influenced by fleeting styles,” he notes. “Now I'm trying to keep them from going Art Deco. It's retro, which is bad.” He is glum about young American designers. “They're trying to be too damn intellectual. They're trying to make a pure science of industrial design when it's a simple exercise — a little logic, a little taste and the will to cooperate,” he states. While insisting that he follows no self‐imposed design philosophy, Loewy has, over the past half‐century, developed a few rules. “Design should be simplified but short of aridity. For the masses. Insistence on quality control at all levels. A product that comes on the market must be perfectly tested — the consumer is not the guinea pig. General Motors has recalled hundreds of thousands of cars. This should never happen.” One of the problems, he believes, is that firms now employ their own designers. “Captives,” he snorts. “Following the orders of marketing managers makes them social servants.” Designers should also be free from too many surveys and studies. “The Edsel was a committee car based on market surveys — an abortion and one of the ugliest things ever built.” American cars continue to be objects of his scorn. “Detroit is now headed toward imitating the Mercedes‐Benz — a box on wheels. Look at the width of this door,” he says, pointing to his Avanti. “It's much thinner than an American car door. In this age of fuel shortages you must eliminate weight. Who needs grills? Grills I always associate with sewers. I'd also kill chrome forever, or any other applied junk.” The future of industrial design seems quite clear to him. “It's based on the trend of life — more hectic, more irritating, more complicated. People are bad‐tempered. The markets of the world have been swamped with sleazy stuff that breaks the minute you use it. The role of the industrial designer is to make anything he designs fail‐safe. I'm not talking about esthetics but quality.” Loewy built his career with the conviction that virtually everything can be made more functional. On this point he has mellowed slightly. “Well, maybe there're a couple of things I couldn't improve on,” he admits after some thought. “A champagne bottle and a cigar.” ■"
Minor Party Tries to Prove Itself,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/04/archives/westchester-weekly-minor-party-tries-to-prove-itself.html,"WHITE PLAINS IN its first year as an official political party, the Right to Life Party has about 90 candidates on Tuesday's ballot in Westchestermore than in any other county in the state. “It just worked out that way,” said Mary Jane Tobin, the party's state chairman. “They worked very hard to fill the line.” Through its endorsements in this election, the party hopes to demonstrate to Republicans and Democrats that it is a political force worthy of attention. However, few candidates on the Right to Life line are running with that party's designation alone. The majority have the designation of a major party — in most cases, that of the Republicans. Others also have the line of a second minor party. For example, Joseph W. Christiana, the incumbent in the 13th District, is running on the Republican, Conservative, Liberal and Right to Life Party lines. If he wins by a small margin, all three minor parties can be expected to step forward quickly to claim credit. “I don't think it is going to have a great political effect, because the party is new,” said Andrew P. O'Rourke, Chairman of the Board of Legislators, who is running on the Republican, Conservative and Right to Life lines. “I don't think I've ever lost a vote because I'm on the Conservative line. I don't think the Right to Life as a line is going to hurt either.” Thomas Carty, the new Democratic county chairman, said of the political effect of the Right to Life Party: “I have not addressed myself to it at all. We've been busy with Proposition 1 and other things.” “I believe at this point it would be impossible to project,” said Anthony J. Colavita, the new county Republican chairman, who is running for re‐election as Eastchester Supervisor with the Right to Life designation. Robert D. McKeon, the Right to Life Party chairman in Westchester, says he would like to get 5 percent of the total vote. That would be 2 percent higher than the the Right to Life vote in last year's gubernatorial race, in which the party won 130,000 votes statewide and qualified for a ballot line this time. “I'm not making predictions,” said Polly Rothstein, chairman of the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion. “I hope it's a major failure for them because abortion is not a political issue and should not be a political issue.” Most candidates interviewed agreed that abortion was not a campaign issue. “Nobody's mentioned it to me at all,” said Audrey G. Hochberg, the Scarsdale Democrat and minority leader of the Legislature. In countywide contests, the Right to Life Party is running separate candidates in only three contests — for county clerk and for county legislator in the Second and Fifth Districts, in Ossining and White Plains, repectively. In the Second District, Sandra R. Galef, a Democrat, said that she thought she would lose some votes because of the Right to Life candidacy of Constance A. Palmieri, a lawyer. “I'm going to lose some votes,” especially among the Catholic brothers and sisters at Maryknoll, said Mrs. Galef, whose husband, Steven, now represents the Second District on the board. Mrs. Galef said that she thought Mrs. Palmieri's candidacy would also hurt Carl R. Sandberg, the Republican‐Conservative candidate, because those who might normally vote Conservative would be more likely to oppose abortion and thus support Mrs. Palmieri. But as to how many votes she might get, she said, “That's another question. We'll just have to wait and see.” Mrs. Palmieri said that she had distributed some campaign literature and had met her opponents in three debates. The other legislative candidate running solely on the Right to Life line, Marilyn Joan O'Lear, has not conducted an active campaign because, she said, she has a full‐time job, a health problem and no limited financial resources. She also said that Mr. McKeon had not asked her to campaign actively. “All they want is my name,” she said. “They don't expect me to build up a budget and go out grandstanding.” Mr. McKeon said that he would have preferred to back Michael A. Coffey, the Republican‐Conservative candidate, but that Mr. Coffey had refused the designation. Miss O'Lear was named, Mr. McKeon said, because “the purpose of the party is to run candidates.” Mr. Coffey said that, while he supported the goals of the so‐called rightto‐life movement, “I have trouble in forcing my viewpoints on somebody else.” As for the impact of the party on his race against Carolyn L. Whittle, the Democratic incumbent, he said: “I'd be surprised if they get 200 votes.” Mrs. Whittle, who identified herself as “pro choice,” said that, if anyone would be hurt by Miss O'Lear's candidacy, it would be Mr. Coffey. The Right to Life designation has caused concern in certain judicial races with some candidates contending that the party should have no place in their races, because a judge might have to rule on an abortion‐related question. An endorsement by a singleissue party, they say, could constitute a conflict of interest. Four of the nine candidates for the State Supreme Court from the Ninth Judicial District, which includes Westchester, are running on the party's line. Three of them, according to the State Board of Elections, filed forms declining the Right to Life line, but missed the filing deadline and thus are listed on the ballot as Right to Life candidates, along with their major party designations. Some critics say they do not think the right to life movement should have a political party. A single‐issue party, they say, is detrimental to the twoparty system. Mrs. Rothstein said that she thought it was “a gross distortion of the political system to inject abortion into politics.” George R. Morrow, the incumbent County Clerk who is running on the Republican and Right to Life lines, said that he wished the right‐to‐life movement “had not become part of the political spectrum.” “I think that all groups and individuals can find what they're looking for within the major political parties,” he said. “By having splinter parties you can sometimes damage the political system.” Mr. McKeon maintains that he is using the system to change the system. “This is a very important year for us. We've got to get their attention,” he said, referring to the major parties, to have an influence on next year's races. On the party's “hit list” because of their stand on abortion, he said, were Senator Jacob K. Javits, Representatives Peter A. Peyser and Richard L. Ottinger, State Senators Linda Wirdkow and Mary B. Goodhue, and Assemblymen William B. Finneran, Richard C. Ross and Jon S. Fossel. ■"
Pope and Cardinals Meeting Today On Pressing Problems for Vatican,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/05/archives/pope-anal-cardinals-meeting-today-on-pressing-problems-for-vatican.html,"ROME, Nov. 4 — Roman Catholic cardinals from all over the world are gathering in Rome for an extraordinary assembly, beginning tomorrow, at which Pope John Paul II will give them a report on the state of the church at the end of his first year in office and will ask for their views on the most pressing problems facing the Vatican. The four‐day meeting, which the Vatican calls a “consultation,” has little precedent in the modern history of the church. The fact that it has been called is said by church officials to reflect the new Pope's determination to “do things his own way” even if it means departing from established procedures. The four‐point agenda includes the state of Vatican finances, the nature and role of the Curia, or church bureaucracy, and the Vatican's relations with individual nations, as well as the Pope's report. The agenda was in a letter sent to the cardinals a few days ago by Agostino Cardinal Casaroli, the Vatican Secretary of State. There are 130 cardinals in the Sacred College, but only about 120 are expected to attend. Some are ill, and one cannot come because he was named “in pectore,” that is in secret, last June when the Pope installed 14 other cardinals. The College of Cardinals has not met in such a consultative capacity for at least 100 years, according to church officials. There may have been a meeting in Napoleonic times, an official said. He added that in earlier centuries, when almost all cardinals were Italians, they were frequently summoned to Rome. During one of the conclaves in which John Paul I and John Paul II were elected last year, about 15 cardinals signed a letter asking that the new Pope convoke the College of Cardinals more often. One of the signers, according to informed sources, was Karol Cardinal Wojtyla, who became John Paul II. The existence of the letter became known only recently. Church sources say the Pope may be seeking support from a body that he knows is overwhelmingly favorable to his conservative views on theology, church discipline, divorce, birth control and abortion. The Pope, these sources say, is aware that some of his statements during his visit to the United States provoked criticism inside and outside the church. A resounding endorsement by the cardinals could counteract such criticism by making it clear that his conservative views are predominant in the church as well as the Vatican. The Curia has prepared position papers on all major issues that will be brought before the assembly, officials said. Regarding finances, Vatican experts are said to be alarmed by projections that the already large gap between the costs of church operations and income will widen and may become unbearable. The Pope is expected to call on the wealthy dioceses of the United States and West Germany to step up contributioris to the church's central administration and to stage energetic fund drives. The Curia is understood to have also prepared a study on why a growing number of priests are asking to be released from the priesthood. Pope John Paul has not granted any of these requests. The Curia report is believed to deal less with the human problems of these priests than with the methods by which young seminarians should be screened to exclude those likely to waver later on. On the role of the Curia, Vatican experts point out that Pope John Paul has filled only one major post so far — that of Secretary of State. Cardinal Casaroli was named after the death last March of Jean Cardinal Villot, his predecessor. The cardinals heading each of the nine Sacred Congregations — the departments, or ministries, of the Curia — are the same as under Pope Paul VI. By Vatican rules their tenure expires with the death of a Pope. John Paul I reconfirmed all of them, but John Paul II has neither confirmed them nor indicated that he wants to change them. This, experts point out, gives him an extraordinary hold on many cardinals who have an interest in these posts either for themselves or for associates. Some experts believe that the Pope will name new heads for the congregations soon after his meeting with the cardinals and that he will use the occasion for streamlining the Vatican bureaucracy by reducing the number of the its 3,000 priests and lay workers. There will also be a meeting this week of several thousand superiors of women's orders. Such a conference is held every few years. Among those attending will be Mother Teresa, the nun who won the Nobel Peace Prize last month for her work in the slums of Calcutta."
Books of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/06/archives/books-of-the-times-travels-with-marquez-hints-of-whats-to-come.html,"By grace of the nonpareil translator Gregory Rabassa and the good offices of Harper & Row, we are brought now — after “No One Writes to the Colonel and Other Stories,” “Leaf Storm and Other Stories” and “Innocent Erendira and Other Stories” — to the very suburbs of a masterpiece. From Gabriel Garcia Márquez's “In Evil Hour,” we can see his “One Hundred Years of Solitude,” a “city of mirrors” in the middle of “the most intricate labyrinths of blood.” The prospect dizzies. In the nameless Colombian town of “In Evil Hour” — “the most observant town in the whole apostolic prefecture” — where the afternoon dies “with intense pink clouds and the uproar of parrots and monkeys,” the people dream at night of elephants, of glass cats and “of an oak tree which, instead of flowers, bore razor blades.” They wake in the morning to find “lampoons,” hand‐lettered posters, pasted on their walls and doors. The lampoons are by way of rude advertisements for the guilty self of the town; they retail adultery, abortion, incest, treason and murder. Being the usual compost heap of rumor, the town already knows its own secrets. It is frightened not so much by the information contained in the lampoons as by the stealthy fact of their existence. Who is saying these things out loud, and why? Better that memory should be repressed, as the town tries to repress all that is painful in its imagination and its politics — by little blue tablets and other analgesics, by injections of insulin and applications of pepper cress, by drugs, like Coramine and Luminal, by drinking beer for breakfast and by acquiescence in the torpor at which the damp heat and the jungle rot, the flying ants and the wolfsbane conspire. Father Angel, whose principal business is to decide which movies are “approved for all” to see in the open‐air theater, worries about the lampoons because they represent “a case of terrorism in the moral order.” The mayor of the town, an apparatchik appointed to his post by the latest military coup, seeks to suppress the lampoons, by curfew and torture, because “in the end we have to preserve the principle of authority.” As for the perpetrators, a circus soothsayer — we can't have a Garcia Marquez novel without a circus, especially a circus with a leopard named Aristotle — consults her cards and explains, “It's the whole town and it's nobody.” The lampoons, then, are the pimples of bad faith. Meanwhile, dead mice float in the holy‐water font. As if in sympathy, the river rises, bearing the corpses of a cat and a cow. Houses are moved upland to a graveyard. The “passive Syrians” leave town. The judge disappears. Donkeys die from revolvers exploded in their anuses, and snakes are blamed. A male telegraph operator communicates with his own true love, a female telegraph operator, by Morse code, transmitting poems and entire novels, such as Victor Hugo's “Les Misérables.” We are introduced to chameleons that can't change their colors because they are blind. A certain amount of female hysteria is obligatory. I should say here that “In Evil Hour” suffers somewhat from a comic‐book leftism. García Márquez, on his way from the callow pop‐Modernist finger exercises of his early, deracinated short stories, to the mythic detonations of “One Hundred Years of Solitude,” hasn't yet taught himself to sublimate his politics, nor has he made the empathetic leap that resulted in “The Autumn of the Patriarch.” He sounds less like himself at the end of “In Evil Hour” than he does like the Asturias of the vaporous banana trilogy, Neruda at his tom‐tom in a lapse of lyric verve, or Fuentes in his recent silly third world thriller. In the jungle, in the mountains, guerrillas lurk. Among them are barbers, and dentists and, probably, Emiliano Zapata's white horse. The revolutionary dentist of “In Evil Hour” could in fact have been a compelling character, and it would have been fun to compare him with the lessthan‐revolutionary dentist in Gunter Grass's “Local Anesthetic,” for whom tartar was “calcified hate.” But Dr. Giraldo doesn't dream at all, just as Father Angel amounts to not much more than a pile of impotent good will. And the mayor, who seems at the beginning to be acquainted with some subtlety, is exposed at the end as merely corrupt. We have to settle for mystifications, occasionally brilliant, plus a few grunts and blurbs. Hints of What's to Come There are, though, hints of what's to come. Father Angel remembers the 100‐year‐old curate of Macondo, who played cops and robbers with the children in the main square and who reported to his bishop that “a rain of dead birds was falling in his parish.” And the hotel itself remembers: “Colonel Aureliano Buendía himself on his way to Macondo to draw up the terms of surrender in the last Civil War, had slept on that balcony one night when there weren't any towns for many leagues around. It was the same building then, with wooden walls and a zinc roof, except with no electricity or sanitary services. An old traveling salesman recounted that until the turn of the century there had been a collection of masks hanging in the dining room at the disposal of the customers, and that the masked guests took care of their needs, in the courtyard in full view of everyone.” Genius is limbering up. The 3,000 murdered workers who struck against the banana plantation will be hauled off in the night by silent train. The ants will fly away to devour the last Buendía born as prophesied with the tail of a pig. An hour will turn into 100 years, and the paterfamilias, chained like a goat to a tree in the garden, will mutter in Latin of memory and desire. Sophie Baker Gabriel García Márquez"
Notes on People,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/06/archives/notes-on-people-an-old-hand-is-writing-kennedys-announcement.html,"Richard N. Goodwin first got involved in politics as a speech writer for John F. Kennedy, and he helped shape some of the more important themes of the Administrations of Presidents Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. Now Mr. Goodwin is making his services available to Senator Edward M. Kennedy. In fact, it has been learned that he is the main writer of the announcement, scheduled for tomorrow, in which. Mr. Kennedy finally makes his candidacy for President official. It is not clear who else has been working on the speech, but apparently Mr. Goodwin and other Kennedy staff members have been putting it together in the Senator's house in McLean, Va. For the last several days Mr. Goodwin has been a house guest of Mr. Kennedy, as has his wife, Doris H. Kearns, whose biography of Lyndon B. Johnson brought her considerable attention —and controversy — a few years ago. It is not known whether Miss Kearns also is directly involved in the Kennedy campaign. Confusion Compounded Bil Baird is a well‐known puppeteer with a theater in Greenwich Village. William R. Baird is a well‐known advocate of choice in abortion, with a clinic in Hempstead, L.I. For quite a few years, as a result of his activities, Mr. Baird of Hempstead has received obscene phone calls, even death threats, and every so often misguided callers have directed their attacks at Mr. Baird of the marionettes. In the last few days the crank calls have become more virulent, according to Susanna Baird, wife of the puppeteer. She assumes it has something to do with the recent trial on Long Island of a man charged with setting fire to the Baird abortion clinic. “We've lived with this for many years,” she said yesterday, but added that matters had become so bad that her husband had complained to the police for the first time. Naturally she has a sympathetic ear in Hempstead. “Maybe now people will believe me when I tell them about the hatred I'm getting,” said Mr. Baird there. And yes, he is sometimes confused for the puppeteer. Years ago, he said, he told the other Mr. Baird, “I won't do any puppet shows if you won't help anyone get abortions.” ‘Sad Sack’(Cont.) The sad story of a “Sad Sack” cartoonist who is down on his luck continues, but the latest chapter gives Fred Rhoads something to look forward to. He has just won the right to sue Harvey Publications of New York, which stopped buying his “Sad Sack” comic strip drawings after 24 years. The Arizona Court of Appeals reversed a lower‐court decision earlier this year in which Mr. Rhoads's suit against Harvey was dismissed. He may now sue Harvey for payment of royalties on the cartoons he drew for the company until 1977, when Harvey notified him it needed no more of them and would reprint old strips. Mr. Rhoads then filed for unemployment and Social Security benefits, only to learn he had not been considered an employee by Harvey, but rather a freelance, and was not entitled to those benefits. That led to the suit, in which Mr. Rhoads maintains that if he was regarded as an independent contractor he is entitled to royalties on an estimated 400 million sheets of Sad Sack comics published by Harvey. The cartoonist, who did not create the comic strip, said last week that he had not worked for two years and that “I'm selling my house, it's down to that.” Two Candidates Seeking Mastery in Egg Harbor City Ignored in the political coverage this Election Day is a hot race in Egg Harbor City, a New Jersey town on the Mullica River, about 10 miles south of Atlantic City. There Charlie Mancuso and Joe Wimberg are fighting it out over who will be the next harbormaster. “I won last year, so I have to run again,” said Mr. Mancuso, a Democrat and a retired truck driver. “They had somebody else on the ballot, but she moved to New Zealand,” said Mr. Wimberg, a Republican who is a chemical salesman. “That left it up to me.” Their zeal is all well and good, but it must be noted that its name notwithstanding, Egg Harbor City has no working harbor for anyone to be master of. It used to have one, but that was in the days before railroads. Mr. Wimberg says that if elected he would help his town regain its place as a port by donating his salary so the city could build a ship. “I think you get $25 a year,” he said. “That's what one of the councilmen told me the other day. But I understand the other harbormasters haven't got paid.” Parting Shot The world of quickie literature is filled with books on how to meet people, who the right people are to say hello to, and so on. It was mildly comforting, therefore, to hear about two Canadians, Robert Ramsay and Randall Toye, who felt that not enough attention had been paid to turning one's back on others. Having studied the subject thoroughly, they have produced something called “The Goodbye Book,” a look at how people, in fact and fiction, have dropped or been dropped by lovers, employers, friends and political groups. Of course, the ultimate goodbye is to life itself, and Mr. Ramsay and Mr. Toye have found that while one may never get out of life alive, it is possible to do so with a good line. Consider Oscar Wilde, who looked at the curtains near his deathbed and said, “Either they go or I do.” (He did.) Or Dominique Bonhours, a 19‐century grammarian who gasped as his end drew near: “I am about to, or I am going to, die. Either expression is used.” Clyde Haberman Albin Krebs Associated Press Richard N. Goodwin"
Health Exhibit Booths Offer Diverse Views,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/07/archives/health-exhibit-booths-offer-diverse-views-getting-a-good-response.html,"The 248 exhibit booths now in the public rooms at the New York Hilton Hotel reflect the diverse interests trying to attract the attention of the 12,000 professionals attending the 107th annual meeting there of the American Public Health Association There are, of course, manutacturers who want to sell their wares — everything from contraceptives to office furniture. But there are dozens of booths filled with pleaders for causes — causes that range from rights for homosexuals to rights for women, blacks, Hispanic people and American Indians. In at least one case, on the issue of abortion, there are pro‐and anti‐booths, which have been set up some distance from each other. “It's part of our tradition ‐ we're a progressive organization with regard to human rights and we don't close channels to opposing views,” said Dr. William H. McBeath, the association's executive director as he explained the number of cause groups that rent booths at the annual meetings. ‘Getting a Good Response’ Until last Monday, when one of those groups — the Health Committee Against Racism — increased its activity to a physical attack on Mayor Koch, there had never been any violence, Dr. McBeath said, despite the often close proximiity of sharply differing causes. “I don't recall us ever having to ask anyone to leave,” Dr. McBeath said of the organizations that this year are renting booths for a minimum of $225 for the four‐day meeting that ends tomorrow. Under a banner that read “Gay Public Health Workers Caucus,” Frances Hanckel, a large, cheerful woman wearing a button in her lapel that said “Better Gay Than Grumpy,” sat at a small booth crowded with literature on how to treat homosexual patients. “We're getting a good response,” said Miss Hanckel, who is a hospital administrator in Philadelphia, “but we always have a gay hospitality suite in the hotel for people who are afraid to come up to us in public.” The association pased a resolution in 1975 against any discrimination against homosexuals, but Miss Hanckel said people were still afraid because “they still have to face the real world back home.” Slogan Is ‘Choice’ Not far away, Naomi Calm was manning a booth advocating the right to abortion. “Mostly people who come up are supporters, but we do get some opposition,” Miss Cahn said. “Our slogan is ‘choice',” Miss Calm added, picking up a blue and yellow button with just the word “choice” on it, “and some people come up and say, ‘Did you give the aborted child a choice?’ ” As Miss Cahn was talking, a supporter walked up and pinned on a “choice” button. “The problem is that liberal America doesn't act,” the woman said, citing what she said was the growing strength of the antiabortion movement. The opposition was about a dozen booths away under banners that said “New York State Right to Life” and “Public Health Workers for Life,” groups opposed to abortion. At the booth a continuous filmstrip was running, showing the development of the fetus. “I got interested in 1970 when I saw the results of bad abortions with women coming in bleeding heavily and needing massive transfusions,” said Dr. Ada B. Ryan, who works in the emergency room of Flushing Hospital. “I got furious that we had to use our good blood for their dirty work.” Distillers Draw Snickers Sometimes the commercial exhibitors even seem a little out of place. At a booth set up by a concern called Design Space Interiors, David Frankson, the company's branch sales manager, said: “We're the largest leaser and seller of mobile and modular offices. But I'm probably the only one in the area that doesn't know how to cure my own cold.” Mr. Frankson looked over at a nearby booth where a group was urging women to examine their own bodies for illness. They were offering yellow T‐shirts bearing the legend “I saw my cervix.” Not far away Robert G. Kirk was behind the table at a booth labeled “Discus,” for Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a distillers’ trade group. “We've been making the A.P.H.A. meetings for 20 years,” Mr. Kirk said, “and even though people may drink, they still think it's kind of naughty to drink and there are a lot of wry snickers when neonle walk by.” Anti‐Koch Banner Removed Mr. Kirk was standing in front of a signboard lettered with statements of his group's positions. One of them was: “When taken in moderation by the normal adult, beverage alcohol is not harmful.” “There is a lot of talk this time about the danger of alcohol to pregnant women,” Mr. Kirk said. “Drink in moderation is always our message.” Some of the talk about the dangers of alcohol to pregnant women was coming from the booth of the National Council on Alcoholism. There, Lucy Robe said it is often difficult to get the message across because alcoholics are so frightened. “But we have pamphlets,” Mrs. Robe said, pointing to an array of scaled‐down brochures, “that can easily be tucked into a pocket or purse.” At the booth of the Health Committee Against Racism, Dr. Charles E. Wright, who had been arrested the day before for the attack on Mayor Koch, was back on the job. “The only thing they asked us to do was remove a banner saying ‘Koch is dangerous to your health,’ ” because they felt it was too personal an attack,” Dr. Wright said. One of the largest crowds was gathered around the booth of Edcoa Productions, which makes films for sex therapy. A film with men and women in various states of nudity was being shown. Eva Price, the wife of Edcoa's president, said it was “a desensitizing film, to help people get comfortable with nudity.” To an observer who noted that the booth was drawing a large crowd, Mrs. Price replied, “We always do.” One of the exhibition booths at the 107th annual meeting of the American Public Health Association"

"In the New China, 1 + 1 Can = 4 No More",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/11/archives/in-the-new-china-1-1-can-4no-more.html,"PEKING—Two decades ago, China's most prominent economist, a man named Ma Yinchu, daringly warned that the country's population was expanding too fast and would interfere with economic development plans. For his temerity in going against a Marxist belief that more people mean more production, Mr. Ma was attacked and purged from his job as President of Peking University. But recently, at the age of 98, Mr. Ma was rehabilitated and named honorary President of the school again. For China's leaders now agree he was right all along. Indeed, over the past few months Peking has inaugurated what may be its most important campaign, to reduce China's population growth rate to zero by the year 2000. To achieve this, it has introduced new regulations to limit families to one, or at most two children. Those that comply will receive bonuses and preferential treatment in housing and education for their offspring. Those that do not will have their salaries docked and be promoted more slowly. Given China's vast size, the strong traditional preference for large families and the still overwhelmingly rural makeup of the population — 80 percent work on farms zero population growth is an extraordinarily ambitious target. It is also a critical one. In 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic, China had 540 million people. Today it has 960 million. That is an increase of over 400 million in 30 years, almost double the population of the United States. As a result of this enormous jump, though China's agriculture has made remarkable advances, most Chinese today get no more to eat than they did in the mid‐1950's. There is a severe housing shortage (the average allotment is less than four square yards per person in the cities). Perhaps 20 million people are unemployed. At the same time less than half of all young people can go to senior high school and only 3 or 4 percent to college. All of these problems are likely to be magnified oven the next few years because the children born in the baby boom of the 1950's and 60's are just now coming of age. Half the population is under 21. Nevertheless, the Government appears confident its new measures will be effective in stopping the increase. The immediate goal is to reduce the growth rate from 1.2 percent in 1978 to 1 percent this year, and then to 0.5 percent by 1985. There are several reasons for the Government's optimism. Peking introduced its first significant population restrictions in 1971, after the end of the Cultural Revolution, when the Government began to grasp the dimensions of its population boom. Since then, the growth rate has already been cut from a high of 2.3 percent a year. This success was achieved by several measures: men in the cities were required to wait until they were 27 years old to get married, women until 25. Free contraceptives, abortions and sterilization operations were provided. It is not uncommon in factories or offices to see charts proclaiming the method of birth control being practiced by each worker, with a red star opposite the name of those sterilized. In some factories, women are assigned to monitor the menstrual cycles of their fellow employees, and if a woman who is not supposed to have a child at that time misses her period, she is asked to have an abortion. Americans would be embarrassed to have their friends know such information. But in China, public scrutiny can serve as a weapon. Peking demonstrated its growing confidence on the population question last summer when for the first time since the 1950's it issued what appears to be a relatively ac- curate count of its people (the actual figure was 975.23 mil- lion, which includes 17 million people on Taiwan). The Government did not say what the figure was based on there has been no public reference to a new census — but Chinese demographers have privately disclosed further data on birth and death rates to foreign specialists, sug- gesting Peking does have some basis for its estimate. The tough new policy of trying to limit families to one child, or at most two, now provides the Government with a further way to curb the growth rate. In Peking, a couple that pledges to have only one child will receive a certificate entitling their offspring to preference in everything from entering nursery school, to better medical care, admit- tance to high school and college and later to getting a job. A one‐child family will also get an annual bonus equivalent to $40, equal to a month's salary for an average Chinese worker. From now on, it was announced last week, all families in Peking will be allocated housing space as if they had two children, giving single‐child families an ad- vantage and penalizing those with more than two. Conversely, parents who have more than two children will be taxed 10 percent of their salary, to make them share the state's cost of bringing up their offspring. They will also not be eligible for promotion till the extra child is over 14 years old. The real test of this new policy will come in the coun- tryside, where the birth rate has remained higher. To counter the old economic imperative that more children mean more hands and more income, the Government will grant families with one child a private plot equal in size to that of families with two children. Whether that will really compensate rural families for the lack of more children re- mains to be seen. Traditions die hard. Remote Guizhou Province in the Southwest reported in September that a county Commu- nist Party secretary had his promotion cancelled after his wife gave birth to a sixth child. In Jiangxi Province, a barefoot doctor, or paramedic, was sentenced to two years imprisonment for helping 15 women remove their intra- uterine devices. Whatever the outcome of Peking's new program, the neglect of the past three decades has already left its mark. It took only from 1949 to 1979 for China's population to grow by over 400 million people. But it took until 1840 to reach the first 400 million."
CATHOLICS IN SURVEY BACK SOME ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/11/archives/catholics-in-survey-back-some-abortion-64-agree-on-right-to.html,"64% Agree on Right to Availability as Do 69% of Protestants —40% Back Female Clergy American Roman Catholics support the availability of abortion at a percentage only slightly lower than among Protestants, according to the most recent New York Times/CBS News Poll. But a plurality in both religions would disapprove of an acquaintance having an abortion. The nearly identical attitudes have been suggested in several previous sur- veys, despite the leadership of the Catho- lic Church in the cross‐denominational campaign against abortion. The same poll also showed that 50 per- cent of the Protestants favored women as clergy and 40 percent of the Catholics did. However, the percentage of Catholics opposed to women in the clergy has jumped from 45 to 55 percent in two years, perhaps a response of previously undecided people to the views of Pope John Paul II during his trip to the United States three weeks before the latest poll was taken. Because the Pope's visit and his views were not mentioned in the telephone in- terviewing of 1,385 voting‐age Americans from Oct. 29 to Nov. 3, it is impossible to know how much his stands against abor- tion and the ordination of women affected people's attitudes. But in the two years since the last Times/CBS News Poll on these subjects, there has been a minor slippage of sup- port for abortion that may not have statistical significance. Catholic support for female clergy remains nearly the same. Held No ‘Catholic’ Issue The continuing similarity of the views held by Protestants and Catholics on abortion, both positive and negative, sup- ports the belief of many that opposition to abortion is not a “Catholic” issue but, rather, a broad‐based attitude of reli- gious and nonreligious people. Orthodox Jewish leaders and some fundamentalist Protestants have been as strong as the Catholic Church in condemning abortion. A recent study by Dr. Judith Blake, a sociologist at the University of California at Los Angeles, asserted that regular church attendance, far more than age, race, sex, income, community or denomi- nation, was the common factor among abortion opponents. The current Times/CBS News Poll asked for a response to the statement, The right of a woman to have an abor- tion should be left entirely to the woman and her doctor.” Sixty‐nine percent of the Protestants agreed, as did 64 percent of the Catholics. Twenty‐seven percent of the Protestants disagreed as did 32 percent of the Catho- lics. Four percent of each religion could not decide. No figure was given for Jews because they constitute only 3 percent of the popu- lation and, in such a survey, their per- centages would be considered statisti- cally insignificant. Slippage in 2 Years The same question was asked by the Times/CBS News Poll in October 1977, when 69 percent of the Catholics agreed with the pro‐abortion statement. A second question in the current poll also dealt with abortion. People answer- ing the random telephone calls were asked, “Would you approve or disap- prove of someone you know having an abortion?” Thirty‐two percent of the Protestants approved, as did 27 percent of the Catho- lics. Thirty‐nine percent of the Protes- tants disapproved, and so did 44 percent of the Catholics. For both religions, 25 percent answered, “It depends.” These figures were nearly identical to attitudes expressed in a September 1978 poll sponsored by CBS News. The third question in the current poll was, “Do you think women should be ministers, priests and rabbis?” Fifty percent of the Protestants said yes and 40 percent of the Catholics did so. Forty‐one percent of the Protestants said no, as did 55 percent of the Catholics. No separate figures were provided for Jews, but the responses of all “non‐Catholics” (including Protestants) were the same as for Protestants alone. Figures 2 Years Ago These figures contrasted with a Janu- ary 1977 CBS poll in which 50 percent of non‐Catholics and 42 percent of Catholics favored women as clergy while 34 percent of non‐Catholics and 45 percent of Catho- lics opposed the idea. The difference in the two polls is a drop in undecided Catholics from 13 percent to 5. This could be attributed to the Pope's statements in his trip from Oct. 1 to 7. A Gallup Poll earlier this year showed that 40 percent of American Catholics fa- vored women's ordination, compared with 36 percent in 1977 and 29 percent five years ago. That survey also found a de- cline in “strong opposition” from 47 per- cent in 1974 to 43 percent in 1977 to 36 per- cent in 1979. Officials of the Women's Ordination Conference, a Catholic group, have pre- dicted that support will go over 50 percent in the 1980's. The lines have become hard- ened by the Pope's unwavering rejection of women as priests and by the public suggestion of Sister Mary Theresa Kane, a leader of American nuns, that women be considered for all ministries. While some Catholics have strongly criticized Sister Theresa, Archbishop James V. Casey of Denver recently called her statement “reverent, kind and lov- ing.” He indicated that he might name women as “directors of Christian com- munities” in remote Colorado villages where no Driest is available."
Chrysler: A Republican's Dilemma,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/11/archives/chrysler-a-republicans-dilemma.html,"WASHINGTON — “It's all very frustrating sometimes,” said Senator Jake Garn, the Republican who at the moment has more to say about the fate of the Chrysler Corporation than any other in the Senate. “Nobody up here seems to care about the facts! All that many of my colleagues care about is how they're perceived! It's all perceptions, no facts!” A few facts: Jake Garn is a native of Utah — the senior Senator from his state. Age 47, he is a former insurance executive, ex‐Mayor of Salt Lake City, and a former Navy pilot. A Mormon, the Senator neither smokes nor drinks. Elected to the Senate in 1974, Mr. Garn is Secretary of the Senate Republican Conference, ranking member of the Banking Committee and serves on the Appropriations Committee (its defense subcommittee) and on the Select Committee on Intelligence. He loves family (he has six children through two marriages), photography (his office is lined with his own photos of Washington and the Capitol) and, according to his aides, plays a mean game of table tennis. In terms of perception, Mr. Garn is seen as one of the most articulate and thoughtful members of a growing block of conservatives who have garnered a surprising degree of what the Atlantic magazine recently called “raw power” in the Senate. His conservative credentials are impeccable: he was an early leader of the Senate forces opposed to the SALT treaty with the Russians; he is opposed to Federallyfunded abortion; he favors increased military spending, opposes many social welfare programs, and has voted against labor reform measures. On the basis of both facts and perception, Jake Garn would seem to be the ideal politician to rally opposition to the $1.5 billion loan guarantee package recently proposed by the Administration to rescue the nearbankrupt Chrysler Corporation. Mr. Garn, however, has so far ceded his opposition leadership role to Senator William Proxmire, Democrat of Wisconsin and chairman of the Banking Committee, whose resounding blasts at the Government's proposed “bailout” have sent shivers through Detroit boardrooms. Why has Senator Garn demurred in what seems to be such an obvious question of principle? “There's no doubt that I'm philosophically opposed to this bailout, but I've really just begun to study the facts of the Chrysler request,” Mr. Garn said. He admits that his philosophical opposi- The New York Times/George Tames Senator Jake Garn tion is deep seated: Government, he believes, should not be in the business of propping up failing businesses. Government aid to the private sector inevitably leads to control of private enterprises by the public sector, he argues. The right to fail, he said, is an important part of the free enterprise system: It leads to the efficient use of capital, labor, and productive facilities. Putting ideology aside, however, Senator Garn said he has “deep concerns” about the impact on employment and the national economy of a shutdown or bankruptcy of the nation's 10th largest industrial corporation. Will it severely affect growth? How would it affect the nation's trade balance? Finally, he is concerned about two additional factors: the extent to which Chrysler's problems have been caused, or exacerbated, by overly burdensome Government regulations; and the potential cost to taxpayers of a bailout versus the actual cost of a prospective Chrysler bankruptcy. While Senator Garn says he supports the fuel emission, efficiency, and safety regulations, he adds that he is convinced they have exacerbated Chrysler's financial condition and says he favors an extension of their deadlines. The compliance costs, however, have generally been downplayed by the Administration and many in Congress as an important factor in the discussion of Chrysler's difficulties and why assistance is justified. The cost of a Chrysler bankruptcy to taxpayers is the Administration's major weapon in support of the guarantees: The Treasury Department has estimated that a Chrysler shutdown would cost $2.75 billion in 1980 and 1981 in lost revenues and added welfare costs, and result in the loss of up to 100,000. jobs. And although industry analysts argue that a voluntary reorganization of the company under the bankruptcy laws would not necessarily lead to a shutdown of Chrysler operations, as the Administration has claimed, the possibility of a shutdown deeply concerns Senator Garn and other Republicans despite their philosophical opposition to a bailout. “If I could be assured that Chrysler would remain viable if we approve the aid, and that it wouldn't cost the taxpayers anything, I think the risk might be worth taking,” Mr. Garn said. His aides, however, doubt that the Administration would be able to convince the skeptical Senator that Chrysler can survive and therefore should have his support. He said in an interview that he would have voted against the $250 million Lockheed bailout in 1971, even though the survival of a major defense contractor was at stake. And Administration cajolings could not persuade him to support the $1.6 billion loan guarantee package for New York City. With respect to Chrysler, Senator Garn said: “I guess I don't think that this issue will be decided on ideology or even by partisan politics.” The aid question must be decided, he believes, on the facts and on the merits. Both the company and the Administration, he said, have not provided enough facts to back up their assumptions about Chrysler's survival prospects. The process will probably begin in the Senate in earnest this week, when the Banking Committee opens hearings on the Chrysler aid legislation. Mr. Garn intends to make sure that the Administration has all the answers to the 18 pages of questions he and Senator Proxmire posed in a letter to Mr. Miller two weeks ago. “I'm a realistic conservative, and this request must be decided on the merits,” he said."
WOMEN COMPARING CARTER AND RIVALS,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/11/archives/women-comparing-carter-and-rivals-some-groups-say-president-has-not.html,"Now that the two major challengers to President Carter for the Democratic Presidential nomination have formally announced their candidacies, women's groups around the country, like other organized interests, are scrutinizing the candidates’ records as the wary courtship dance between candidates and potential supporters begins in earnest. Comparing the records of President Carter, Senator Edward M. Kennedy and Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. is difficult, many feminist leaders acknowledge, because their political contexts and therefore their powers are so different. Mr. Kennedy has a 17‐year history as a Massachusetts Senator on which to base judgments, while Mr. Brown has been Governor of California for five years. Mr. Carter, a former Governor of Georgia, is serving his third year as President. Nevertheless, while the contenders’ stances are similar on some issues, clear distinctions emerge on others. The passage of the proposed equal rights amendment is among the top priorities of the feminist movement, and although all three men support the proposed amendment, many feminists fault Mr. Carter for not being more of an activist on the issue. “There are not many specific things we've asked that the President hasn't done, but I think there are a lot of things he could have done that have not been done,” said Suone Cotner, executive director of E.R.A. America. Doubts He Used Power According to Iris Mitgang, chairman of the National Women's Political Caucus: “There is a general sense in the women's movement that if anyone could deliver the E.R.A., it was a President from the South, and I don't think Mr. Carter has used the full power of his Presidency for us. But if in the next few months we get another state or two because of him, or woman on the Supreme Court, we're going to have to listen to him.” Mr. Carter, Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Brown all supported the extension of the deadline for ratification of the amendment. On abortion, the differences are more pronounced. Mr. Carter is personally opposed to abortion, and has gone on record as opposing Medicaid financing of abortions for low‐income women. While Mr. Kennedy says he is against unrestricted abortion, he has supported Medicaid financing. Mr. Brown has not only supported such financing but he has also authorized state funds to pay for such abortions. Karen Mulhauser, executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League, said: ‘I would put Kennedy and Brown close together as being supportive of legal abortion and of funding for lowincome women, but I would give Carter very low grade because of his opposition to that funding.” Appointments on Record Both Mr. Carter and Mr. Brown point to their records on appointing women to office. Twenty‐three percent of all Presidential appointments to Government positions have gone to women during the Carter Administration, as compared with 12.9 percent under PreSident Ford, previously the highest percentage. Among female judges, of the 23 women now serving on the Federal bench, 19 were Carter nominees. Of the five female Cabinet Secretaries in the history of the United States, two are Carter Cabinet members, and the President has just nominated a third, Judge Shirley Hufstedler, as Secretary of Education. There have been 25 female ambassadors in the nation's history, of whom 10 are Carter appointees. Within his sphere of influence, Governor Brown has done even more, according to many feminist activists. He has appointed more than 1,000 women to various positions, a figure that represents about 30 percent of all his appointments. He named a woman, Rose Bird, as Chief Justice of the California Supreme Court. Three of the seven Cabinet secretaries in his administration are women; of the 40 major departments in the state government, 10 are headed by women. As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Kennedy has advocated the appointment of more women as Federal judges, and has proposed such candidates as Rya Zobel, who was confirmed and is now a sitting judge in Massachusetts. Find Few Women on Staffs However, many feminist leaders say that while all three Democrats proclaim their support for more women in such positions, they fail to one degree or another to apply such standards to their personal staffs. Mr. Kennedy's Senate staff has been dominated by men, with no women in high‐level positions; Kennedy advisers are promising an improvement in the campaign staff, which is being assembled. Mr. Carter is also criticized by feminists for excluding women from his inner circle of policy‐makers. On Mr. Brown's staff, three of the seven senior positions are filled by women; the posts are those of legislative secretary, press secretary and appointments secretary. Assessing the performance of the three Democrats on this score, Mrs. Mitgang concluded: “None of them are terrific in this area. I always have concerns about candidates’ real commitment to women when they have no women close to them in policy‐making positions.” Many women's rights advocates are holding back now, hoping to increase their leverage. “Any candidate will say, ‘I'm for women,’ “ said Bella S. Abzug, who was dismissed by President Carter this year as co‐chairman of the National Advisory Committee for Women. “The new test for candidates should be what they actually do during a campaign, not what they say. We can no longer rely on words.”"
Klan Killings Last Weekend Were Not the Only Example of Violence,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/11/archives/free-speech-and-provocation-can-be-hard-to-separate.html,"The late Hugo L. Black believed in freedom of speech as deeply as anyone who ever sat on the United States Supreme Court. Soapbox orators, pickets, Communist Party leaders — in his view all were protected by the First Amendment. But 10 years ago, in a case involving civil rights demonstrators and a hostile crowd, he wrote: “When groups with diametrically opposed, deep‐seated views are permitted to air their emotional grievances, side-by-side on city streets, tranquillity and order cannot be maintained even by. .. the finest and best [police] officers.” Last weekend a clash between two groups with violently opposed views brought tragedy in Greensboro, N.C., when five members of the Communist Workers Party, U.S.A. died after being shot while demonstrating against the Ku Klux Klan. During the last few days there was another test of First Amendment limits in tense situations. Anti‐Shah marches by Iranian students in this country brought angry and sometimes violent reactions from Americans frustrated by the seizure of the embassy in Teheran. The Greensboro incident was not exactly a classic test of political freedom. There'was cold‐blooded via lence in it. But in the events leading up to the disaster there were elements of what could be called the politics of provocation, a phenomenon that seems to be growing and that raises troubling social as well as legal questions. The Communist Workers Party distributed fliers calling Klan members “treacherous scum elements” and “racist cowards” and challenging them to attend their rally. When Klansmen arrived and shouted epithets at the demonstrators, they pounded on the cars and chanted “Death to the Klan.” Witnesses say Klansmen then fired. The limit on speech when it arouses a hostile reaction is an issue long debated in the Supreme Court. As long ago as 1940 the Court reversed the conviction of a Jehovah's Witness for breach of the peace when he spoke against the Roman Catholic Church on a Connecticut street. He was offensive, the Court said, and some listeners were angry. But he did not “resort to epithets or personal abuse.” In a case shortly afterward the Court made clear that the First Amendment did not protect “fighting words” — terms of abuse that by their very utterance tend to incite violence. In 1951 the Court upheld the conviction of a Syracuse, N.Y., student for disorderly conduct when he went on with a left‐wing speech after the crowd be- came hostile and the police warned him to stop. But Justice Black dissented, saying that the first duty of the police was to protect the unpopular speaker. His view may have prevailed when in 1963 the Court reversed the breach-of-peace convictions of 187 black students in South Carolina who demonstrated against racial discrimination and refused police orders to disperse after a hostile crowd gathered. The judicial trend in recent years seems to have been toward allowing unpopular, even provocative speakers more leeway in situations of conflict, putting the responsibility on the police to protect them. This goes along with a broader movement, both legal and political, toward freer expression of ideas, however extreme. Fifty years ago people were successfully prosecuted for advocating radical ideas, however academically — pacifism, for example, or Communism. It was those cases that drew from Justices Holmes and Brandeis dissents using such phrases as “freedom for the thought that we hate.” Today that battle has been won. No idea is too hateful to be expressed under the First Amendment, not even Nazi doctrine in Skokie, Ill. The possibility of restraining political speech arises only in a tinderbox setting. As the expression of unpopular ideas has acquired greater constitutional protc‐ction, the volume and vigor of political expression seems to have grown. The civil rights movement saw the rise of mass demonstrations as a technique of moral‐political persuasion. Then protests of various kinds -- speech in dramatized forms-played a critical part in the politics of opposition to the Vietnam War. Nowadays free political speech in the United States includes a multitude of sharp tongues: extremist sects of right and left, single‐issue zealots, racial blocs. No important political occasion is without its pickets and shouters. When Senator Edward M. Kennedy announced his Presidential candidacy in Boston last week, abortion opponents marched outside. It may have been a sense of general nastiness in political life that led Senator Howard H. Baker Jr., when he announced, to say it was time “to recivilize politics in the United States.” In truth, American politics has always had its nasty side, its brutality of language. Jefferson was excoriated by opposition newspapers as a viper. Lincoln fared no better. There may be something different in the atmosphere today, the menacing sense that not only words are involved, that physical pressure or violence may also be near. Not so long ago three American leaders were killed by people who may have been trying to score some tortured ideological point. That fact cannot be far from the mind of anyone who sees political speech turning into a kind of assault, or becoming so provocative that it may arouse violence. “The constitutional right of free expression is powerful medicine in a society as diverse and populist as ours..., Justice John Marshall Harlan wrote in 1971. “To many, the immediate consequence of this freedom may often appear to be only verbal tumult, discord and even offensive utterance. These are, however, within established limits, in truth necessary side effects of the broader enduring values which the process of open debate permits us to achieve. That the air may at times seem filled with verbal cacaphony is, in this sense, not a sign of weakness but of strength.” That is the American constitutional theory. But there still are “established limits.” The problem is for judges and policemen and citizens to find and apply them in a turbulent society. ©Greemboro Daily News via United Press International A wounded anti‐Klan demonstrator in Greensboro, N.C. is watched over by an armed friend."
The Nation's Voters Seemed Reluctant to Make Changes,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/11/archives/the-nations-voters-seemed-reluctant-to-make-changes-birmingham.html,"Nearly a third of the nation's big cities elected mayors last week, two states chose governors, and voters disposed of propositions from school‐busing limits in California (ap- proved) to repeal of Maine's bottle law (rejected). If one conclusion can be drawn from these scattered off‐year elections, it is that voters were not in the mood for great change. On issues, they tended to be conservative. On candidates, they generally stuck either with the incum- bent or someone from the same party, leaving the Demo- cratic‐Republican balance of power little changed. Cleveland proved an exception. Dennis J. Kucinich was voted out after two angry years as Mayor, losing badly to Ohio's Lieut. Gov. George V. Voinovich. But Mr. Kuci- nich is a renegade Democrat, disowned by his own party. And Mr. Voinovich, although more acceptable to bankers and state officials whose help is needed to restructure city finances, is not a standard‐issue Republican. Like Mr. Kucinich, he opposes sale of the publicly‐owned electric company. The main difference, one observer quipped, may be that “George says please and thank you.” Republican hopes of resurgence failed to materialize in the two gubernatorial races. In Kentucky, Democrat John Y. Brown Jr. defeated former Gov. Louie B. Nunn, who had run a hard‐nosed personal campaign. In Missis- sippi, former Lieut. Gov. William Winter ended Gil Carmi- chael's dream of being the first Republican governor since Reconstruction. Democratic incumbent mayors were re‐elected in Boston (Kevin H. White becoming the first man to win four consecutive terms), Baltimore, Miami, Salt Lake City and Toledo. Republican incumbents won in Indianapolis and Phoenix, while the election in Houston went to a runoff. Below are reports on other races of more than passing in- terest, either because of the issues or candidates involved. Birmingham: Blacks Are Senior Partners By HOWELL RAINES BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — The election of Richard Arrington as Mayor of this city points up a fundamental shift within the biracial political coalitions that emerged from the civil rights movement. Those coalitions transformed Southern politics in the course of only 15 years. But when important offices were at stake, blacks were almost always the junior partners. They provided the votes; the offices went to the whites. Mr. Arrington, however, is the son of sharecroppers, and his election as first black Mayor of a town once ruled by Bull Connor follows a trend in Southern cities. Here, and in Atlanta, New Orleans and Richmond, blacks have become the beneficiaries, rather than merely the organizers. Alas, the circumstances of the Arrington victory on Oct. 30 also illustrate such coalitions’ fragile nature. Few civic leaders cheered the campaign waged against Mr. Arrington by Frank Parsons, who regaled audiences with stories such as that of a 90-year-old woman who, having narrowly escaped a rape attempt, vowed to crawl on her knees to vote for him. Such tactics won Mr. Parsons 90 percent of the white vote but, some observors believe, polarized the black vote against him. Polarization, of course, works both ways. The Voter Education Project has found that only about 10 to 15 percent of white voters will support black candidates under the best of circumstances. For now, black candidates must depend on white crossovers, just as liberal white candidates needed black crossover votes 10 years ago. The troubling prospect is that the next step in Southern cities, many of which are at or near parity in racial population, will be showdown voting between blacks and whites. The biracial coalitions in Southern cities are not the populist, working‐class unions that civil rights leaders hoped for. The black masses and the white elite — academics, professionals, and the Chamber of Commerce crowd who believe a black Mayor helps Birmingham's reputation — put Mr. Arrington in office. The same pattern is emerging in Thursday's election in Memphis, where the incumbent Mayor, Wyeth Chandler, has veered to the right in his campaign against W. Otis Higgs Jr., a black judge. In the Presidential campaign, the Republicans, who have long courted disaffected white Southerners, would benefit from any lasting racial split. Democrats face a trickier situation. Mr. Arrington's election, for example, replaces a mayor loyal to President Carter with one who says he is uncommitted. But if Senator Edward M. Kennedy is to capitalize on that, he must win black support without alienating blue‐collar Democrats. In a city where race influenced both the issues and the arithmetic of the election, that may take a fine calculation. Philadelphia: Still On the Party Line By ALAN RICHMAN PHILADELPHIA — When William J. Green was elected head of the Democratic City Committee in 1967, he got the job on the unanimous approval of 63 Democratic ward leaders. When he lost the job in 1969, it was because his reformist tendencies displeased one man, Democratic Mayor James H. J. Tate. Philadelphia, as Frank Rizzo demonstrated, is the home of the emperor‐mayor. The man in office has the power to sign contracts, and to make appointments to key boards, without City Council approval. Mr. Green last week became Mayor‐elect, having campaigned successfully on the promise that he would bring together the ethnic factions of the city. Politicians with an eye to 1980 are waiting to see whether he can also bring together the local factions of the Democratic Party. In recent years, advances by the civil service system, court decisions against patronage, and independent stands by successful candidates have weakened political machines everywhere. But the mayors of a few big cities retain the clout — or at least the potential clout — to influence sizable blocs of Democratic votes. Chicago's Mayor Jane M. Byrne, after beating the “machine” incumbent in a primary on her own way to victory last year, did not so much junk the old apparatus as retune it. She has now put its power behind Senator Edward M. Kennedy, and that is no small favor. It is not yet certain that Mr. Green, a Kennedy friend, can render similar service. But Democrats believe he will at least be more of an asset to the party than the departing Mayor Rizzo, who frequently supported Republican candidates and alienated black voters. William A. Meehan, head of the Republican Party in Philadelphia, notes that the days are gone when a mayor could ensure votes by providing jobs. There are, he says, “probably only 50 divisions out of 1,790 in the whole city where the vote is actually controlled.” Nevertheless, the Democrats hold a 7‐2 registration edge, and there are other forms of leverage. At the moment, virtually all the Democratic factions have been noticeably warmed by Mr. Green's conciliatory attitude. Democratic City Council members, although most owe him no particular loyalty, have no reason to oppose Mr. Green — and, given the powers of his office, plenty of reason to cooperate. The potential of Mr. Green's power was acknowledged by Senator Kennedy on a recent visit. Smiling, he said he certainly hadn't come to Philadelphia because Mr. Green would have a great deal of control over 168 convention delegates and 27 electoral votes. “I'm here because I love Billy Green,” he said. San Francisco: ‘No’ To the Old Liberalism By WALLACE TURNER SAN FRANCISCO — Politicians trying to gauge the mood of the country could do worse than to study the fate of ballot questions in this most liberal of California cities last week. Voters rejected propositions to set up rent control, to limit high‐rise construction, to abolish the police vice squad, to tax business more heavily and to provide binding arbitration of wage and working‐conditions disputes with the police and fire unions. The “no” vote on compulsory arbitration — especially when it is considered alongside statewide approval of a constitutional amendment limiting budget growth — may provide the best local illustration of a growing phenomenon. The outcome reflected fears of inflation and recession, and apprehension over steady increases in the cost of Government services. And equally significant, it reflected a hard‐nosed attitude, seen in New Orleans and other major cities this year, toward the demands of organized municipal labor. In this case, voter sentiment was clearer on issues than personalities. In the mayoral race, for example, nei- ther Mayor Dianne Feinstein nor Supervisor Quentin Kopp won enough votes to avoid a runoff election Dec. 11. Police and fire salaries in San Francisco have been set since 1975 as the average of those in California cities with populations over 350,000. Pressure for raises is thus point- less. But with binding arbitration, the unions would stand a chance of making gains (the current pay for police and firemen make $18,916 annually to start, $21,866 after four years). In its essentials — how to break out of the corral and get more — this is the same difficulty faced in post-Propo- sition 13 California by all public‐employee unions. There is not enough money after the property‐tax cuts imposed last year. Cities, counties and school districts can show the union negotiators bare cupboards, and defy them to figure out where money for raises would come from. The crunch has led to a rash of strikes, unsuccessful demands for binding arbitration as a way out, and more often than not, no real gain for the workers. For example, when the San Francisco Federation of Teachers ended a strike last month, leaders said they had gained $2.2 million more than had been offered. The fact is, that money was what the school district saved by not paying teachers dur- ing the strike. Public employee unionism got a foothold here in 1971, when the state passed a law providing for consultation be- tween public officials and employee organizations. In 1977, true collective bargaining rights were provided. Now, just two years later, the message from liberal San Francisco may be that taxpayers are determined to avoid higher taxes to support higher wages for public workers. Minneapolis: Hope For Humphrey's Heirs By NATHANIEL SHEPPARD Jr. MINNEAPOLIS — Donald M. Fraser's easy victory in the mayoral election here last week gave new hope to Minnesota liberals, still smarting from the loss of state and Congressional seats in a Republican sweep in 1978. Despite a blitz by the same anti‐abortion forces that helped engineer his primary defeat in the United States Senate race last year, Mr. Fraser won by a 2‐1 margin over Charles Stenvig, a Conservative Independent and former police detective who has been Mayor twice in the past. It would appear that the Democratic Farm Labor party, the power base of Vice President Mondale and the late Hubert H. Humphrey, had regained the lead in what is surely one of the more clearly defined and protracted liberal‐conservative struggles in the country. Some observers, in fact, concluded that the anti‐abortion tactics that worked so successfully last year against Mr. Fraser, former Gov. Rudy Perpich and others had backfired. It can also be argued, however, that the Minneapolis race was not a true test for the anti‐abortion movement, whose strength has been demonstrated not only in Minnesota but also in Iowa, New York, Massachusetts and elsewhere. For one thing, abortion was not an issue in the city election until “right-to-life” organizers decided late in the game to make it one. In the field of five candidates only Mr. Stenvig alluded to the abortion question, using the phrase “I am pro‐life” in his campaign literature. Furthermore, it is difficult to say how much Mr. Stenvig's candidacy was affected by controversy over political influence in the Police Department — an issue reflected in a separate ballot proposal, approved by the voters, to curb the Mayor's patronage power in appointing police chiefs. What the election did provide was additional proof of a “single‐issue” group's ability to choose its targets and strike quickly. For example, on Nov. 2, less than a week before the election, city neighborhoods were flooded with copies of a “Dear Friend” letter from Alvin Palmquist, a policeman and minister who gained headlines for his efforts to combat teenage prostitution. The letter asked voters to support Mr. Stenvig, and attacked Mr. Fraser for voting “for tax aid for abortion” in Congress and “against every bill that would aid law enforcement.” Then, two days before the election and too late to allow for a strong response, The Committee For Truth About Fetal Research distributed pamphlets at churches throughout the city accusing Mr. Fraser of “voting against” efforts to stop funding of research on fetuses. The pamphlets pictured a developed fetus in a large container which had wires attached to it. A man standing next to the container was described as a doctor “engaged in fetal research.” Associated Press; United Press International Cleveland Mayor Dennis J. Kucinich (left), Donald M.

News Summary; International,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/13/archives/news-summary-international.html,"TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 1979 All oil imports from Iran were halted under an order by President Carter, who said that Washington would not yield to “unacceptable demands” for the return of the deposed Shah made by Iranians holding Americans hostage in the Embassy in Teheran. Appearing on television, Mr. Carter urged Americans to “redouble” efforts to conserve energy. [Page A1, Column 6.] Relatively little impact on oil supply is likely to result from the halt in imports of Iranian petroleum to the United States, according to Administration and private analysts. About 4 percent of America's consumption that has come from Iran can probably be replaced by oil from other countries, they said, and, although costs are likely to rise, the increases are expected to be ,comparatively small. [A1 :3.] The Shah must be surrendered to Iran, according to a top Iranian official, who instructed foreign diplomats to stress that message to Washington. He also said that Washington must also surrender the Shah's wealth to regain American hostages in Teheran. [A1 :4‐5.] The P.L.O. has given up efforts to gain the release of the American hostages in Teheran, according to Palestinian sources. They said that the mission had foundered because of Iran's insistence that there was no point in talking Washington would not surrender the deposed Shah. [A8:2‐5.] Nearly 250,000 people were evacuated after the derailment of a train loaded with toxic chemicals in the Toronto suburb of Mississauga. Firemen wearing gas masks pumped 5,000 gallons of water a minute on the flaming wreckage of a 106‐car Canadian Pacific train that had jumped the tracks, setting off huge blasts that sent parts of tanker cars soaring nearly half a mile. No fatalities were reported. [A1 :1‐2.] Aid for Cambodians was cleared by the pro‐Vietnamese Government in Phnom Penh, which assured six American congresswomen it would accept all international supplies to relieve widespread famine and disease. [A1 :2‐4.] Israel's Government lost a vote in Parliament in an attempt to restrict abortions. Some Government representatives joined in rejecting an amendment to the abortion law by a vote of 54 to 54. The defeated bill would have permitted abortions only in cases of danger to the mother's physical or mental health. At present, abortions are also allowed for social or economic reasons. [A5:1.] China's crackdown on dissent mounted as an editor of an underground journal was arrested after he voluntarily went to the authorities to try to aid four persons who were seized Sunday. [A5:1.] National A recall of about 1.3 million cars was announced by General Motors to replace two seat‐belt anchor bolts that could break under stress. All of the cars involved are 1979 models except 18,000 early 1980 models. The voluntary recall raised to 35 the number announced this year by G.M., the nation's largest auto maker. [A16:1.] The Cabinet shake‐up last summer has resulted in a new style of leadership but little change in policy. White House officials say that this was the objective of President Carter when he shifted the leadership of the departments of Transportation; Health, Education and Welfare and Housing and Urban Development. [A16:2‐5.] • Key endorsements are being sought in the Presidential race. President Carter has done particularly well with mayors and governors, many of whom depend heavily on Federal funds to run their administrations. Carter campaign officials are counting on people like Gov. Richard W. Riley of South Carolina to play a major role in organizing their local efforts. [B13:1‐3.] A drive against United Way, the combined charity organization, was opened by critics who called on the Government to compel the television networks to present arguments opposing the agency's fund‐raising efforts during broadcasts of professional football games. The critics contend that United Way raises funds mostly for old, established groups and almost none for controversial organizations. [B12:3‐4.] Metropolitan Reagan strength is so strong in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut in the opinion of the former Governor of California that he plans to challenge any delegate slates not committed to him. In the last Presidential campaign, Ronald Reagan was all but shut out in the three states, a heartland of liberal Republicanism. [A1 :1.] A $2.1‐million theft of wristwatches was carried out in a factory vault in the Hackensack Meadowlands. The authorities said that about 1,500 Lucien Piccard watches were stolen over the weekend by thieves who cut telephone trunk lines, knocking out hundreds of burglary alarm systems and disrupting telephohe service at police stations in three communities. [A1 :1.] An inquiry into distribution of papers and magazines in the New York metropolitan area has been conducted by the F.B.I. for more than a year to determine whether the deliverers’ union and organized crime figures have been extorting illegal payoffs from wholesalers, according to law enforcement officials. A Federal grand jury has been hearing testimony in the case for several months.

OBSERVER; The Ship Of Followers,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/13/archives/observer-the-ship-of-followers.html,"By Russell Baker What does this country need today? Leadership. What kind of leadership? Strong, effective and dynamic leadership. What is necessary for the country to satisfy its appetite for strong, effective and dynamic leadership? A President who can lead. Where does the country want to be led? In Washington. Let me rephrase the question using worser grammar: Where does the country want to be led to? The country does not want to be led to. It wants to be led in. Led in what? In direction. Can you elucidate? The country wants to be led in direction of restoration of American greatness, as well as directions of revival of the American spirit and re‐establishment of America's position of respect in the world. Do I assume correctly, then, that the country wants to be led back toward that past that is commonly sentimentalized in the misleading phrase, “the good old days”? Nonsense. The country wants to be led toward new directions. It yearns for new leadership with a new vision of a new era. If led, will the country follow? If given the right kind of leadership, the country will surely follow. Which kind of leadership is the right kind? The leadership that leads the country toward directions it wants to take. And what specific directions does the country want to take? Who knows? That's for the leader to figure out. If he is the right kind of leader, he will guess correctly. In which direction does the country yearn to be led in the matter of abortion? North, south, east, west, and all points in between. Would you guess that a leader would not have much followership if he tried to lead in this matter? In some things the country doesn't want to be led. What about a leader who decides tc ;top the dollar hemorrhage by taxing gasoline at a dollar per gallon? Not much chance of that. Carter tried to add two cents a gallon to the tax and got clobbered by Congress. No leader can lead long if he tries funneling the gasoline gouge back to Washington instead of shipping it abroad to OPEC. Then what should a leader propose in the way of leadership if he wants to remain strong, effective and dynamic? He should find out what the country wants him to propose and then propose it. Are there any important matters, either foreign or domestic, on which the country clamors for its leadership to make proposals? Hundreds of them. In Soviet‐American relations, for example, what proposal made by leader would earn him countrywide followership? None. Some people around the country would follow him on one proposal, while others would abandon the wagon train. On another proposal, the followership might split off in different proportions. Are you quite sure that the country wants leadership? That's what all the polls say. If the country wants leadership, why is it so difficult to identify a single goal toward which it wants to be led in either foreign or domestic affairs? That's wrong. The country wants peace. Hasn't it had peace throughout President Carter's Administration? Sure, but it hasn't been strong, effective and dynamic peace. Anyhow the country also wants a strong dollar and Carter hasn't supplied one. What measures for strengthening the dollar would, if taken by Carter, enjoy the country's followership? That's a silly question. The country's so divided about economics that nothing Carter proposes could get past Congress, so there's no point in his proposing anything. Am I wrong in concluding that isn't leadership the country wants in President but followership? It doesn't hurt a leader any if he avoids trying to lead on things that get people upset, which is just about everything. But that still doesn't mean the country doesn't want leadership. How can you have a strong leader he spends all his energy trying to follow the led? The trick is in making good chin muSic. He's got to stick out that jaw and sound like a leader, and if he makes enough noise he can get away with it for two or three years before everybody starts yearning for leadership all over again. You can't fool all of the people all of the time, but if you make a good noise, you can come pretty close for a few years."
Group Says United Way's TV Ads Violate Fairness Doctrine of F. C. C.; Reaction of United Way,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/13/archives/group-says-united-ways-tv-ads-violate-fairness-doctrine-of-fcc.html,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 12 — A coalition of charities critical of United Way accused the combined charity of broadcasting advertisements that presented only one side of a controversial topic and called on the Federal Communications Commission to compel the television networks to present “the other side.” In a news conference today, the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy said that, despite United Way's assertion that it represents the gamut of charitable activities in various communities, the organization raises money mostly for old‐line established groups and almost none for such controversial, militant or activist organizations as abortion clinics or consumer groups. The committee, which represents about 100 nonprofit environmental and advocacy groups, said it would file a petition tomorrow with the commission charging that United Way's advertisements violate the fairness doctrine by presenting only one side of a controversial issue. The committee did not specify any remedy for its complaint, but Andrew Jay Schwartzman, an attorney for the committee, said that if the networks were cited by the F.C.C., they would be allowed to suggest appropriate remedies. Public service announcements on behalf of United Way broadcast during professional football games usually feature player from the game with portrayals of local welfare or social agency work. They end with a slogan, “Thanks to you, it works for all of us.” Anthony Ripley, a spokesman for United Way, said: “We do not mean to indicate through our slogan that United Way encompasses all community activities, but it is important to remember that our local affiliates decide who in their areas will get United Way support. It is also important to realize that even the ‘old‐line’ groups these days are getting into nontraditional activities.” Robert 0. Bothwell, executive director of the coalition group challenging United Way, said: “We believe that the United Way announcements give a fraudulent and inaccurate impression of American philanthropy.” Mr. Schwartzman, who heads the Media Access Project, a group that seeks to broaden the discussion of issues in radio and television broadcasting, said that, “under the rules of the commission, where controversial issues of public im‐. portance are concerned stations must present overall coverage that gives time to various viewpoints.” Among other groups represented at the news conference today were the Gray Panthers, which works for the rights of the elderly; the National Black United Fund, which emphasizes help for black community social works, and the Consumer Federation of America, a coalition of organizations that address Issues of interest to consumers. Mr. Bothwell and Mr. Schwartzman said they had tried in the last few months to talk to network executives and to Pete Rozelle, commissioner of the National Footbal League. The networks have rejected the contention that the public service announcements an behalf of United Way are controversial, Mr. Schwartzman said, and Mr. Rozelle, whose wife is a member of United Way's board of. directors, has not responded to a letter sent to him in September. ‘Information Cannot Hurt’ “We think this is a rock‐hard case,” Mr. Schwartzman added, “and we're surprised that the networks would not settle this voluntarily by presenting other views; information certainly cannot hurt people.” In New York, a spokesman for the National Football League said he was not aware of any letter to Mr. Rozelle but, added that the league had not limited its public service announcements to United Way. “While Uhited Way of America messages have appeared frequently, the National Football League has also presented li the President's Council on Physical Fitness, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Department of Labor and many others,” the spokesman said. In recent months an even larger battle has been taking place between United Way and other charitable organizations over the right to be aided by donors’ payroll deductions. The challenging organizations contend that United Way had conspired with employers to be the sole beneficiary of payroll deductions, a contention that Mr. Ripley denied today."
Anti‐Abortion Party Gaining Strength; Vote Doubled in City,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/13/archives/antiabortion-party-gaining-strength-vote-doubled-in-city.html,"By FRANKLYNN In its first election as an established political party last week, the Right to Life Party emerged as a strong competitor to the Conservative Party by polling nearly as many votes as the Conservatives in municipal elections, particularly in the New York metropolitan area. The new party's showing was significant because it came in a low‐turnout, off‐year election for local officials who do not deal directly with the abortion issue — the issue that is the reason for the new party's existence. The party's 600‐plus candidates throughout New York State appeared generally to have done nearly as well as Conservative candidates whether the anti‐abortion candidates were allied with one or more of the other parties or were running on their own. Their candidates also invariably ran well ahead of Liberal Party candidates outside New York City, as they did last year when they established themselves as the state's fourth ranking party behind the Democrats, Republicans and Conservatives. There were many signals of Right to Life Party strength. Although last week's overall turnout was considerably less than in last year's election for Governor, the anti‐abortion party markedly increased its total vote in raw numbers and percentages in Long Island and New York City. The party more than doubled its vote in New York City. Eugene J. McMahon, a Right to Life Party lawyer and himself a candidate, predicted after this year's election that the party would poll 300,000 votes statewide in the Presidential election next year — more than double its showing in the election for Governor last year, when its line was at the bottom of the voting machine. This year and next it will be on Row ID, the fourth line on the ballot. In the race for Suffolk County Executive, Conservatives and Right to Life candidates endorsed the same unknown Conservative candidate, William A. Matthews. The Conservatives polled about 19,000 votes for him — far below the 30,000 that the party polled in the same race four years ago — while the Right to Life Party tallied 9,000 votes for him. In two countywide contests in Nassau, the Conservatives polled about 22,000 votes, only 2,000 votes more than the Right to Life candidates. Even in Democratic New York City, the Right to Life candidates did well relative to the Conservatives. In contests for State Supreme Court judgeships in Queens — where party line voting rather than personalities is a determining factor in the vote — three Right to Life candidates ran ahead of three of Conservatives. In the Manhattan‐Bronx judicial distric the Right to Life candidate for State Supreme Court ran only 1,000 votes behind the Conservative; and in Westchester County the Conservative Party candidates for State Supreme Court tallied about 27,000 votes, only 6,000 more than the Right to Life Party contenders. In the Bronx, the Right to Life candidate for Borough President outpolled the Conservative by a 2 to 1 margin. Upstate, in the contest for Erie County Executive and other contests in the Buffalo and Syracuse areas, the Conservative Party fared somewhat better than did downstate, generally outpolling the Right to Life Party candidates by margins of up to 3 to 1. One Issue, Chairman Says Mary Jane Tobin, state chairman of the Right to Life Party and its candidate for Governor last year, said the party was not interested in competing with the Conservatives or other parties but was involved with the single issue of restricting abortions in New York State. However, even the Conservative Party executive director, as well as Republican and Democratic politicians, conceded that the anti‐abortion party's relatively strong showing would at a minimum dilute the bargaining leverage of the Conservatives by offering major party candidates an alternative to the Conservatives. “That's a political reality,” said Serphin R. Maltese, the Conservative official. The Erie County Democratic chairman, Joseph F. Crangle, said he looked for more alliances between the Democrats and Right to Life candidates upstate as a way to counter RepublicanConservative alliances. Mr. Maltese, while acknowledging this possibility, predicted that in most cases Conservatives and Right to Life candidates would be allied rather than competing. He added, however, that he was concerned that other one‐issue groups,'seeing their success,” might follow the lead of the anti‐abortion party, further splintering the political parties in the state. A similar concern has often been voiced about the Conservatives by major party politicians."
Begin Cabinet Shaken By Defeat of Attempt To Curtail Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/13/archives/begin-cabinet-shaken-by-defeat-of-attempt-to-curtail-abortions.html,"United Press International TEL AVIV, Nov. 12 — Prime Minister Menachem Begin's Government was shaken today by a defeat in Parliament of an attempt to restrict the scope of the country's abortion law. Some of its own representatives joined with the opposition in rejecting the amendment, in a tie vote of 54 to 54. PARLIAMENTARY SETBACK IN ISRAEL: Prime Minister Menachem Begin shrugged and raised his hands after defeat in parliament in vote on government‐sponsored amendment for a stricter abortion law. Behind him Is Shlomo Lorincz of Agudat Israel party, which supported amendment. At left is Simcha Erlich. Page A5. Special to The New York Times As a result, the governing coalition faced a possible walkout by one of its partners, the small ultraorthodox Agudat Israel Party, which had made a restriction of abortions the price for joining the Cabinet in 1977. The Government bill that was defeated would have allowed a termination of pregnancy only in case of danger to the mother's physical or mental health. At present, abortions are allowed also for social or economic reasons. As a result of the defeat, Agudat Israel turned to its spiritual authority, a council of Torah sages, for guidance on whether to instruct its four members of Parliament to withdraw their support from the Government and thereby cut the Cabinet's majority to one. Such a margin would be precarious because some proGovernment legislators have been complaining about Mr. Begin over other issues as well, saying, for example, that he has not been insistent enough on settling Jews on occupied Arab land. One member of Parliament from Agudat Israel said he would recommend that the sages give the Government another chance since Mr. Begin and his associates had made what he described as a sincere effort to live up to their pledges. Tension mounted in Parliament today as the roll was called on the abortion bill. When Speaker Yitzhak Shamir announced that the vote was a tie and that, as a result, the bill had been rejected in its first test, opposition members on the floor and women in the gallery cheered. When Mr. Begin pledged in June 1977 that the bill would be amended, he needed the support of Agudat Israel to give him Parliamentary majority of two. Deputy Prime Minister Yigael Yadin's Democratic Movement joined the coalition later, increasing the margin to five, and was not a party to the Likud agreement with the religious party. The movement's members present for the vote, including Justice Minister Shmuel Tamir, voted against the Government bill."
Kennedy Tells Iowans Carter Farm Policy Is a Failure; Abortion Issue in State,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/13/archives/kennedy-tells-iowans-carter-farm-policy-is-a-failure-abortion-issue.html,"DES MOINES, Nov. 12 — Senator Edward M. Kennedy, traveling to the heart of the Farm Belt and the state he has called “the first real test” of the 1980 political campaign, charged today that President Carter had failed tb give the country a stable auriculture policy. The Massachusetts Democrat said that the Carter Administration had left farmers in doubt about financing for next year's crops, had neglected their transportation needs and had not pushed for tougher grain deals with the Soviet Union. “I think we can do more to stabilize the predictability of agriculture for Americans,” Senator Kennedy added as he began the second week of his campaign. Iowa, where farmers are just winding up one of the most successful growing seasons in years, will begin the process of chosing delegates for the 1980 Democratic nominating convention in a round of caucuses scheduled for Jan. 21. In the 1976 campaign, Mr. Carter first gained national attention by coming in first in the caucuses. But this time he is by no means assured of victory, despite the good farm year and much early work throughout the state by his representatives. The Senator attacked President Carter's farm policy in an address to several hundred campaign workers and volunteers at St. Ambrose College in Davenport. While at St. Ambrose College, a Roman Catholic school, Mr. Kennedy encountered a number of demonstrators who oppose abortion, always an extremely controversial issue in Iowa politics because of the state's large Catholic population. Although he is a Catholic, Senator Kennedy has voted for Federal programs that provide aid for poor women seeking abortions. President Carter opposes Federal financing of abortions. Last year the abortion issue was a major factor in the defeat of Senator Dick Clark of Iowa, now a high‐ranking member of Mr. Kennedy's campaign staff. Like Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Clark favored Federal financing. On Oct. 30 Mr. Clark resigned as the Administration's Coordinator for Refugee Affairs to join the Kennedy staff. Senator Kennedy was accompanied to Iowa by his 89‐year‐old mother, Rose; his oldest son, Edward M. Kennedy Jr.; and one of his sisters, Eunice Kennedy Shriven Since beginning his campaign formally last week, the Senator has been traveling with members of the large Kennedy clan, a move that appears to have won him an extra measure of photographic and television coverage. Mrs. Kennedy, who only a month or so ago underwent a major operation for an intestinal blockage, was spry and smiling today as she appeared with her only surviving son. “I know you've supported my other sons when they were aspiring to this great position in America,” she told cheering Davenport crowd. “I thank you for supporting Ted.”"
New Style Emerging After Shake‐Up in the Cabinet; Contrast in Leadership,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/13/archives/new-style-emerging-after-shakeup-in-the-cabinet-contrast-in.html,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 12 — Patricia Roberts Harris has held but one full‐scale news conference since she became Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare last summer. She refuses to divulge her personal views on abortion or to be assertive on the dangers of smoking, and she has spent countless hours alone in her office mastering the nuances of her department's budget. That is in sharp contrast to her predecessor, Joseph A. Califano Jr., who spoke in public regularly on the touchy political issues facing the department and who left attention to detail to his staff assistants. Moon Landrieu, the new Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, spent more than a third of the working days during his first months in office out of town, including appearances at two political fund‐raising affairs in New Jersey. Mrs. Harris, when she was Housing Secretary, rarely left town and attended few purely political functions. Neil E. Goldschmidt, the Secretary of Transportation, picked a skillful black politician from Detroit, whom he had not met before he came to Washington, as his Deputy Secretary. The former Secretary, Brock Adams, had surrounded himself with men and women most of whom had worked for him in Congress. There are, in short, new styles of operation at the top of the three Cabinet departments most heavily involved with social issues, although there has been little change in the Carter Administration's policies. According to White House officials, it was precisely that, a change in style but a continuation of policy, that President Carter intended last July when he dismissed Mr. Califano and Mr. Adams, shifted Mrs. Harris's post and brought in Mr. Landrieu and Mr. Goldschmidt. “We were satisfied with the thrust of our policies,” said a senior White House official who works closely with the three departments, “but, quite frankly, we were dissatisfied with the way Califano and Adams operated.” Mr. Califano and Mr. Adams were viewed by the White House, according to Mr. Carter's aides, as unguided missiles who resisted Presidential direction and could not be relied upon for solid political advice. The Presidential assistants agreed to be interviewed on the ground that they not be quoted by name. On the question of Presidential direction, the White House staff members said that Mr. Califano and Mr. Adams had insisted naming former colleagues and personal friends as top assistants. By contrast, the new No. 2 official at the Department of Housing and Urban Development is to be Victor Marrero, the New York State Housing Commissioner, who is of Puerto Rican descent and who will be the highest ranking HispanicAmerican man ever to serve in the Government. The new Deputy Secretary of Transportation is to be William J. Beckham Jr., who is black and who was Deputy Mayor of Detroit under Coleman A. Young, an important political ally of President Carter. Mr. Landrieu and Mr. Goldschmidt said in interviews that, while they had been given the final say in selecting their deputies, the names of Mr. Marrero and Mr. Beckham had been provided by the White House. Officials there said that, in addition to their abilities, both men met the political needs of the President. “Some things are fair game politically and some are not,” Mr. Landrieu said in an interview. “Making Presidential appointments for political reasons is certainly fair game.” The officials criticized Mr. Califano's assurance while in office that Congress would go along with cuts in Social Security benefits proposed early this year by the Administration. In fact, Congress never seriously considered the cuts, but the proposal put the Administration in a bad light with the senior citizens’ lobby. Mr. Adams was never enthusiastic about the Administration's aim of reducing Federal regulation of the transportation industry, and he was, by his own admission, frozen out of Administration deliberations on energy policy. Pressing Carter Goals Mr. Goldschmidt, on the other hand, said that one of his primary goals in the next year would be to achieve railroad and trucking deregulation. He has also worked closely with energy officials from the White House and other agencies to develop a policy for spending a portion of the revenues from taxes on oil companies’ profits on mass transit. The fact that the Cabinet turnover has led to little change in substantive policies is largely a function of the political calendar. The major policy initatives were taken in the first two years of the President's term. The second two years are being devoted to gaining legislative approval and putting the policies into effect. “What I want to do most now is make the programs we have more effective,” Mrs. Harris said. Mr. Landrieu said he had “no mandate to change policies.” Nonetheless, there have been some modest changes in social policy since the new Cabinet team took over. Mr. Goldschmidt has accepted the idea of allowing new starts on rail transit systems to be financed out of the “windfall” oil profits tax receipts. Mrs. Harris has taken the position that rules on high school dress and hair length should be part of the Government's sex discrimination regulations. Mr. Califano took the opposite view. Mrs. Harris has also reversed the Califano position that, if hospital cost‐containment legislation fails, the Government should try to use the leverage of Medicare and Medicaid to hold costs down. Mr. Landrieu said that he would try to change President Carter's mind about limiting Federal revenue‐sharing funds to cities and counties. States get a third of the money now. Mr. Landrieu said he agreed with Mr. Carter on the merits of the issue but felt that “it would be impossible to make such a radical change” in 1980, an election year, when the revenuesharing program comes up for renewal. Big Changes at H.E.W. The change in the style of leadership has been most apparent at the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Mr. Califano tackled controversial issues publicly and head‐on. Mrs. Harris has kept out of the limelight. The announcement, for example, that the Government would file a desegregation suit against the Chicago school system was made by David S. Tatel, then head of the Office for Civil Rights, not by Mrs. Harris. She let Leonard Schaeffer, head of the Health Care Financing Administration, announce last month the department's decision to aid Brooklyn Jewish Hospital, and she had the Surgeon General, Dr. Julius B. Richmond, announce the success of the department's childhood immunization program. Mrs. Harris said that she believed in giving authority to her “line officers.” She also said, “Shouting demonstrates an absence of power.” A middle‐ranking health official said that his office was often shaken by “lightning bolts” directly from Mr. Califano. Now, he said, orders from Mrs. Harris come through the Assistant Secretary. Mrs. Harris has had some legislative successes on measures that Mr. Califano could not move. For example, the House of Representatives approved an Administration welfare bill this week, and the hospital cost‐containment legislation is almost ready to go to the floor of the House for a vote. Change Not Always Apparent While Mrs. Harris and some members of the White House staff say she deserves credit for the legislative action, ranking members of the House say the bills would have advanced even if Mr. Califano had remained in office. “I have no quarrel with the support I've been given by Pat Harris,” said Representative James C. Corman, chairman of the special welfare committee, “but then I had no quarrel with the support from Califano either.” On one matter, Mrs. Harris seems, from the White House point of view, no better at mending political fences than was Mr. Califano. With his strong statements against smoking and his efforts to desegregate the state's university system, Mr. Califano had become anathema to many in North Carolina. Mrs. Harris has kept relatively quiet on the dangers of smoking, and she has yet to act on the latest plan by North Carolina officials to avert a cutoff of Government aid to the university system. But, last month, after a meeting with her in Washington, William C. Friday, the president of the university system, returned to North Carolina with a report that Mrs. Harris had been ruder to him than any other high Government official he had ever dealt with. The episode led to a formal complaint to the White House from Gov. James B. Hunt Jr., one of the first of the nation's Governors to come out strongly for Mr. Carter's renomination.

Bill on Detailing Risk in Abortion Passed in Jersey; Measure Requires Doctors to Outline Alternatives Action Called Irresponsible,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/14/archives/bill-on-detailing-risk-in-abortion-passed-in-jersey-measure.html,"TRENTON, Nov. 13 — The New Jersey State Senate adopted this evening a bill that requires physicians to inform a woman seeking an abortion of the “inherent” dangers of the procedure and of al  ternatives, such as adoption. The measure also imposes a 24‐hour waiting period after the woman signs an “Informed consent” document before the abortion can be performed. The measure was passed 27 to 9 after nearly three hours of emotional debate and was returned to the Assembly, which must concur in Senate amendments before the bill goes to Governor Byrne for his signature. Aides to Mr. Byrne indicated that he may veto the measure or return it for further changes. Proponents of the measure said it was designed only to regulate abortions in line with rulings by the United States Supreme Court. However, opponents said the measure constituted psychological harassment of women seeking abortions and was a thinly veiled attempt to abrogate rights of privacy for women upheld by the Supreme Court. The Senate majority leader, John F. Russo, Democrat of Toms River, said toward the end of the debate that abortion itself and not simply its regulation was at the heart of the legislation. Senator Matthew Feldman, Democrat of Teaneck, said that he was personally opposed to abortion but that the Legislature was acting irresponsibly in enacting a law that he said clearly violates established constitutional guidelines. “The Supreme Court has told us that woman has an absolute right to an abortion during the first two trimesters”—or three‐month periods—“and viability does not occur until the third trimester,” he said. “It gives us the right to more closely control the medical conditions during the second trimester, but does not give us the right to create unnecessary obstacles which infringe upon the woman's right to privacy.” Senator Francis X. Herbert, Democrat of Waldwick, attacked the measure as “lacking compassion and humanity.” He predicted that a controversial section requiring physicians to notify parents of pregnant minor who seeks an abortion will send many teen‐agers to “back‐alley quacks.” Before passage, the bill was amended to delete a long preamble stating that it’ was the Legislature's belief that life begins at the moment of conception. Proponents agreed that the language might attract adverse judicial notice. The measure also was amended to require destruction of implied consent forms a year after they are signed."
"House, Voting Money Bill, Sets Stage for New Fight on Abortion Five Departments Affected",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/14/archives/house-voting-money-bill-sets-stage-for-new-fight-on-abortion-five.html,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 — Another bruising fight over abortion began shaping up today as the House approved an emergency appropriation bill setting strict limits on the use of Fedtral funds to terminate pregnancies. With the Senate expected to insist on more liberal abortion policy, as it has done in the past, the two houses are likely to stage a fight similar to the one that threatened payless paydays for several million Federal employees last month. The emergency money bill to which the House attached abortion limitations would allow Federal departments and agencies whose regular appropriation bills have not yet passed Congress to spend at last year's levels. Those departments and agencies are now vesting under a similar emergency appropriations bill, enacted a month ago, that is scheduled to expire next Tuesday. The resolution passed today by the House would continue temporary financing for the Departments of Defense, Transportation, Interior, Labor, and Health, Education and Welfare, and for military construction and foreign assistance programs. Unless the Senate and House agree on such temporary financing for the period s g next Tuesday, employees in those departments and programs could receive smaller paychecks after Thanksgiving At Issue now, as it was a month ago, is the use of Federal funds for abortions. As passed today by the House and sent to the Senate, the money bill would limit the use of Federal funds for abortions to those cases in which a mother's life is endangered. The Senate has consistently insisted on broadening such abortion policy to include instances of rape and incest and cases in which two physicians certify that a woman's physical health would be impaired if the p gnan is not terminated. After weeks of negotiations, the Senate and House finally agreed in the temporary money bill passed a month ago to allow abortions when a mother's life is endangered and in cases of rape and incest — stronger than the House version but weaker than the Senate version. Two weeks ago, the House reaffirmed its original position when it rejected, by vote of 219 to 187, a motion to include in the regular H.E.W. appropriations bill the slightly more liberal abortion language agreed to in the temporary bill scheduled to expire next Tuesday. As a result of that House vote, the three‐month deadlock between the Senate and House over the regular H.E.W.Labor appropriations bill has continued. The abortion issue has also deadlocked Senate and House conferees dealing with regular money bills for foreign aid and the Defense Department. However, abortion is not an issue in regular appropriations bills for military construction and for the Departments of Interior and Transportation. These bills are expected to clear Congress before the end of the month."
Israeli Conservatives Plan a New Attempt to Tighten Abortion Laws; 60.000 Illegal Abortions Yearly; Approval by Committee Needed,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/14/archives/israeli-conservatives-plan-a-new-attempt-to-tighten-abortion-laws.html,"JERUSALEM, Nov. 13‐Conservative members of Prime Minister Menachem Begin's coalition Cabinet regrouped today for another effort to repeal liberal. ized provisions of an abortion law, after a narrow defeat in Parliament yesterday. Special to The New York Times Agudat Israel, a religious party that threatened to resign from the coalition if the law was not amended, appeared ready to stay and make a second try, possibly within two weeks. It appeared doubtful that the opponents of abortion would be able to muster the required votes, however. The statute, which permits abortion where “continuation of pregnancy is liable to cause serious harm to the woman or her children, owing to the difficult family or social conditions of the woman and her environment,” took effect last year and resulted in making abortions available to lower‐class women, usually Jews from Arab countries who lack contraceptive information. Previously, middle‐class women, usually of European or American background, were able to have illegal abortions performed by private physicians in their offices. Some experts estimate that there are 60,000 of these a year. Despite the illegality of abortions, no Israel doctor has been prosecuted. After tne relaxation of the law under the former Government, Agudat Israel and the National Religious Party made a condition of their joining Mr. Begin's coalition that the law be altered to prohibit abortions for social reasons. The effort to do that failed yesterday when the vote in Parliament ended in a 54‐54 tie, with two abstentions and several absences, mostly by those favoring the liberalized abortion clause. The debate was sharp and emotions were high. But the issue appeared to have engaged the politicians with more rancor than the public at large, possibly because it became the focus of a test of political power and of a Government pledge. Both moral and patriotic arguments have been voiced against liberalized abortions. Many religious Jews share the view of the Roman Catholic Church that destroying a fetus is equivalent to murder and that it is immoral to take the life of the unborn. In addition, politicians use a demographic argument, citing the low birthrate among Jews and the high rate among Arabs as a cause for concern. Israel has always been sensitive to the need to increase its population naturally and through immigration, and the politicians worry that a low birthrate saps the country's strength in the face of vast populations of Arabs in surrounding countries, and in Israel itself. Experts believe that tightening the law will simply force women with origins in Arab countries to have large families in lives of poverty and, at the same time, deny them educational material on birth control, which is currently distributed to every woman seeking an abortion in a hospital. The present law requires that abortions for social or economic reasons, which now constitute 43 percent of all abortions, according to the Health Ministry, be approved by a hospital committee composed of a physician, a social worker, a psychiatrist and a nurse. The committees give women information on contraception, which will be denied them if the law is changed, experts say. In the debate yesterday the Parliament chamber echoed to cries of “Shame!” “Liar!” and “Slave trader!” Moshe Dayan, an independent who resigned as Foreign Minister last month, voted against repeal.

This angered members from the right wing, but it seemed to guarantee that the amendment would not be approved on a second attempt."
Brother Joseph and Legal ‘Right to Die’; Catechism Is Recalled,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/14/archives/brother-joseph-and-legal-right-to-die-catechism-is-recalled.html,"MINEOLA, L.I. Nov. 13 — In Brother Joe's small rooms at Chaminade High School, his chair is surrounded by cases of homemade root beer, cassette tapes of the Scriptures and science fiction novels sent him by the Xavier Society for the Blind, samples of the smooth calligraphic hand in which he penned names to the school's diplomas, and a picture of the auxiliary bishop of Baltimore he coached in high school basketball. In his glass room in the intensive care unit of Nassau Hospital, there is nothing but a vital signs monitor and the respirator that breathes for him while, six blocks away, the Marianist community breathes quiet prayers that a state court will allow them to disconnect the comatose 83‐year‐old brother from the mechanism. In keeping with the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church, as expressed by Pope Pius XII in a 1957 speech to a group of anesthesiologists, they consider the respirator “an extraordinary measure which need not be used to prolong life,” and they are asking that the court “let his life end naturally so that his body may be treated with the dignity he would have wanted.” In the first such suit in New York State, the Marianist community seeks to be authorized to turn off the respirator that has sustained Brother Joseph Charles Fox since he suffered a cardiorespiratory arrest and severe brain damage from lack of oxygen during a hernia operation Oct. 2. “It's like your 10‐cent Baltimore Catechism said,” according to Norbert Mechenbier, a grocer in Greenville, Pa., who speaks for Brother Joseph's 12 nieces and nephews who have joined the Marianist suit. “Why did God make us? He made us to know Him, to love Him, to serve Him in this life and be with Him in the next. Well, Uncle Joe knew Him, loved Him, and served Him and now it's like there's a barrier there — somebody's said, ‘We're going to let this ventilator run, so you can't come in over the threshold, Uncle Joe.’ “ The community's lawyer, William F. Levine, will argue before the State Supreme Court here tomorrow essentially the same case that was argued before New Jersey courts in 1975 to allow the disconnection of Karen Anne Quinlan's respirator: that the patient, although not completely dead, had a constitutional right to privacy that allowed her to decide whether life support equipment could be shut off when it could not save her, and that that right could be exercised for a helpless patient by a court‐appointed guardian, called a “committee.” Decision Left to Doctors After the New Jersey Supreme Court decision, Miss Quinlan, now 25 years old, was “weaned” from the life support system and although still in a coma, she is breathing on her own. According to Mr. Levine, the New Jersey Supreme Court recognized the right to privacy, but left the shutoff decision to doctors in consultation with the family, so he will also argue citing the precedent set by a 1977 case in Massachusetts, Belchertown v. Saikowicz, which allowed a guardian to deny chemotherapy to a severely retarded ward dying of leukemia. In this case, the Marianist community seeks to have its president, the Rev. Philip K. Eichner, or, failing that, Mr. Mechenbier, declared a “committee” to decide whether to disconnect the respirator. According to its members, the religious community had discussed the Quinlan case several times, and Brother Joseph had said he did not want extraordinary means used to preserve his life. “If he were here, he'd say ‘Oh, Father, what are they doing to me now? I don't want any of that stuff,’ “ said the Rev. Francis T. Keenan, head of the Marianist Province. Although there is no disagreement between the family and the religious community, the court, if it agrees that the patient has the right to privacy that would allow shutting off the respirator, would then presumably have to decide whether to make Brother Joseph's Marianist brothers or his remaininE relatives his committee. Legal Points Explained “American law does recognize persons who have taken a vow of poverty,” Father Eichner said. “A brother cannot be taxed, and he is also not eligible for government education grants. But it does not recognize the relationship at the end of life — the brother's estate, if he has one, is separate from the community's.” Brother Joseph's legacy, not in goods, but in service to his fellows in the Society of Mary, which he joined when he was 15, is evident in his old MOM. Although legally blind since the capillaries in his retinas collapsed three years ago, leaving him with only a little vision out the sides of his eyes, he still made root beer, wrote laboriously on lined paper to his students, nieces and nephews, and worked in the kitchen, peeling potatoes by feel, Father Eichner said. He also planted alyssum, dusty millers and small red begonias in the boxes he carried to the roof. “He got that hernia dragging that dirt up here,” Father Eichner, said. “When I saw that we weren't going to be able to keep him sedentary — he used to do things like get up at midnight to stuff a 40‐pound turkey ‐ I agreed with the doctor to have him have the surgery.” Minimal Brain Wave Activity But the diagnosis of Brother Joseph's condition after his heart stopped on the operating table, as filed in court affidavits by attending doctors, is that he has minimal brain wave activity, will probably never move or have cognitive thought and will probably die soon after being taken off the respirator. Nassau Hospital refused the request made by Father Eichner and Brother Joseph's doctors to shut off the respirator, although it is cooperating with its request for a court order. Moreover, to avoid any legal liability, the hospital is asking the court, should it give the religious community or the family the right to disconnect the respirator, to require that someone not on the hospital staff do it. As happened in the Quinlan case, other groups have entered the proceedings. The Nassau County District Attorney's office had two neurologists examine Brother Joseph and may decide to threaten anyone who disconnects the respirator with a murder charge — although in New Jersey, the Supreme Court specifically prevented the State Attorney General from doing that when it ordered Miss Quinlan's respirator disconnected, saying that such a death was from natural causes, not homicide, and even if homicide, justifiable. Groups who favor euthanasia, or mercy killing of the ill, have called the school, wanting their views included, Father Keenan said. Organ transplant groups who would like to see a definition of death written into the law since the concept of “brain death” is not recognized in New York State law —have called, as have faith healers. “They offered to pray over him,” Father Keenan said. “We said we'd take care of that.” “The point is not whether Brother Joe is brain dead now or his soul has fled his body,” Father Eichner said. “The point is that he is in an irreversible process of death, which you should not try.to stop,” he continued, comparing his position to the church's on abortion, which he called an attempt to stop an irreversible process of life.

Campaign Letter Angers Conservative L.I. Parties,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/15/archives/campaign-letter-angers-conservative-li-parties-letter-called-an.html,"HUNTINGTON, L.I., Nov. 12 — A letter mailed to members of Jewish organizations here the weekend before Election Day by a prominent town Democrat attempted to discourage voting for candidates of the anti‐abortion Right to Life Party and the Conservative Party on ethnic and religious grounds and by a reference to the Holocaust. The letter was signed by Irving Klein, a major contributor and fund‐raiser for Representative Jerome Ambro, a Democrat whose district includes Huntington. Mr. Klein said in an interview that the letter had been “sent by the Democratic Party” to about 1,200 Jewish voters. Mr. Klein, a businessman, discussed the issues of abortion and women's rights in the letter and then compared what he called a Conservative's advocacy of “news control” to the “type of control that allowed the Holocaust to devastate Europe.” Two of the candidates mentioned in the letter, Claire A. Kroft and Robert Lifson, Republicans who ran with Conservative and Right to Life endorsement, are Jewish. Mr. Lifson, some of whose relatives were victims of the Nazis, denounced the letter as an “affront to every Jew.” The town Republican leader, Alexander Brandshaft, said there was “no question” that the Democratic leadership in Huntington “had a role” in the sending of the letter because they realized that their candidates were in trouble. The Democrats lost control of the township, although Town Supervisor Kenneth C. Butterfield, a Democrat, was re‐elected. Mr. Butterfield, whose unsuccessful opponent was Mrs. Kroft, said that he had been aware of the letter and that he shared the concern that “one‐issue people are very dangerous to our constitutional form of government.” Representataive Ambro said he had been unaware of the letter, had not seen it and therefore could not comment. He described Mr. Klein as his “good friend.” Letter's Contents Described Mr. Klein said that he was “sorry if I offended anyone,” but that he did not regret sending the letter. “Some of the things that were happening with women's rights and the so‐called moral leadership of the Conservative Party scare me because I don't know where that leads,” he declared. His letter described pressure that was put on Republican members of the Suffolk County Legislature earlier this year to defeat a proposed county women's commission, and it denounced Conservative Party opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment and sex education. It also charged that the Conservative Party leader John Kay favored “censorship of television programs, films and recordings to eliminate what he calls ‘pornography.’ “ “Ignore the Conservative Party's goal of censorship, and give your tacit approval of news control — the same type of control that allowed the Holocaust to devastate Europe,” the letter said. Mr. Kay called the letter “unfortunate,” and said he had met with Mr. Klein and had asked him for the names of those who received the letter so that he might rebut it. As for whether it affected the election, Mr. Brandshaft said he believed it had had some effect, but Donald Doyle of Sufolk, treasurer of the interim State Right to Life Committee, discounted it."
Senate Vote Assures Clash With House on U.S. Funds for Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/16/archives/senate-vote-assures-clash-with-house-on-us-funds-for-abortions.html,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 15— Unwilling to accept strict House limitations on federally financed abortions, the Senate voted today for a more liberal policy, assuring another Senate‐House confrontation on the eve of a planned 10‐day Thanksgiving recess by the House. At stake in the abortion dispute is an emergency appropriation bill to continue financing various Government departments and programs after Tuesday. For it was to this bill, which passed the Senate today by a vote of 80 to 10, that the Senate and House have attached their varying positions on use of Federal funds for terminating pregnancies. The Senate and House negotiators will meet tomorrow in much the same crisis atmosphere that prevailed a month ago when Congress, after weeks of deadlock, finally passed an emergency money bill that expires on Tuesday. Failure of the Senate‐House conferees to reach agreement on the new emergency bill before the House recess starting Saturday could halt temporary financing for the Departments of Defense, Transportation, Interior, Labor, and Health, Education and Welfare, and for military construction and foreign assistance programs. The bill would permit these departments and programs, whose regular appropriation bills have not yet cleared Congress, to continue spending at levels of the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. As passed by the House earlier this week, the temporary financing bill would limit use of Federal funds for abortions to those cases in which a mother's life was endangered. But the Senate, traditionally more liberal than the House on this issue, voted today, 57 to 36, to broaden such abortion policy to include victims of rape and incest and cases in which two physicians certified that a woman's physical health would be impaired if the pregnancy was not terminated. The Senate stand is identical with language that was included in the regular Labor‐H.E.W. appropriation bill for the last fiscal year. But while the Senate insisted today on the more liberal abortion policy, an earlier key vote showed marked erosion in the strength of the Senate's pro‐abortion forces. The test came on a proposed amendment by Senator J. James Exon, Democrat of Nebraska, that would have limited federally financed abortions to those in which a mother's life is endangered and to duly reported cases of rape and incest. The Exon amendment was defeated by a vote of 49 to 44. This was far closer than the usual 2‐to‐1 margin by which the Senate, in past years, has rejected attempts to place stricter limitations on abortions. While divided over the abortion issue, several Senators complained that the House was giving them too little time to act on essential money bills."
CONGRESS APPROVES AN ABORTION ACCORD,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/17/archives/congress-approves-an-abortion-accord-with-house-set-to-start-a.html,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 16 — With the House poised to begin a 10‐day recess, Congress hastily passed an emergency money bill today after agreeing to a compromise on use of Federal funds for abortions. Approval came first in the House, by a standing vote of 155 to 63. Those who op pose abortion tried unsuccessfully for a roll‐call vote. Hours later, the Senate interrupted its debate on “windfall” oil profits to approve the money bill and the abortion compromise by, a vote of 57 to 23. The compromise; broader than what the House wanted but narrower than what the Senate wanted, would permit federally financed abortions when a mother's life was endangered and in cases of rape and incest. Disagreement over abortion policy had threatened for days to stall financing of several major programs on military construction and foreign assistance and of the Departments of Defense, Transportation, Interior. Labor, and Health, Education and Welfare. Last month Congress passed a similar emergency funding bill for those departments and programs whose own appropriations bills have not cleared the House and Serrate, but the emergency period expires next Tuesday. The new measure, including the abortion compromise, is to be in effect until Sept. 30), 1980, or until regular appropriations bills can be passed. Averting Possible Slowdowns Had the Senate and House not acted today there could have been some slowdown in the activities of the departments and programs, with the members of the House away all next week. At first, the House conferees stood firm for abortion only when a mother's life was endangered. The Senate conferees were equally firm for inclusion of cases in which two physicians certified that a mother's physical health would be impaired lithe pregnancy was not terminated. “Well, we're back to the same old arguments,ȁ Senator Warren G. Magnuson, ments,ȁ Senator Warren G. Magnuson, Democrat of Washington, said. “Is there any chance the Senate will recede?” asked Representative Jamie L. Whitten, Democrat of Mississippi. “Oh, no, no,” Mr. Magnuson replied. Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, grinned and said, “Let me get out of this before the fist fight starts.” A bare majority of the 435‐member House was on hand for the debate and vote in midafternoon. Many members had already left town for the holiday. Those present, many of them anxious about their plane reservations, shouted “vote,” vote,” as the brief debate got under lay. Meanwhile, the way seemed clear for both houses to agree on an overall budget for the fiscal year 1980. The Senate, which had demanded that the budget resolution setting income and spending ceilings contain a formal order directing Congress to cut $3.6 billion from money bills, approved a “sense‐of‐Congress’ resolution that all committees should live within the budget ceiling. The House is expected to accept the Senate proposal."

A Government spokesman, stressing that Mr. Blunt was not a fugitive from justice, said the warning was “common courtesy.” But many people were shocked by the decision, and by the dislcosure that Lord Hume, who was Prime Minister in 1964 when Mr. Blunt secretly confessed to espionage, had not been told of the confession or of the Government decision to grant him immunity from prosecution.

The Region,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/18/archives/the-region-in-summary-gibson-and-council-in-a-showdown-over-extra.html,"Two weeks ago, after a petition drive led by a former candidate for mayor in crime‐conscious Newark, the City Council adopted an ordinance it had rejected earlier, setting a minimum of 1,200 patrol officers for the city's police force, about 250 above the current level. Last week, explaining that it was a matter of simple arithmetic, Mayor Kenneth A. Gibson, who opposed the ordinance, ordered layoff notices sent to 775 city employees. Their jobs, he said, would have to be sacrificed if the extra policemen are hired. He also vetoed the ordinance, indicating that if the City Council lets the veto stand, the layoffs will become unnecessary. He said Newark was faced with a $4 million budget deficit even before the police ordinance was passed. Without compensating cutbacks in other areas, he said, hiring 250 police officers and also supervisory personnel would add $9 million to the deficit. Leaders of the city's employee unions said neither the Mayor's arithmetic nor his motives were simple. “It's definitely a ploy,” said Thomas Possumato, president of the Fraternal Order of Police, who accused Mr. Gibson of “trying to pit one union against the other.” Others suggested he was using the threat of mass layoffs to force the City Council to accept his veto. The Council passed the ordinance 6‐0, with three abstentions. Presumably, Mr. Gibson can avoid an override by winning the support of one of the six. N.J. Would Tighten Rules on Abortion As in Washington, many states still cannot resolve the abortion controversy. The New Jersey Senate, after nearly three hours of emotional debate, last week passed, 27 to 9, a bill that — depending on point of view would either tighten state regulation of abortion or subject women seeking them to “harassment.” The law would require doctors to inform women seeking abortions of the “inherent” dangers in the procedure and advise them of alternatives, such as adoption. In addition, a woman would have to wait 24 hours after giving her “informed consent” to actually have an abortion and would require doctors to inform parents of pregnant teen‐agers 24 hours before performing abortions on them. The Assembly passed essentially the same bill last summer by a vote of 51 to 17. However, the Senate made several amendments which require concurrence b the Assembly before the measure can go to Gov. Brendan T. Byrne. Whether the Governor would sign the measure was uncertain, but the margins of passage in both houses suggested a veto could be overridden. A Health Plan For the Schools One reason New York's public schools are failing in their educational mission, critics have charged, is that they have been assigned too many noneducational “baby‐sitting” tasks. Last week, going against such criticism, the New York State Board of Regents recommended that the schools begin providing medical care. “A child that is ill is not ready to learn at his fullest capacity,” said Dr. Joseph R. Bongiorno of Brooklyn, a Regent who led a two‐year study of health services in the New York City schools. The study indicated that “not even a minimal health service program exists” and Dr. Bongiorno noted that such programs already exist in Scandinavian and British schools, as well as in the Soviet Union. The Regents said that, ultimately, each school should establish a clinic, staffed full‐time by trained health aides and part‐time by doctors and nurses from local hospitals. The clinics would provide immunizations and physical examinations, unless parents chose to use private physicians. More immediately, the Regents suggested pilot projects next year in the South Bronx and in Brooklyn's Bedford‐Stuyvesant section, poor areas without adequate existing health care. Dr. Bongiorno said 24 health aides trained under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act would be available full‐time for the programs. Dr. Bongiorno said the Koch administration, the Board of Education, the teachers union and the city's hospitals all were enthusiastic about the proposals. However, Governor Carey's administration appeared reluctant, he said, apparently because of fears that costs under Medicaid, which would cover expenses for children from poor families, might soar. The price tag? No one was even guessing. Down to Nitty‐Gritty On City Finances New York City's 1975 fiscal crisis, although acute, was just the first jolt of what many now recognize as a prolonged period of shrinking pains. Last week, more sounds of that anguish issued from offices and conference rooms where officials struggled to squeeze the giant needs of the city into its economy budget. The immediate issue was the Board of Education budget, but in the background were contract negotiations next year with the city's municipal employee unions. On Monday, leaders of the city's four uniformed services police, fire, sanitation and corrections — announced they would take on the city together in negotiations which, they said, should begin immediately. Their demands: a 16 percent pay increase in each year of a two‐year contract, plus cost‐of‐living raises. Last week, after the City Council leadership and the Board of Estimate had rejected a cost‐cutting plan worked out by Mayor Koch and School Chancellor Frank J. Macchiarola, the Board of Education took the unprecedented step of asking the city's top elected officials to work with its members in devising cuts that would pass muster. And the elected officials, in dealing with the financial problem, were factoring in political considerations — the outcry by citizens upset with school cutbacks. Edward L. Sadowsky, chairman of the Council's Finance Committee, explained why the Macchiarola‐Koch plan was turned down: “We rejected the cuts because we would like to see cuts in administrative costs, rather than teacher layoffs.” Trade‐In Would Aid N.Y. Mass Transit New York City's mass‐transit advocates got the good news last week of the unanimous approval by the House Public Works and Transportation Committee of a $75 million grant that had been earmarked for repairs to the Long Island Expressway. New Jersey got a similar piece of welcome news when the committee gave the state permission to take $40 million previously intended for approaches to the Lincoln Tunnel and use it for mass transit. The bill will now go to the full House, which might be expected to pass it quickly in view of the committee's unanimity. Passage in the Senate is expected to be complicated by New York's two members, Jacob K. Javits and Daniel P. Moynihan, who said they would insist on the restoration of the original, considerably larger, pretrade‐in amounts. The bill had been blocked in the House committee by concern over establishing a precedent for subsequent swaps of highway funds from existing Interstates like the L.I. Expressway for mass transit. In this sense, Manhattan's Westway still has a chance for trade‐in funds because it hasn't been built yet. Thirteen trade‐ins for new Interstates have already taken place. But the House committee put in a provision asserting an intent by Congress for a one‐shot agreement. Young Good Drivers To Get a Break Throughout the country, youthful automobile drivers have trouble buying insurance without paying steep premiums, despite good driving records. A small inroad was made on their behalf in Connecticut last week when Motors Insurance Corporation, a New‐York‐based company, inaugurated just such a change in its rating system — although, for now, it involves only 2,000 Connecticut drivers. The differences in rates are substantial. John J. MacDonald, president of the carrier, said that for a single male driver under 25, the premiums will be 55 percent lower than those of other companies, if the insured is a safe driver. As drivers continue with the plan, their premiums will be reduced by 5 percent for each claim‐free year, up to a maximum of 25 percent. Average premiums will be cut by 15.3 percent, he said. George Martynuk, a spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute, said he was not wholly pleased with such a plan. In the three other states where age, sex and marital status have been eliminated by law as rate factors, he said, “we go into socialized insurance with subsidization of younger drivers by older.” Alvin Davis and Don Wyatt"
FEMINISM TAKES ANEW TURN,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/18/archives/feminism-takes-a-new-turn-feminism.html,"In California last month, I went into the office of a television producer who prides himself on being an “equal opportunity employer.” His new “executive assistant” was waiting for me. She wanted to talk to me alone before her boss came in. Lovely, in her late 20's or maybe 30‐ish, “dressed for success” like a model in the latest Vogue advertisement, she was not just a glorified secretary with a fancy title in a deadend job: The woman she replaced had just been promoted to the position of “creative vice president.” “I know I'm lucky to have this job,” she said. “But you people who fought for these things had your families. You already had your men and children. What are we supposed to do?” She complained that the older woman vice president, an early radical feminist who had vowed never to marry or have children, didn't understand her quandary. “All she wants,” the executive assistant said, “is more power in the company….” A young woman in her third year of Harvard Medical School told me, “I'm going to be a surgeon. I'll never be trapped housewife like my mother. would like to get married and have children, 1 think. They say we can have it all. But how? I work 36 hours in the hospital, 12 off. How am I going lo have a relationship, much less kids, with hours like that? I'm not sure 1 can be a superwoman.” In New York, a woman in her 30's who has just been promoted says, “I'm up against the clock, you might say. If don't have a child now, it will he too late. But it's an agonizing choice. I've been supporting my husband while he gets his Ph.D. We don't know what kind of job he'll be able to get. There's no pay when you take off to have a baby in my company. They don't guarantee you'll get your job back. If I don't have a baby, will I miss out on life somehow? Will I really be fulfilled as a woman?” An older woman in Ohio reflects, “I was the first woman manager here. gave everything to the job. It was exciting at first, breaking in where women never were before. Now, it's just a job. But it's the devastating loneliness that's the worst. I can't stand coming back to this apartment alone every night. I'd like a house, maybe a garden. Maybe I should have a kid, even without a father. At least then I'd have a family. There has to be some better way to live. A woman alone.…” With the same mix of shock and relief with which the women's movement began in the 1960's, feminists at the end of the 1970's are moving to a new frontier: the family. Another corner in history is turned, I believe, with the convening of a National Assembly on the Future of the Family by the N.O.W. Legal Defense and Education Fund at the New York Hilton tomorrow. It's hardly new for women to be concerned with the family. But aren't feminists supposed to be liberating themselves from the family? Isn't the women's movement supposed to be trying to destroy the family with the Equal Rights Amendment? And isn't the family, after all, the last bastion of conservatism? Is the women's movement surrendering, then, to the forces of reaction by retreating to the family? Or is feminism truly entering a new stage? I think, in fact, that the women's movement has come just about as far as we can in terms of women alone. When I think back to the explosion of the women's movement at the opening of the decade — thousands of women marching down Fifth Avenue on Aug. 26, 1970 on that first nationwide women's strike for equality, carrying banners for “Equal Rights to Jobs and Education,” “The Right to Abortion,” “24 Hour Child Care” and “Political Power to the Women” — our agenda then seems so simple and straightforward. Ten years later, though the women's movement has changed all our lives and our daughters take their own personhood and equality for granted, they — and we — are finding that it's not so easy to live with — or without — men and children solely on the basis of that first feminist agenda. The great challenge we face in the 1980's is to frame a new agenda that makes it possible for women to be able to work and love in equality with men — and to choose, if they so desire, to have children. For the choices we have sought in the 70's are not as simple as they once seemed. Indeed, some of the choices women are supposed to have won by now are not real choices at all. And even the measure of equality we have already achieved is not secure until we face these unanticipated conflicts between the demands of the workplace and professional success on the one hand, and the demands of the family on the other. These conflicts seem insoluble because of the way the family and workplace have been structured in America. The second feminist agenda, the agenda for the 80's, must call for the restructuring of the institutions of home and work. But to confront the American family as it actually is today—instead of hysterically defending or attacking the family that is no more, “the classical family of Western nostalgia,” as Stanford sociologist William J. Goode calls it — means shattering an image that is still sacred to both church and state, to politicians on the right and left. And dispelling the mystique of the family may be even more threatening to some than unmasking the feminine mystique was a decade ago. For instance, a White House Conference on Families was supposed to have been held this year, but it was suddenly canceled as too “controversial” when the experts assembled to plan it began facing the facts about American families today. The flak started when participating Catholic priests discovered that the eminent black woman coordinating the conference was herself divorced and raising her family as a single parent. And when it was revealed that fewer than 7 percent of Americans are now living in the kind of family arrangement to which politicians are always paying lip service — daddy‐the‐breadwinner, mother — the — housewife, two children plus a dog and a cat — the White House decided to call the whole thing off. According to Government statistics, only 17 percent of American households include a father who is the sole wage earner, a mother who is a fulltime homemaker, and one or more children. (And one study found that one‐third of all such full‐time housewives planned to look for jobs.) 28 percent of American households consist of both a father and a mother who are wage earners, with one or more children living at home. 32.4 percent of American households consist of married couples with no children, or none living at home. 6.6 percent of American households are headed by women who are single parents with one or more children at home. 0.7 percent are headed by men who are single parents with one or more children at home. 3.1 percent consist of unrelated persons living together. 5.3 percent are headed by a single parent and include relatives other than spouses and children. 22 percent of Amercian households consist of one person living alone (a third of these are women over 65). As Muriel Fox, president of N.O.W.'s Legal Defense and Education Fund, put it in her charge to the Family Assembly discussion leaders: “Our assembly will accept — rather than deny — the fact that 93 percent of American families today fit patterns other than the traditional one of a breadwinning father, a homemaking mother and two or more dependent children. We will accept the inevitability of continuing future change in the relationships and roles of men, women and children within families. And we will seek new responses to the conditions that are cause and effect of such change. “We do not share the frequently voiced opinion that American families are in state of hopeless collapse. People are living together in new combinations for the intimacy and support that constitute a family — unmarried adults with or without children, single‐parent families, multigenerational communes, various new groupings of the elderly. “The future of the family is an overriding feminist issue.” When feminists proclaimed “the right to choose” a decade ago, we meant the right for woman to decide whether or when to have a child and to control her own reproductive process — a more basic right, as the Supreme Court ruled, than many of those spelled out in the Bill of Rights by and for men. Lately, feminists upholding “the right to choose” have been fighting a desperate holding battle against the “right to life” or “pro‐family” forces whom politicians from President Carter on down have tried to appease by barring Medicaid funds for poor women needing abortions. But what is beginning to concern me even more today are the conflicts women now suffer as they reach 30 or 35 and cannot choose to have a child. I don't envy young women who are facing or denying that agonizing choice we won for them. Because it isn't really a free choice when their paycheck is needed to cover the family bills each month, when women must look to their jobs and professions for the security and status their mothers once sought in marriage alone, and when these professions are not structured for people who give birth to children and take responsibility for their upbringing. My own feminism began in outrage at the either/or choice that the feminine mystique imposed on my generation. I was fired from my job as a reporter when I became pregnant. Most of us let ourselves be seduced into giving up our careers in order to embrace motherhood, and it wasn't easy to resume them. We told our daughters that they could — and should—have it all. Why not? After all, men do. But the “superwomen” who are trying to “have it all,” combining full‐time careers and “stretch‐time” motherhood, are enduring such relentless pressure that their younger sisters may not even dare to think about having children. The many women struggling with the conflict between careers and children cannot be dismissed as victims of their mother's expectations, of the feminine mystique. Motherhood, the profound human impulse to have children, is more than a mystique. At the same time, more women than ever before hold jobs not just because they want to “find themselves” and assert their independence, but because they must. They are single and responsible for their own support, divorced and often responsible for their children's support as well, or married and still partly responsible for their families’ support because one paycheck is not enough in this era of inflation. In all, 43 percent of American wives with children under the age of 6 are working today, and by 1990, it is estimated that 64 percent will have jobs — only one out of three mothers, approximately, will be housewife at home. Yet the United States is one of the few advanced nations with no national policy of leaves for maternity, paternity or parenting, no national policy encouraging flexible working arrangements and part‐time and shared employment, and no national policy to provide child care for those who need it. It seems almost obscene, as the United Nations’ “Year of the Child” draws to a close, that the United States, the richest of all nations, should be spending less on child‐care programs now than it did 10 years ago. But, all in the name of “preserving the family,” Presidents, both Democratic and Republican, have ignored the need for such services, available to parents at all income levels, as they are in countries much poorer than ours, with a sliding scale of fees according to a family's ability to pay. Dr. Sheila B. Kamerman, professor of social policy and social planning at the Columbia University School of Social Work, investigated the childcare arrangements of 200 white and black mothers, half of them professional or executive women, the other half lowpaid, unskilled workers, all of them working full time, with at least one child under the age of 5 to care for. According to Dr. Kamerman, their children “may experience three, four or even more kinds of care in an average week, as they spend a part of the day in nursery school, another part with a family day‐care mother (or two different such women) and are brought to and from these services by a parent, a neighbor, or some other per“Aside from the difficulty of obtaining good child care, the greatest difficulty for these women is the rigidity and unresponsiveness of the workplace. Beginning hours at a job often conflict with conventional school opening times; the lack of any benefits for maternity leaves, or for sick leaves to care for an ill child, creates financial and emotional stress for families dependent on the income of two wage earners.” Confronting the crisis in child care; the Family Assembly is dispensing with rhetoric and theoretical arguments in favor of concrete proposals: new options, child‐care solutions that have worked in other countries, child‐care services that could be provided by a company or union in the actual workplace, home‐based child care, commercial child‐care services. The Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union, for instance, has been writing into union contracts provisions for a well‐run childcare nursery on factory premises as a basic employee benefit. The Stride Rite Corporation has been running such a child‐care center at its Boston plant for eight years now, and parents who live nearby but do not work at the plant can use the facility, too. In Alabama, a community center for senior citizens doubles as a childcare center. Another new concept is a “neighborhood network,” a volunteer referral service whereby families pass on to new parents child‐care arrangements that have worked for them. Dispensing with the obsolete question of whether or not women should work, the Family Assembly is also trying to “balance the demands of workplace and family.” Officials of A.T.&T., American Can Company and industry's Committee for Economic Development have joined Stanford sociologist William J. Goode and Caroline Bird, author of “The Two‐Paycheck Marriage,” in proposing “work‐pattern innovations” to preserve “the quality of family life in an industrial and postindustrial society [in which] home and job can no longer be regarded as separate worlds.” More and more companies are finding that “flextime” actually increases productivity and profits while reducing absenteeism. “Flextime” is the new system whereby everyone works at the office or factory during a midday core of hours, but arranges starting, leaving and lunch times according to individual needs. Some mothers and fathers start work at 10 A.M., after dropping their kids off at school ; others skip lunch hour and leave at 3 to be home after school; others do a week's work in four days in order to have a long weekend for themselves. American Can, for instance, even provides “flexible benefits” —health‐insurance, vacation and sick‐leave packages tailored to individual family It seems clear to me that we will never bring about these changes in the workplace, so necessary for the welfare of children and the family, if their only supporters and beneficiaries are women. The need for such innovations becomes urgent as more and more mothers enter the workplace, but they will come about only because more and more fathers demand them, too. And men are beginning to demand them already. After all, they've long been subject to the same pressures that increasing numbers of women are experiencing. A Vietnam veteran, laid off unexpectedly during the energy crunch by the airline with which he thought he had a lifetime career, tells me, “There's no security in a job. The dollar's not worth enough anymore to live your life for. I'll work three days a week at the boiler plant and my wife will go back to nursing nights, and between us we'll take care of the kids. We're moving to where we can raise our own food and have some control over our lives. But what if she gets laid off?” “I thought seriously of killing myself,” says a St. Louis man who was forced to resign at the age of 50 when the company he headed was taken over by a large conglomerate. “I saved up the arsenic pills I take for my heart condition. How could I live without that company to run, my office, my staff, 600 employees, the wheeling and dealing? But then I realized how much of it I'd really hated: the constant worry, getting in at 6 A.M. to read the reports of six vice presidents, fighting the union to keep wages down and being hated, and knuckling under to people I despised to get accounts. The only good thing was knowing I'd made it to president of a company, when my father never got past stock clerk. Now I want to work for myself, to live, to enjoy the sunsets and raise begonias. But my kids are gone now, and my wife started her career late, and all she wants is to get ahead in the agency. It's unthinkable somehow, what's ahead in life….” A younger man in Rhode Island quit his job at a bank totake care of the house and kids and to paint at home, while his wife, sick of being a housewife, was happy to get a lesser job at the same bank. “I think you're going to see a great wave of men dropping out,” he told me. “All we've been hearing for years now is, ‘What does it mean being a woman? How can she fulfill herself?’ But what does it mean being a man? What do we have but our jobs? Let her support the family for a while, and let me find myself.…” A young man refuses an extra assignment, which would mean working nights and traveling weekends, on top of his regular job. It doesn't matter that it might lead to a big promotion. “We're having another child,” he tells his boss, “and I'm committed to sharing the responsibilities at home because my wife's going to law school at night. It hasn't and won't interfere with my job — you were more than satisfied with my last report. But I'm not taking on anything extra. My family is more important to me.” “That man isn't going to get far,” his puzzled boss tells a colleague. “Too bad: He was the pick of the litter.” The colleague asks, “What if they all start acting like that? Where are we going to find the men to run the economy, for God's sake, if they all start putting their families first?” As we move into the 1980's, it becomes clearer that the women's movement has been merely the beginning of something much more basic than a few women getting good (men's) jobs. Paradoxically, as more women enter the workplace and share the breadwinning, their family bonds and values — human values as opposed to material ones — seem to strengthen. The harassed working mothers and their husbands in Dr. Kamerman's study of families place more importance and reliance on these bonds, not only with each other and their own children but with their own parents and other relatives, than do comparable families conforming to the traditional housewife‐breadwinner image. The increasing tendency for young men to refuse corporate transfers and to put more emphasis on their self‐fulfillment and “family time” as opposed to “getting ahead” has been reported by Yankelovich, Gail Sheehy in Esquire and even Playboy magazine. When his wife is also earning money and his identity and standard of living do not depend entirely on his paycheck, a husband is something more than just a company man. Such a man has more freedom and opportunity to develop human values and to share the reality and responsibility of parenting. The Wall Street Journal reports that, of 300 recently relocated executives surveyed by a Chicago management‐consulting firm, the great majority said that their most important consideration was not the job itself but “winning family consent.” “Tomorrow Begins Today,” a study issued by the Security Pacific National Bank of Los Angeles, states, “Currently, 80 percent of all families earning 520,000 or more are two‐wageearner families…. Two‐wage earners place less emphasis on careers and increased value on leisure activities, child care and household services. Career roles are less instrumental than the search for selfidentity and good health.” Ah, yes — good health. One of the most remarkable results of the women's movement has been the unprecedented new vitality and growth experienced by millions of women who have defied the deterioration, depression and despair that used to be considered “normal” symptoms of aging in women. Twenty years ago, the mental health and general wellbeing of women were much worse than those of men in every age group after 20. Today, however, a repeal of the famous Mid‐Manhattan Study shows that women no longer deteriorate in middle age. Indeed, women aged 40 and 50 are just as healthy as trey were in their 20's and 30's, and much healthier than middle‐aged women were 20 years ago. But such improvement has not been noted among men. The scientists who conducted these studies suspect that a crucial factor was the women's movement. It seems to have been a fountain of youth for women as we have moved to our new self‐respect and put new energies and new talents to use, directing our aggression outward, even when the obstacles have been tough, instead of inward, against our own bodies, as despairing women used to do after their early peak of marriage and childbearing. The widening discrepancy between men's life expectancy and women's — now roughly 77 years for women, 69 for men — makes it urgent that men break through their conventional sex roles as so many women have. Some men are already doing so, and the increasing awareness of men's midlife crises may be a harbinger of more changes to come. Furthermore, the discrepancy should alert women to the dangers of adopting too closely the obsessive careerism that has made so many men die prematurely of stressinduced heart attacks and strokes. Unfortunately, according to Dr. Alexander Leaf, Chief of Medical Services at Massachusetts General Hospital, more young women than ever before are being admitted there with heart attacks, though hard data are not yet available nationally. And cancer experts have been noticing lately that as more young men stop smoking, more young women are starting. ('You've Come a Long Way, Baby!”) A repeat of a massive mentalhealth survey originally conducted 15 years ago by the National Center for Health Statistics shows that today more women in their 20's and 30's are suffering from stress. Women's equality will have been for nothing if its beneficiaries, by trying to beat men at their own old power games and aping their strenuous climb onto and up the corporate ladder, fall into the traps men are beginning to escape. The young men of the “counterculture” of the 1960's and 70's were rebelling against the great pressures to devite their whole lives to money‐making careers — just as women in the feminist movement rebelled against the great pressures to devote their whole lives to husbands and children and to forego personal advancement. But to substitute one half of a loaf for the other is not an improvement. Why should women simply replace the glorification of domesticity with the glorification of work as their life and identity? Simply to reverse the roles of breadwinner and homemaker is no progress at all, not for women and not for men. The challenge of the 80's will be to transcend these polarities by creating new family patterns based on equality and full human identity for both sexes. The willingness, finally, of the modern women's movement to come to grips with the practical problems of the family has inestimable historical significance. Reviewing the history of the original feminist movement and why it failed to alter the lives of most American women, historian William O'Neill in his book, “Everyone Was Brave,” concluded that the trouble was rooted in the movement's unwillingness to tackle the problems of the family. Most of the early American feminists were either young single women opposed to marriage and the family or else married professional women who didn't have children or preferred to concentrate on loftier issues, such as the vote. They assumed that winning suffrage would automatically usher in equality and purify society. Yet, wrote O'Neill, since the masses of American women were married or wanted to be, the only way that equality between the sexes could have been achieved was through a “revolution in domestic life” reconciling the demands of family and career —a revolution that the first feminists never attempted — which is why they fizzled out after the vote was won in 1920. A few years ago, it looked as if the same thing might happen again. The popular (and unpopular) image of the modern feminist was that of a career “superwoman” hellbent on beating men at their own game, or of young “Ms. Libber,” agitating against marriage, motherhood, sexual intimacy with men, and any and all of the traits with which women in the past pleased or attracted men. But the nine founding mothers of N.O.W. who are participating in the Assembly on the Future of the Family preached a feminism that was always rooted in personal truth. For us to have ignored or attacked men and families would have been a lie. We averaged more than two children apiece. Men were members of N.O.W. from the very beginning. Muriel Fox, a high‐powered publicrelations executive, brought her two kids along to N.O.W.'s founding conference in 1966, and her surgeon husband put them to bed in the hotel while she stayed up all night getting out our first press release. The feminists who have followed us in the movement's mainstream speak today of their own evolving families. Eleanor Smeal, the brilliant housewife president of N.O.W., found that commuting between Washington and her family in Pittsburgh didn't work, so her metallurgist husband and two children will join her. He will It seems to me you can trust feminists — or any other “‐ists,” for that matter—only when they speak from personal truth in all its complexity. Such truth is never black or white. The image of “women's lib” as being opposed to the family was encouraged by women locked in violent reaction against their own families and identities. Their anger was real enough, but their rhetoric denied other elements of their personal truth. When extremists — both feminists and antifeminists—perpetrate the myth that equality means death to the family, other women have a hard time figuring out what their real options are — and their own real feelings. So Phyllis Schlafly and Marabel Morgan make a lot of money pursuing their own careers, going around the country lecturing women that they don't need equal rights, just husbands to support them—which they'll allegedly stop doing when the Equal Rights Amendment is passed. But the underlying reality is no different for the bitterest feminists and most stridently fearful defenders of the family. None of us can depend throughout our new, long lives on that “family of Western nostalgia” to meet our needs for nurture and supbut all of still have those needs. The answer is not to deny them, but to recognize and strengthen new family forms that can sustain us now. In the years since my divorce, I seem to have created a new extended family that consists not only of my own children but also of friends on whom I can always depend for a bed and a loving ear. Although I live alone in my little house in Sag Harbor, my family stretches from California to Cambridge. And there is an authentic note of family reunion as we who founded N.O.W. a generation ago reconvene for the Assembly on the Future of the Family, our sons and daughters at our sides, our hands extended to men. As our children grow up and leave home, as more of us struggle with the problems of husbands’ strokes and heart attacks, and our own illnesses and loneliness, we admit our needs and vulnerabilities to each other. We get love and support from this family that was knit together in our battle for equality. The movement itself has become “family,” and now we call each other longdistance just to say “hello” as My personal concern for the 1980's is the possibility of and need for new patterns of intimacy and growth, love and work in the third of life that most women — but not yet most men — can now hope to enjoy after 50. What social policies and institutional innovations will enable us more easily to enjoy vital, integrative lives after childbearing, making our own professional and personal choices, and receiving as well as giving family support to each other and our children? As our population becomes proportionately older, the dominant social revolution of the 1980's will almost certainly be made by men and women in this new third of life. For they will be us, demanding our own voice and participation in society instead of the diminished opportunities, low status, dehumanizing discrimination and passive roles as patients that our society now imposes on the For instance, the assembly asked architects to come up with new kinds of communal housing for people who live alone and for older couples rattling around in drafty houses too big to keep up with the children gone — housing which provides everyone with her or his own private living space but also offers new kinds of shared space for eating, socializing and doing chores. There are also proposals for the same kind of mortgage financing now available only to young families, and for reeducation loans, like the G.I. Bill, for the new third of life after 50. Robert N. Butler, director of the National Institute on Aging, has been complaining for some time that most of our policies on aging are based on research conducted on men—and men in pathological decline, outside the family setting — whereas most of the people actually living in old age are women. There is some speculation that women survive better and longer than men because they forge more human and familylike connections even after childrearing. As more men share that early nurturing, will they also develop new survival skills? To some it may sound strange for a feminist like myself to be arguing so passionately for the importance of families. Such arguments have even been dismissed by some radical feminists as “reactionary family chauvinism.” But it may very well be that the family, which has always been considered the bastion of conservatism, is already somehow being transfformed by women's equality into a progressive political force. For when men start assigning a higher priority to their families and self‐fulfillment, and women a higher priority to independence and active participation in “man's world,” what happens to the supremacy of the corporate, bureaucratic system? Some recent management studies, for instance, indicate that the corporate policy of frequently transferring executives and demanding that they work nights and weekends is not really necessary for the work of the corporation, but that, by estranging them from their communities and families, it serves to make executives corporate creatures, “company men.” Will women renounce their bonds and their power within the family in order to become “company women”? Some already have, but in most instances, I women's equality, in the home and in the workplace, strengthens the family and enables it better to resist dehumanization. Families are easier to control when women are passive and dependent. One of the first acts of the Nazis when they took over Germany was to take away some of the rights of women. Can American capitalism accommodate a strengthened, evolving American family? Why not? Despite the rhetoric, the family has never ranked high on the American political and economic agenda, except as a unit to which to sell things. The business of America, as everyone knows, is business, and until recently it's been man's business. Now that women are beginning to have an active voice in the economy and politics, the nation's agenda may begin truly to include the family. Not just because women insist — they don't have that much power yet — but because men have a new stake in the family. The new sharing of parenting and the envy many men are beginning to express now of women's liberation suggest that the family, instead of being enemy territory to feminists, is really the underground through which secretly they reach into every man's life. The new urge of both women and men for meaning in their work and life, for love, roots and family — even though it may not resemble the ideal family that maybe never was — is a powerful I'm not even altogether sure that the women's movement as such will be the main agent of this next stage of human liberation. But if we don't want to retreat — with women and men withdrawing into tired, lonely disillusionment and backlash — we must somehow turn this new corner toward the family of the future. Women must now confront anew their own needs for love and comfort and caring support, as well as the needs of children and men, for whom, I believe, we cannot escape bedrock human responsibility."
The Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/18/archives/the-nation-in-summary-cautions-the-key-as-reagan-moves-into-the.html,"In New York City of all places, Ronald Reagan last week formally announced that he was once again after the Republican Presidential nomination. And for his first few days out in the open, the former California Governor's every word and deed seemed calculated to demonstrate that to be 68 years old is not to be infirm, that to be conservative is simply sensible. The New Reagan is clearly in hurry to nail down convention votes, even in those hotbeds of Eastern liberalism, the big northeastern cities that once shunned him. He swung through 12 of them in states that hold early primaries, before (like most of the Republican pack) scrambling for straw votes in Florida. With the traditional reluctance of front‐runners to share the limelight, he said he would not debate with the nine other candidates. Underlying the care and the caution was the knowledge that, if the polls are accurate, the nomination can at last be his unless he blows it. But the convention is eight months away, a long time for a man who in the past has had a quick verbal draw and learned to regret it. Last week, John B. Connally, who may have spent as much as $300,000 on the Florida straw vote, fired a carefully stitched pattern. He asserted in Pittsburgh that affirmative action programs are “divisively harmful in their effect.” An aide said his target, in large measure, had been the many Jewish members of the audience, and he had been trying to recoup after last month's outline of a Middle East peace plan that would, among other things, require Israel to return much of the territory it occupied in the 1967 war. Commercial Balance In Philip M. Klutznick, nominated last week to be Secretary of Commerce, the Administration will be getting three for one: an experienced businessman who has been an accomplished money raiser for Democratic political candidates and who has close ties with the American Jewish community. If confirmed, he will replace Juanita M. Kreps, who resigned for personal reasons on Nov. 1. While Mr. Klutznick could be a valuable electionyear addition to the Carter Cabinet, the fact that he was apparently not the White House's first choice underlined the President's uncertain standing. The House Says No On Hospital Costs Forewarned that the House of Representatives was in no mood to accept new Federal direction of anything, President Carter last week nonetheless pushed for a vote on standby controls on hospital costs. Afterwards, one of Mr. Carter's most highly sought anti‐inflation measures was ready for the morgue. The Administration's chief spokesman dismissed the voluntary controls ultimately accepted by the House as “a joke,” and will try to revive its proposal in the Senate. The prognosis isn't good there either. According to one Representative, the specter of a “bureaucratic monstrosity” was scarier than any backlash from constituents. They rarely see the effect of hospital cost inflation because few of them pay their bills directly — and so presumably wouldn't appreciate the $41 billion savings the White House claimed an 11.6 percent ceiling on rising nationwide hospital costs would bring over the next four years. The current rate of increase is about 19 percent. House Democratic leaders, anticipating defeat, wanted the vote posponed. But the White House was apparently afraid that the outlook would be even worse when Representatives returned from their Thanksgiving break, exposed to more lobbying by their hometown doctors and hospital boards of directors. Old Order Changeth In Labor Movement George Meany, for nearly a quarter century the warrior patriach of organized labor, formally stepped down last week. In his valediction, one thing was clear. He had no regrets. Having been a working man's leader, the 85‐yearold president told the 1,000 delegates assembled for the 13th biennial convention of the 13.6‐million‐member American Federation of Labar‐Congress of Industrial Organizations, was “the highest honor that could be paid any human being.” Mr. Meany's chosen successor — to be elected this week — is Lane Kirkland, not a working man, but a career technician, for the past ten years the federation's secretary‐treasurer. There is, however, continuity in the change. Mr. Kirkland, like most of the 33 union presidents on the A.F.L.C.I.O. executive council, shares Mr. Meany's views. But organized labor is not the same. It currently represents only than one‐quarter of the American workforce, and its fastest growing sector is service and governmental workers, not the crafts and trades such as Mr. Meany's plumber's union. A less equable change came to the 220,000‐member United Mine Workers, whose legendary John L. Lewis led the drive to organize mass‐production industry in the 1930's. Arnold R. Miller, elected president as a reformer in 1972, resigned in the face of an almost certain move to depose him because of his failing health and recent erratic behavior. In a transition secretly negotiated with Mr. Miller at his hospital bed, Sam Church Jr., the union's vice president who had become the de facto leader, took the title of president. ‘Windfall’ Tax Bill Passes First Test It was only a test vote, but President Carter's “windfall” profits levy last week was off (finally) in the Senate, to not a bad start, with the defeat of an attempt to decrease, from 60 percent to 50 percent, the rate at which the House would tax oil industry earnings. The 53‐32 vote came after the amemdment's sponsor, Senator David L. Boren, Democrat of Oklahoma, said he wanted “a clear indication” of “the direction [the Senate] wants to take.” All anyone really learned, however, was that the Senate wouldn't favor the oil industry that much. In fact, proindustry members professed satisfaction; they read the roll‐call as a sign that the Senate's “windfall” legislation, which is only half as taxing as the House's, would not be strengthened. White House lobbyists were making no predictions. Among the 32 members voting yes were eight Democrats, five from oil producing states. Senate debate is expected to last for weeks. It began after a legislative impasse (two committees had produced bills) on next year's home‐heating aid to the poor had been broken. The compromise is slightly more favorable to the colder Northern states. Abortion Aid Survives Again Weariness, added to uncertainty about continued Government operations, combined at the 11th hour last week to produce yet another uneasy truce on one of the decade's more bitterly fought issues — Federal financing of abortions. As usual, both sides gave a little. And as usual, the compromise — permitting the procedure when a mother's life is endangered and in cases of rape or incest — was broader than the House would like and too restrictive for the Senate. Abortion limits had been attached to appropriations bills for four Federal departments, including Defense. An emergency measure to tide them over was due to expire this Tuesday; the House was due to go on Thanksgiving holiday last Friday. After jostling all week, the compromise, permitting the departments to opetate at current levels until next October, was struck late that day. Congress Gangs Up To Curb the F.T.C. When the House of Representatives last week told the Federal Trade Commission that it could not require funeral homes to quote prices over the telephone, it wasn't an endorsement for undertakers. It was another manifestation of the declining clout of the consumer movement. And the House is not through with the commission, increasingly criticized for too vigorously telling a range of corporations how to behave and for being overly independent of Congress. Last week it voted to make the commission shelve proposed funeral‐industry regulations. After its holiday break, the House is likely to accept a committee recommendation that Congress should give itself veto authority over future rulings of the independent executive agency — no small shift in the balance of powers. Yet other swipes may come from the once sympathetic Senate. This week, a Senate committee is scheduled to take up restrictions on the commission that would, among other things, required to the F.T.C. to drop its review of advertising on children's television programming. President Carter and the commission's shrinking corps of defenders in Congress have warned that the proposed restrictions, if enacted, would all but end the commission's ability to protect consumers.

Colombians Vigorously Debate Abortion Proposal,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/18/archives/colombians-vigorously-debate-abortion-proposal.html,"Special to The New York Times BOGOTA, Colombia — A vigorous debate has arisen here over abortion, an issue seldom if ever confronted publicly in South America. The encounter has followed the introduction in Congress of bill permitting abortion in certain restricted cases. Ninety‐five percent of the Colombian population of well over 25 million is Roman Catholic, and the Catholic Church has mounted a full‐scale campaign, enlisting parishioners in the fight against the measure. Under it, abortion would be permitted during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy in cases of rape or of a medical determination that the birth could endanger the life or “mental or physical health” of the mother. Abortion at later stages would be allowed if evidence emerged that the fetus was “gravely malformed.” In addition to citing moral objections, the church has denounced the proposal on two secular grounds: that it runs afoul of human rights doctrine and that it violates the constitutional clause that enjoins Congress from approving any form of the death penalty. “The opposition is better organized than we expected,” said a member of Congress, Consuelo Lleras de Samper, daughter of former President Alberto Lleras Camargo and the author of the legislation. At the same time she noted that it had 80 co‐sponsors and said that “of the people who have spoken out, there appears to be an even division of opinion, and that's more than we hoped for at first.” Under present law a woman who undergoes an abortion faces one to four years in jail and a doctor performing an abortion loses his right to practice and faces up to six years’ imprisonment. The only exception falls under the title “honoris causa” — a peculiarly Latin American provision that permits the reduction or suspension of penalties in cases where an abortion is performed to save the honor of a husband or father. It is estimated that 250,000 Colombians have abortions annually. For those who can afford them, safe clandestine operations are available for $350. Among those who go to cheaper practitioners or who minister to themselves the death rate is 1,500 a year, according to statistics compiled by Profamilia, a largely foreignthRgiout Colombia. Only other South American country that forbids abortion is Bolivia. Elsewhere selected “therapeutic” abortions are permitted to protect those whose lives would be endangered. Colombia, though party to a concordat with the Vatican that allows it special governmental privileges, has instituted civil marriage and civil divorce over the last decade and has permitted widespread family planning despite church opposition. In the current debate the church is far more active. “We must present our total opposition, respectfully but publicly,” said Archbishop Augusto Trujillo Arango of the city of Tunja, in the neighboring province of Boyaca. “Induced abortion is always crime against human life, divine law and natural law, and the law now before Congress represents mottling else. Respect for life, from the first moment of concepMon, is the primary and fundamental 1 right of a human being.” IChildren have demonstrated outside ‘Congress with placards saying, “I have I the right to live,” “Don't kill me” and 1“Abortion is homicide.” A group of !graduates of Bogota's best women's schools issued a declaration asking, among other things, how hospitals could accommodate all those who would want I abortions when they could not handle present cancer and tuberculosis cases. Perhaps the most prominent opponent is Colombia's First Lady, Nydia Quintero de Turbay, a social activist who is associated with efforts to better the lot of thouI sands of abandoned children."
The Duke and the Shah,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/18/archives/the-duke-and-the-shah.html,"As a kid addicted to Saturday movie matinees in the late 1940's, I saw a Western in which John Wayne sacrificed himself to the Indians in order to save the others besieged in the fort. Details are fuzzy, but The Duke. a great American, as we have all been told, was not guilty of the dastardly murder for which the Indians demanded his life. He became a hero —though a dead one. He was not above martyrdom. Is it strange that no elements of this old scenario have surfaced in the present situation with the Shah? Most people agree he was responsible for thousands of deaths and great suffering while he ruled Iran — always, regrettably, with the complicity of his American allies. Could he now redeem himself — and incidentally cause the release of the 62 hostages — by voluntarily flying back in one of his jets, ill though he is? Could he in fact become a saint to some? Disease and death are truly horrible wherever and whomever they strike. The Shah is an aging man, sick and dying. Families suffer: wives arrayed in emeralds and diamonds or rags, children playing in Porsches or the gutter. But is it simple‐minded to ask why the Shah didn't fly to Switzerland —where he has a home and probably a few of those fabled numbered accounts — for treatment? Swiss medicine has surely progressed beyond the application of leeches. Were his overriding business interests in the United States the reason? Did and does he even have ultimate choice? In short, isn't the real issue the billions of dollars he drained from his country? To disentangle and return the loot would cause unconscionable suffering. Think of the politicians and oil men, the real‐estate developers and munitions manufacturers — to name only a few — who could not afford private schools for their children, sable coats for their wives and mistresses, private jets and private islands for their egos. There must be more than 62. Americans as a people do empathize with suffering and are willing to give anyone another chance. We witness genuine forgiveness every day on neighborhood or local level, but on larger stage disturbing questions abound. One leads to another; more questions clamor to be asked. To look back briefly: Was the proverbial man on the street really convinced that Richard M. Nixon had suffered enough or that the country wouldn't survive an impeachment trial? Today, are we wrong to be bored by his and his henchmen's self‐serving and lucrative memoirs while we must kick in for even his paper clips and erasers? Should we rejoice in what we are being offered for 1980: a mediocre and literally old movie star; a Tennessee Senator who supports a pork‐barrel dam no one except a few who profit want or need (the snail darter least of all); a Texan whose lack of qualifications boggles the mind; a Massachusetts Senator whose record of honesty at Harvard and Chappaquiddick is less than inspiring? At this rate, why not consider for President an unemployed Somoza, or the Shah, if he remains and recovers? Perhaps we'll soon have a candidate from El Salvador. As others before him, such refugee dictators will be welcomed heartily to our shores. Can it simply be that they mix well at parties and know the latest light‐bulb jokes? But surely all these men suffer — in an awesome manner. And how we are forced to bleed and be bled in communion with the plight of the powerful! It is a wonder. Let poor and minority women, denied even a comparatively few dollars by government for an abortion, feel grateful. Why should Congress encourage their immorality when billions are to be spent and made off child welfare, child pornography, slum housing, drug‐dealing. And ultimately: Has anyone noted the correlation between those against abortion yet in favor of the death penalty? How convoluted morality! How strong the voice of one man — if your name happens to be David R.Rockefeller or Henry A. Kissinger, who helped bring the Shah to New York. How impotent that of many: at the extreme, the Jews who faced extinction in ovens that continued their grim work while bombs fell miraculously all around — but never on. Or the unlucky seven million non‐Jews who died in the same camps but have been forgotten except for isolated reminders like William Styron's “Sophie's Choice.” Today we have the Cambodians. But how can they hope to compete with a Shah, with one man and his billions? Must they attempt an astronomical new death toll to be given their due? Endless questions. Perhaps solveable only in old Westerns. How would The Duke handle it? Certainly we each know in our hearts — however different our answers must inevitably be. Movie Star News"
Tallahassee Feminists and Doctors at Odds,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/18/archives/tallahassee-feminists-and-doctors-at-odds-doctor-quit-after.html,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla., Nov. 17 — Anyone who remembers the 1960's might feel a sense of déjà vu in the chaos of pamphlets, posters and communiqués in the sprawling, Mediterranean house near the center of the state capital, so isolated in the Florida Panhandle that people say you can't fly to heaven from here without going through Atlanta. Special to The New York Times The house, which has an old “for sale” sign out front, is headquarters for the Feminist Women's Health Center, an activist organization that has so alienated the local medical community that Tallahassee doctors have refused to provide any services here for the last four years. The center, which had to turn to out‐oftown doctors for the 8,000 abortions it has performed in this period, gets 400 telephone calls a week from women anyway, inquiring about anything from birth control to home remedies for gynecological infections. The clinic treats about 100 patients a week, The Tallahassee controversy, which has given rise both to an antitrust suit against six prominent doctors and jail sentences for four feminists, emerged from a fundamental difference of opinion about the degree to which the feminists should be able to challenge traditional medical care for women and to offer an alternative. Doctor Quit After Interview “Ninety percent of what happens in a gynecologist's office women could do for themselves,” said Susan Griffin, one of the workers at the center, which actively seeks to promote the philosophy that women can and should be more independent of doctors. The Tallahassee center opened quietly in March 1974 with educational programs for women and two months later began offering gynecological services, birthcontrol advice and low‐cost first‐trimester abortions using the once‐a‐week services of a respected local doctor who had staff privileges at the city's only hospital, then called Tallahassee Memorial Hospital. He was later joined by another doctor, and in the first year they performed 816 abortions. Then, in a June 1975 interview with The Tallahassee Democrat, Linda Curtis, a founder of the center, made clear it was not just another doctor's office. Women should be more involved in their own health care, she said, and while this did not mean doing without a doctor, it did mean doing without a doctor when possible. Women need better, cheaper, more accessible health care, she said, and the center would keep files on local doctors and make its own recommendations on which doctors women should see. The article enraged local gynecologists and obstetricians, who saw it as blatant self‐promotion by a group that, without apologies, stood as both critic and competitor. The day after it appeared, the clinic”s main doctor quit, saying that the clinic had violated its agreement with him not to advertise. Within two months, the second doctor also quit. State Investigation Sought The feminists said they then got in touch with more than 60 local physicians, half of those in the area, to seek help, but without success. Instead of closing the clinic, they began using resident doctors from Jacksonville, 169 miles away. Tallahassee doctors, who have insisted all along that their only concern was the welfare of women in need of medical care, asked the State Board of Medical Examiners to investigate the center. Outof‐town doctors, they observed, were at a disadvantage in providing follow‐up or emergency care for abortion patients. The state concluded that the clinic was operating within the law. Within a short time, the residents quit. The feminists countered by filing an antitrust suit charging six Tallahassee doctors with attempting to restrain trade and monopolize health care in Tallahassee. The suit was dismissed in Federal District Court but was reinstated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The United States Supreme Court recently refused to intervene and sent the case back here for trial. Whatever the outcome of the trial, the feminists’ cause suffered a setback inMarch 1977, when about 30 women's health activists attending a national meeting here made an unannounced evening “inspection” of the labor and delivery rooms and pewborn nurseries at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital. Activists Entered a Nursery Nurses and other hospital employees said later that the women were quiet, stayed only a few minutes, left when asked and did not enter any of the labor or delivery rooms. However, a few of the activists did enter a nursery, an act that enraged a judge, who later sentenced four of the women to jail for trespassing. In Leon County Court, Judge Charles D. McClure did not allow into evidence testimony that entering the nursery posed no risk to a newborn. “I think the potential damage to these infants in there is insurmountable,” he said, and a flurry of letters to the editor showed that many in Tallahassee agreed. Two of the women who went into the nursery, Virginia Cassidy‐Brinn and Carol Downer, both of Los Angeles, face 80‐day jail terms. The others, Miss Curtis, who now lives in New York, and Janice Cohen, also of New York, face sentences of 30 days. “I think it's very harsh,” said Joan Lovering, a director of the New Hampshire Feminist Health Center in Concord, N.H. “They should have considered what these women were doing and why.” Miss Lovering said the New Hampshire center was faring better with the local medical community than the Tallahassee center — doctors will cooperate and will refer patients — but other centers report similar problems. In Chico, Calif., for example, physicians have refused to work with the Chico Feminist Women's Health Center, the only clinic north of Sacramento which offers abortions. In Tallahassee, the center has managed to stay open but workers say that, without the cooperation of local doctors, it is an administrative nightmare. “We approach every doctor who comes to town,” said Anne Haskell, a member of the center's staff. “Sometimes they sound interested, but then they attend a medical meeting and realize they can't work with us.”"
Right to Life Party Gains Leverage,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/18/archives/long-island-weekly-right-to-life-party-gains-leverage.html,"THE Right to Life Party has emerged from the recent Long Island elections with nearly as much bargaining power as the Conservative Party for next year's crucial Congressional and legislative elections. The election returns on the Island, where the party was officially founded last year and is strongest, demonstrated that last year's gubernatorial vote for the new party was not a oneelection phenomenon. In Nassau, for example, the party can probably count on a hard‐core vote of at least 20,000, its vote in the gubernatorial election last year and countywide contests this year. That turnout was significcnt this year because it was an off‐year politically and the overall turnout for all parties was down considerably. The Right to Life tally represented some 4 percent of the total Nassau vote last year but 7 percent this year. In Suffolk, the vote for the new party in the County Executive election was 9,000 votes, or about 4 percent of the total. Last year, the party polled 12,000 votes on the gubernatorial line in Suffolk. But County Executive‐elect Peter F. Cohalan's landslide on the Republican line undoubtedly kept the new party's vote down. Mr. Cohalan forcefully disassociated himself from the Right to Life movement in several debates. Probably a more accurate gauge of the Right to Life hard‐core strength in Suffolk was the party's 15,000 votes in the contests for County Treasurer and Sheriff. That was only 6,000 votes off the Conservative Party tally in these two lowvisibility elections, in which party lines rather than personalities would be the determining factors in voters’ choices. It would also represent a 3,000‐vote increase in an off‐year election over last year's gubernatorial tally on the Right to Life line. The gap between the Conservatives and Right to Life Parties was even narrower in Nassau, with only 2,000 votes separating them at the county level and from 1,300 to 2,300 in contests for Supervisors of Hempstead, North Hempstead and Oyster Bay. Only in the election of the Hempstead Town Presiding Supervisor was there considerable spread, some 5,000 votes, between the two parties. The Right to Life Party supported the Democratic candidate, Andrew Wallace, while the Conservatives backed the Republican incumbent, Alfonse M. D'Amato, who won in a landslide. Clearly, with these results, the new party will have some leverage in close elections as it tries to pressure candidates for the Legislature and Congress to adopt its anti‐abortion position next year. Mary Jane Tobin of Merrick, the party's state chairman and its gubernatorial candidate last year, said that the party hoped to be fully organized with state committee and a formal party structure by next April. At the moment, even the number of the party's enrollees is not known because new enrollees or changes in enrollments at the recent election will not be counted for several weeks. Mrs. Tobin said that she did not expect the party to play a role in the Presidential selections of the other parties but that it would endorse a candidate or run its own candidate in the Presidential election next November. Eugene J. McMahon of Massapequa, a Right to Life Party lawyer and candidate for Oyster Bay Town Supervisor two weeks ago, predicted that the party would poll 300,000 votes statewide next year. That would put it in the same ball park as the Conservatives and probably ahead of the Liberal Party statewide. The new party is already far ahead of the Liberals on the Island. In the Suffolk County Executive contest, for example, the Liberal candidate polled only some 2,000 votes, compared with 14,000 for the Conservative and 9,000 on the Right to Life line. In Nassau, the Liberal candidate for County Clerk polled 5,000 votes, compared with 20,000 on the Right to Life and 22,000 on the Conservative lines. Thus the Liberals, the fifth‐ranking and once third‐ranking party, have virtually ceased to be a significant political factor on the Island. Despite the obvious competition between the Conservatives and Right to Life Party, they often supported the same candidates, particularly in Suffolk. In contests for the Suffolk County Legislature, for example, the antiabortion group joined Republican‐Conservative coalitions in eight elections; endorsed Republicans alone in four contests, Conservatives in two elections, Democrats in two elections and ran alone in one contest. The party did not have a candidate in one county legislative election. The pattern was similar in Town Supervisor races, with the Right to Life group joining Republican‐Conservative coalitions in four towns, endorsing a Republican in one town and a Democrat in another. It ran its own candidates in two Town Supervisor contests; there were no Right to Life candidates in two others. In Nassau County, where the new party produced its best turnout in the state and where its leadership resides, it was more inclined to go it alone. In countywide and town races, the new party ran its own candidates in 14 contests, joined a Republican‐Conservative coalition in six and endorsed a Democrat in one contest. The Conservative‐Right to Life coalition was not crucial this year in deciding many elections because of the Republican sweep led by Mr. Cohalan. However, the coalition was a factor in Smithtown, where Democrats ran strongly. County Legislator William Richards, a Republican who is deputy presiding officer of the Legislature, was saved by his votes on the Conservative and Right to Life lines. The two minor parties will also be the deciding factor if Councilwoman Joan Franke wins re‐election in a contest that is so close it will probably go to the courts for resolution. Control of the Town Board, which the G.O.P. has dominated for many years, will hinge on the outcome of that race. Whether the pattern on the Island this year becomes long‐term remains to be tested, particularly in Congressional and legislative races next year. Then the abortion question will be a proper issue, because these are the officials who enact state laws on abortion or would act on Medicaid funds for abortion or on a proposed Federal constitutional amendment barring abortions."
CAPITAL REPORT,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/18/archives/new-jersey-weekly-capital-report.html,"DURING a phone‐in program on New Jersey Public Television last week, Governor Byrne hinted, without commiting himself, that he would not sign into law the abortion bill now wending its way through the State Legislature. As Essex County Prosecutor for seven years, Mr. Byrne said, he had on several occasions brought charges against illegal “back alley” abortionists. “I have great concern for anything which will take us back to those days,” he declared. Both sides can take comfort from the bill as it now reads. As passed in June by the Assembly, the measure contained a preamble saying that the state's official position was that an unborn child was a “living human being” from the moment of conception. This provision, which raised the hackles of many women, is now gone from the bill. The Senate voted last week, 22 to 9, to delete the preamble and also a section that would make the state the legal guardian of any baby that survived an abortion. State Senator William J. Hamilton Jr., Democrat of New Brunswick, proposed these amendments, saying that he thought the state should not be in the business of regulating abortions. The abortion legislation has created almost as much controversy as did a measure to restore the death penalty. It now goes back to the Assembly for a vote on the Senate amendments. Governor Byrne vetoed the death‐penalty measure, but he probably will not have to do that to kill the abortion bill. The current Legislature expires in early January, and the Governor, if he wants to, can kill the measure by just filing it with the State Librarian. As the bill now reads, it would require: Physicians to give at least 24 hours’ notice to the parents before performing an abortion on a pregnant minor. Physicians to inform women of possible dangers in an abortion and to tell them of possible alternatives to abortion, such as state assistance. Require women to sign an “informed consent” statement 24 hours before an abortion. 9The State Health Department to collect statistics on abortions. Senators voting for the bill last Tuesday were the following Democrats: Eugene J. Bedell of Keansburg, Bernard J. Dwyer of Metuchen, Angelo J. Errichetti of Camden, David J. Friedland of Jersey City, Frank X. Graves Jr. of Paterson, John T. Gregorio of Linden, Mr. Hamilton, Joseph Hirkala of Passaic, Joseph A. Maressa of Blackwood, Joseph P. Merlino of Trenton, Carmen A. Orechio of Nutley, Francis E. Rodgers of Harrison, John F. Russo of Toms River, Anthony Scardino Jr. of Lyndhurst, John M. Skevin of Oradell and Raymond J. Zane of Woodbury. Republican Senators favoring the measure were James S. Cafiero of Wildwood, John H. Dorsey of Denville, Wayne Dumont Jr. of Phillipsburg, Walter E. Foran of Flemington, S. Thomas Gagliano of Long Branch, Garrett W. Hagedorn of Midland Park, Brian T. Kennedy of Sea Girt, Barry T. Parker of Mount Holly, Anthony E. Russo of Union, James P. Vreeland Jr. of Parsippany and Laurence S. Weiss of Perth Amboy. Voting against the bill were Frank J. Dodd of West Orange, Matthew Feldman of Teaneck, Francis X. Herbert of Waldwick, Wynona Lipman of Newark, Steven P. Perskie of Atlantic City and Charles B. Yates of Edgewater Park, all Democrats, and John H. Ewing of Bernardsville, Lee B. Laskin of Haddonfield and James H. Wallwork of Short Hills, Republicans. Not voting were John Caufield of Newark, William V. Musto of Union City and Walter N. Sheil of Jersey City, Democrats, and Donald DiFrancesco, Republican of Scotch Plains. Republicans in the State Assembly may be in for what one of them called a “bloodletting.” Assemblyman Dean A. Gallo of Parsippany is trying to replace James R. Hurley of Millville as minority party leader. Beginning in January, the Republicans will hold 36 of the 80 Assembly seats, and the minority party leader will be in a position to make deals with the Democrats. One G.O.P. Assemblyman who favors the retention of Mr. Hurley predicted that Mr. Gallo would win, saying that Mr. Gallo was actively campaigning for the post while Mr. Hurley was contenting himself with urging those who thought he had done a good job to support him again. “Dean's promising some of these people that he will get their bills passed,” said Mr. Hurley's friend. “But he's forgetting that if they do get by the Assembly, the ‘Ayatollah of Trenton’ will ‘deep six’ them.” Many Republican legislators refer to United Press International Picketing for abortion rights in Trenton Senator Merlino, the Senate President and a partisan Democrat, as the “Ayatollah of Trenton.” Mr. Merlino also may have some difficulty in fulfilling his claim that he has the Senate presidency locked up for another two years. Some legislative observors believe that Senator Dwyer may ease him out. Governor Byrne has named four commuters to the seven‐member board of the New Jersey Transit Corporation, the new state agency set up to buy and operate bus lines and oversee rail commuter transportation. The four will serve with the following three state officials: Louis J. Gambaccini, the Commissioner of Transportation, who will be chairman of the corporation; State Treasurer Clifford J. Goldman, and Betty Wilson, Deputy Commissioner of the Department of Enviornmental Protection. The commuters are Martin Brody of Short Hills, John McGoldrick of Prince ton, Verdell Roundtree of Plainfield and William Rodgers of North Brunswick. Approval of the nominations by the State Senate is expected tomorrow, and plans are for the new corporation to organize in early December, or just in time for final negotiations with Public Service for the purchase of Transport of New Jersey, the state's largest bus line.

Hospital Costs Defeat Last Week Was a Case in Point,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/18/archives/grassroots-lobby-bills-have-united-odd-pairings.html,"WASHINGTON — “Ordinary citizens” stream onto Capitol Hill by the thousands, arriving in convoys of buses. They overflow Congressional offices and corridors, some wearing small blue pins depicting grains of wheat that symbolize support for feeding starving Cambodians. Others sporting red‐apple lapel pins that signify that they love New York. Still others, opponents of legislation that would make abortions easier to get, hand out red roses. In the winter, tractors clog the city's streets as farmers arrive from the Middle West, demanding higher price supports. In the summer, when school is out, college students hold antidraft rallies on the Capitol steps. Many of these demonstrations appear to be spontaneous but they aren't always; often they're orchestrated and sometimes financed by large national lobbying organizations, many based in Washington. The organizations are frequently behind newspaper and magazine advertisements that urge readers to contact their Congressman. All of these activities are a part of grassroots lobbying, or indirect lobbying, aimed at mobilizing vox populi rather than directly persuading Congressmen through large umbrella organizations. Most groups don't like to talk about their grassroots lobbying but those that will comment acknowledge that grassroots efforts comprise a significant part of their work. Common Cause estimates that 70 percent of its budget is allotted to grassroots campaigns. Not all the work goes on in Washington. Last week, intensive lobbying in scores of cities and towns by hospital officials and physicians apparently paid off when the House of Representatives voted down proposed Federal controls on hospital costs. In the weeks ahead, Congress will be considering whether the groups that give political directions “ordinary citizens” should be forced to identify themselves and disclose their spending. The issue controversial. Last year, the House approved grassroots lobbying bill, but the Senate failed to act. Earlier this month, the House Judiciary Committee completed work on legislation that would overhaul the existing regulations that apply to lobbyists but decided to exclude grassroots campaigns, citing constitutional barriers. In the Senate, a Government Affairs subcommittee has concluded hearings on its version of lobbying reform legislation. Senator Lawton Chiles, Democrat of Florida and the subcommittee chairman, favors inclusion of some regulations dealing with grassroots lobbying. Not surprisingly, most lobbyists oppose any new laws aimed at the grassroots. Opposition to such proposals has united such traditional antagonists such as the National Right to Life Committee and the National Abortion Rights Action League, as well as the National Rifle Association and the National Coalition to Ban Handguns. “Grassroots lobbying turning into a perjorative term,” said David Landau, staff counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union. “It's an educational campaign. We inform people, and they trust our judgment and act accordingly.” “Grassroots lobbying creates uninhibited, wideopen public debate, and that's the best thing in the world,” he said, adding that Federal regulations could have a “chilling effect” on citizen participation in Government, a violation of First Amendment rights, Pmponents of the regulations argue, however, that grassroots lobbying has become so significant that lobbying bill without grassroots provisions would be meaningless. “Grassroots lobbying is the wave of the future,” said Michael Cole, director of legislative activities of Common Cause, one of the few lobbying groups that supports grassroots regulation. “It's how things are done.” “There is concern over whether this kind of action could constitutionally be regulated, since it so closely touches on the exercise of freedom of speech and rights of association,” the House Judiciary Committee said recently in a report on its bill. Federal court decisions that make similar points are often cited by opponents of grassroots lobbying regulations. In 1954, the Supreme Court said a legally acceptable lobbying disclosure statute “should be construed to refer only to ‘lobbying in its commonly accepted sense’ — to direct communication with members Congress on pending or proposed Federal legislation.” And in a 1976 case, a Federal Court of Appeals struck down as “overbroad” an amendment to the Federal Elections Act requiring disclosure by organizations that took any public action “designed to influence individuals to cast their votes for or against candidate or to withhold their votes from a candidate.” Representative Don Edwards, Democrat of California and chairman of the House Constitutional Rights Subcommittee, said that “efforts to require disclosure of indirect lobbying efforts would have an intolerable effect on the free exercise of constitutional rights.” But a fellow civil libertarian, Representative Robert W. Kastenmeier, Democrat of Wisconsin, takes the opposite view. He believes that, given an overriding public concern, Congress is empowered to protect the public interest by demanding disclosure of the identity of those who mobilize large lobbying efforts. That same public interest justified Congress’ right to require disclosure of the names of financial contributors to election campaigns, he said. “I think that people who support ideals, candidates and parties ought to have long since accepted the fact that their views could be made public,” Mr. Kastenmeier said. With five other Judiciary Committee members, Mr. Kastenmeier wrote a dissent to the committee position. “In our judgment, any lobbying disclosure legislation is incomplete if it fails to require registered lobbying organizations to disclose such largescale grassroots activities,” they said. Their proposal, which will reach the House floor in the form an amendment to the committee bill, would apply only to organizations that spent a substantial amount - $10,000 or $25,000 — during a calendar quarter on lobbying solicitations. Expenditures of less than $500 would be exempted. Their amendment would also require identification of the issues on which the grassroots lobbying campaign had been carried out, the identity of anyone retained to raise money for such activity, and the total amount of money spent on the effort. Only the organization making the solicitation would have to report. United Press International Antiabortionists rally on U.S. Capitol grounds earlier this year."
The World,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/18/archives/the-world-in-summary-a-nablus-mayors-deportation-strains-begin.html,"Israel further consolidated peace with Egypt last week by giving back more of the Sinai, but new trouble in the still‐occupied territories worsened its relations with the Palestinians. The Government ordered the deportation of the Arab Mayor of Nablus, Bassam al‐Shaka, who had been reported as sympathizing with terrorist violence. Partial transcripts of the Mayor's replies to questions by the West Bank Military Governor later established that he had not endorsed terrorism, saying only that it could be expected to continue in reaction to repressive occupation measures. Insisting that the expulsion order was justified, Israeli officials then said the Mayor was the Palestine Liberation Organization's top official on the West Bank. With Mr. Shaka in jail pending a supreme court review of his expulsion, all 25 Arab mayors in the West Bank and Gaza resigned in protest. Liberal Israelis such as former Foreign Minister Abba Eban also criticized the expulsion order. The political heat threatened to mire more deeply the negotiations for Palestinian autonomy. “I bet they can't find a single person now ready to talk. They've killed it,” said a Palestinian in East Jerusalem. Concerned by that possibility, the United States again urged Israel to reconsider its actions. There were two related moves in the contretemps. Defense Minister Ezer Weizman reportedly planned to abolish the job of the Military Governor, taking more direct control of the politically sensitive West Bank himself. And a Cabinet committee decided Israel will build 10,000 to 15,000 Jewish housing units there. However, new settlements will be confined to stateowned land, to comply with court rulings. The net effect was further strains on the Government of Prime Minister Menachem Begin. Already pressuring the Government to move more vigorously on settlements, one religious party's participation in the Begin coalition was jeopardized after Parliament narrowly rejected a measure to stiffen abortion law requirements. However, a threat of withdrawal by the Agudat Israel Party was put off until a new vote can be held. On the bright side, at an airstrip near Mount Sinai, revered by Christians, Jews and Moslems as the site where Moses received the Ten Commandments, Israel returned a 580square‐mile region to Egypt. The transfer, originally scheduled for Jan. 25, was advanced so President Anwar el‐Sadat could lay the cornerstone there for a new interfaith chapel tomorrow, the second anniversary of his historic visit to Israel. A Slap in the Face For Hanoi Invasion Joan Baez is not the only former Vietnam sympathizer to have changed hdr opinion of Hanoi. By a 91‐to‐21 vote, the other developing nations that now dominate the United Nations General Assembly voted last week to demand the withdrawal of “all foreign forces” from Cambodia. The only foreign troops there are Vietnam's. The resolution, like most General Assembly motions, was unlikely to have much practical effect. But officials noted that it was the first time the United Nations had censured Vietnam, although Hanoi and Moscow were rebuffed this fall in attempts to transfer Cambodia's seat from the ousted Pol Pot regime to that of Heng Samrin, installed by Vietnam. Allowing More Help In a meeting last week with American and Australian legislators in the Cambodian capital, Foreign Minister Hun Sen said more international relief flights would be allowed into Phnom Penh (previously there have been only one a day) and flights into regional airports might also be permitted. He again rejected, however, aid by way of Thailand which might benefit guerrillas loyal to Pol Pot. His comments, reported by Representative Elizabeth Holtzman, the Brooklyn Democrat who led the American delegation, were an implicit rebuttal of Defense Minister Pen Sovan who was in Moscow a month ago and told Pravda that “no one is dying of hunger in our country.” Reports to the contrary were a figment of Western and Chinese propaganda, he said. The eight‐hour glimpse that the Americans and Australians had of Phnom Penh was sufficient to confirm both the people's deprivation and their tentative efforts at reconstruction. “Human depletion is the most striking fact that stares at a visitor,” wrote Henry Kamm, a correspondent for The New York Times who accompanied the legislators. He said that 70,000 people had returned to the capital, which was forceably depopulated by the Pol Pot regime. Public services such as water and electricity are resuming intermittently, but there is no currency and those lucky enough to have jobs are paid in food. Haiti Events Could Aid ‘Boat People’ In Port au Prince, there was bad news when Haitian police broke up a human rights meeting, beat up the speaker, injured a Haitian radio reporter and roughed up foreign observem. Last week, the Government expressed “regret” that American and other foreign diplomats were mistreated. But then it issued more bad news: the 28‐year‐old President for Life, Jean‐Claude Duvalier, announced that followers of his late, tyrant father, “Papa Doc,” were being brought back into the Government. The events in Haiti could have benign repercussions in Florida, however, where 8,000 to 12,000 Haitian “boat people” are fighting to stay in the United States. Immigration officials have up to now rejected their claims to political asylum, contending they fled Haiti's poverty, not political persecution. Their friends said they were prosecuted because they are black, while other refugees are being admitted. Their lawyers charged discrimination, and a lower court agreed. Now they can request the State Department's report on the latest violence, in rebutting a Justice Department appeal. Taste of Freedom For South Korea Relatively speaking, there were never many political prisoners under President Park Chung Hee. No need for it. Emergency Decree 9, invoked by Mr. Park in 1975 and outlawing all criticism of his government, was enough to frighten most South Koreans into submission. Last week, it appeared that the decree had died with Mr. Park. Acting President Choi Kyu Hah ordered preparations for the release of 200 of the country's reported 249 political prisoners (the tally comes from Christian sources) held under the law. Among them is Kim Dae Jung, whose near‐victory in presidential elections in 1971 prompted Mr. Park to suppress democracy in South Korea. Mr. Kim, who has been under house arrest since his release from a prison hospital last December, is still the leading opposition figure in South Korea. If his political rights are restored with his freedom of movement, he is likely to try again for the presidency under a new constitution that has been promised by Acting President Choi. His likely opponent, ironically, will be Kim Jong Pil, the planner of Mr. Park's 1961 coup and the architect of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency which kidnapped Kim Dae Jung from Japan in 1973.

World News Briefs,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/20/archives/world-news-briefs-china-charges-incursion-by-vietnam-killing-many.html,"PEKING, Tuesday, Nov. 20 (UPI) —China charged today that Vietnamese troops intruded “deep into Chinese territory” and said the incursion resulted in heavy loss of life. The Chinese Foreign Ministry sent the protest note this morning to the Vietnamese Embassy in Peking, The New China News Agency said. The protest, released by the agency, said Vietnamese forces shelled and machine‐gunned a commune in Maguan county in China's Yunnan province. The intial bombardment on Nov. 4 destroyed houses and killed and wounded “a number of Chinese inhabitants,” the agency said. Then about 100 Vietnamese troops “penetrated deep into the Chinese territory, attacked Chinese frontier outposts, opened fire wantonly on Chinese inhabitants in the border area, and seized large quantities of their property,” the note said. Cardinal in Manila Protests Provisions of Martial Law Special to The New York TImes MANILA, Nov. 19 — Jaime Cardinal Sin of Manila told a group of businessmen today that the Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines would encourage its members to assert their rights against the excesses of martial law. “We have no free speech, press and assembly,” the Cardinal said. “Habeas corpus remains suspended and we are subject to arbitrary arrests. But we cannot go on saying yes to this situation.” “Our lives and our prosperity are dependent on one signature,” the Cardinal said, alluding to the power of President Ferdinand E. Marcos. 400,000 at Rally in Madrid Pay Homage to Franco MADRID, Nov. 19 (UPI) — Some 400,000 followers of the late Francisco Franco attended a rally in Madrid to pay homage to the dictator and denounce “the dismemberment of our nation.” The demonstration yesterday was the largest right‐wing gathering since Franco died four years ago. Speakers denounced abortion, divorce and pornography, but primarily they directed their remarks at the home‐rule statutes negotiated by the Government of Prime Minister Adolfo Suarez for the northern Basque country and Catalonia. The statutes grant the provinces many of the governmental powers that Franco took away from them in his effort to centralize rule in Spain. Gromyko Arrives in Spain For 3‐Day Official Visit Special to The New York Times MADRID, Nov. 19 — Andrei A. Gromyko arrived here today for a three day official visit, the first to Spain by a Soviet Foreign Minister. Mr. Gromyko, who will meet with King Juan Carlos, Prime Minister Adolfo Suarez and the leaders of the Socialist and Communist opposition, is expected to press the Soviet Union's opposition to Spain's joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In a brief statement at Barajas Airport, the Soviet diplomat noted that “the flight from Moscow took us only five hours, but the normalization of SovietSpanish diplomatic relations has not been short.” Madrid re‐established diplomatic ties with Moscow in February 1977."
Science Watch,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/20/archives/science-watch-prenatal-diagnosis.html,"Prenatal Diagnosis If all pregnant women between the ages of 35 and 45 took advantage of available techniques to detect chromosome and nervous system abnormalities in their unborn children, their risk of bearing a child with a serious birth defect could be reduced to that faced by younger women, according to calculations by researchers and the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta. The calculations presume mat an me older women found to be carrying abnormal fetuses would undergo abortions. In an article in the Nov. 23 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, the researchers said that full use of the prenatal detection technique, known as amniocentesis, would also significantly reduce the number of abnormal births to women who conceive past the age of 45. But even with amniocentesis and abortion of abnormal fetuses, such women would still be twice as likely as younger mothers to bear a defective child, their calculations showed. Chasing Comets Scientists were asked last week to propose experiments for a planned 1985 international mission to explore two comets —Halley and Tempel 2. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, in cooperation with the European Space Agency, proposes to fly a spacecraft past Halley's comet in 1985, when it makes its next appearance, and release an instrumented probe to investigate the comet's interior. Then the spacecraft would proceed to a rendezvous with Tempel 2 in 1988 and fly side by side with it for a year or more. The mission, which has not yet been approved by Congress, has three major science objectives: to determine the chemical and physical nature of a comet's nucleus, to characterize the chemical and physical nature of the gases and dust surrounding the nucleus and to determine the nature of a comet's tail. Jurassic‐Period Bones The first cluster of Jurassic‐period dinosaur bones ever found in South America has been reported, promising to shed new light on a period of evolution about which relatively little is known. Describing the discovery in the journal Science, the Argentine paleontologist J.F. Bonaparte of the Museo Argentin° de Ciencias Naturales, said at least three hitherto unknown species of dinosaurs have been identified in the find. The dinosaur assemblage, Dr. Bonaparte said, supports the idea that terrestrial animals migrated between North and South America during the Jurassic, a period extending from 165 million to 135 million years ago. The dinosaurs were found in Patagonia, a vast region in southern Argentina that extends south nearly to the Antarctic Circle. While many of the fossils found by Dr. Bonaparte's team bear resemblances to well‐known dinosaur species of the Northern Hemisphere, some are markedly more primitive and afford comparisons that will facilitate tracing dinosaur evolution and geographic distribution, he said. Among the new species is a large, two‐legged flesh‐eater named Piatnitzkysaurus floresi, a primitive version of the North American allosaurus. Both dinosaurs stood some 12 feet high and were armed with powerful jaws and dagger‐like teeth. Two new plant‐eating sauropod dinosaurs were also found and named — Patagosaurus fariasi and Volkheimeria chubetensis. In another development, paleontologists and ordinary dinosaur fans will apparently have to adjust themselves to a new look in the brontosaurus — the 90‐foot‐long plant‐eater whose outline is a corporate trademark of the Sinclair oil company. The head of the huge beast is traditionally represented as having a blunt face and jaws containing flat, spoonlike teeth. But John S. McIntosh of Wesleyan University, Middletown, Conn., and David S. Pittsburgh, have assembled overwhelming evidence that the brontosaurus's head was actually long and pointed, with pencil‐like teeth. Many paleontologists since 1883 had known there was something wrong with the traditional representation of the head, but the new evidence is so convincing that museums everywhere plan to make the change. Even the 100year‐old brontosaur fossil in New York's American Museum of Natural History will get a new head, the museum's curator said. George Winnick Fluid withdrawn from the uterus by amniocentesis can be tested for evidence of hereditary disorders."

Books of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/22/archives/books-of-the-times-taking-the-risks-of-change.html,"CLOSE TO HOME. By Ellen Goodman. 251 pages. Simon & Shuster. $9.95. ELLEN GOODMAN, whose column in The Boston Globe is syndicated to more than 200 newspapers across the country, must be pushing 40 by now. This means that — always Too Tall for Her Age, and probably too tart — she was incubated in the 50's, hacked her way through the incoherence of the 60's and, as the 70's staggered toward closing time, she is more than prepared twice a week to fry the cultural Spam. Hers is a special kitchen, full of politics, children, magazines of popular psychology, artificial asparagus and the sort of people she describes as “walking dialecticians” — people trying to synthesize something out of the conflicting demands of their personal and professional lives, the Virgin of self and the Dynamo of society. “Close to Home” consists of 109 of her columns, on everything from Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn to being on time. Among the 109, there is not a single temper tantrum. Although she is often angry — at doctors, at photographers, at apathetic or careerist college students, at judges and presidents, at Walter Cronkite and I. F. Stone and television — she is too good‐humored, and perhaps impatient, to be a scourge. Only connect, she asks. Be fair and be brave. Taking the Risks of Change Synthesis means change, at home and in the culture. Change “is not a seesaw but a spiral.” It is hard, especially that “most difficult kind of change: Change without loss.” It requires risks: “Some of the most self‐aware people had taken their chances first and their temperature second. They didn't put introspection as a barrier before experience. They knew themselves in retrospect, through their histories. As an old and understanding man had said once in Detroit, ‘My love has been on-the-job training.’ “ Still, that which was personal and exacerbated in the 60's must be secured and socialized for the 80's. As parents and as citizens, we have a lot of growing up do. On the 70's, she is not as hard as she might be. It has been, she suggests, less of a “Me First” decade than “Who Else?” decade, a decade of “Island People” who are not so much egocentric as they are sad and scared and lonely, people afraid that marriage is nothing more than “a divorce opportunity,” people to whom children are threatening. She proposes “a statute of limitations on blame.” What change is not is sad: “Alternative lifestyles, the emotional fly‐drive packages of our times, come equipped with a set of clothes, a choice of authors, a limited menu of sports and a discount coupon book of cliches.” Nor is change jargon. She disdains the arid “relationship” because, among other handicaps, it resists poetry and song. She asks us to imagine, “How do I relate to thee, let me count the ways,” “Come live with me and be my relationship,” “Relationship is a manysplendored thing” and “I relate to you a bushel and a peck.” Love, then, is permitted, and children, and fathers, even if the fathers are rather late in finding out what is ex- pected of them. From the personal —her mother, her daughter, her vegetable garden — she leaps to the public, the political, a Gerald R. Ford, a Bella S. Abzug, a Hubert H. Humphrey, a Martha Mitchell, without ever losing her balance. Divorce, after all, is a calamitous social fact; nothing could be more personal and more political at the same time than abortion; the way we raise our children is more important than how we vote. Ellen Goodman likes to vote. She also likes to be on time, and for other people to be on time, too: “If I were a train I'd be gone.” She is ambivalent on male cologne and designer jockey shorts. She dislikes smoke detectors that sleep through a closed‐flue fire that blackens her house, although they can be counted on to sound the loud alarm every time she broils a lamb chop. She is firm in denouncing the author of the book “Success!” as “someone with the moral perspective of a mushroom.” I find her such agreeable company, of course, because I share so many of her prejudices. 2‐Sentence Styling Problem The obligatory quibbles: I wish that most of her paragraphs weren't just two sentences long — a styling problem, maybe, at The Globe — because her thoughts are longer. Her compulsion to refer so often to Abr,ham Maslow and Philip Roth is mystifying. If she is going to quote Stanley Milgram, the psychologist, with such approval, she might at least describe his reprehensible experiments on human beings. Surely the Dorothy with whom Sinclair Lewis had such a stormy time was Thompson, not Parker. And, contrary to her assertion that men don't write about “their private lives, the interior landscape, the changes in their experience over the past 20 years,” I think immediately of the short stories of John Cheever and John Updike, John Irving in “The World According to Garp,” Robert Minor in “Mother's Day” and so on. Finally, though, one finishes “Close to Home” full of gratitude for having been introduced to a witty and civilized human being in a vulgar and self-pitying decade. Sigrid Estrada Ellen Goodman"
"Optimistic Bush ‘Fired Up,’",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/23/archives/optimistic-bush-fired-up-feels-drive-is-moving-good-outlook-in-iowa.html,"WICHITA FALLS, Tex., Nov. 20 “It's tough out there,” George Bush keeps telling people. But he says that it is getting easier as he tries to persuade listeners that he and his Presidential campaign are taking off, just as Jimmy Carter did four years ago. Being the choice of 3 percent of Republicans is not a commanding position, nor even much of a spot for an ambush. But it is clear that Mr. Bush and his campaign have hit their stride, and at the best possible time for an outsider. Last week Ronald Reagan declared, and the Republican Florida convention took a Presidential straw poll in which Mr. Bush ran a surprisingly strong third, with 21 percent of the vote. Now there are no remaining obvious opportunities for Republicans to win attention and change perceptions until the Iowa caucuses on Jan. 21. Mr. Bush is the hot property right now, with straw poll successes in three states to boast of, a revitalized speaking style and organization support in some key early states. Good Outlook in Iowa Seen Moreover, the news of those straw polls, and the organization, are meshing in Iowa. One senior Republican said today that he expected Mr. Bush to run Mr. Reagan a close second or possibly beat him in the Iowa caucuses. Across the state, Iowans are beginning to talk about him as a leading candidate, and he drew an audience of 400 people in Sioux City a few days ago, an impressive turnout. Still, the “tough out there” description remains apt. In fact, the candidate more often uses the phrase to emphasize his experience in foreign affairs, and perhaps to combat the impression some people have of him as too nice for the Presidency. But he uses it accurately to describe his own situation, too. The former Congressman, diplomat and Director of Central Intelligence raised cheers and money from old friends in Oklahoma and Texas this week as he told them how six straw poll victories in Iowa and Maine and his strong thirdplace finish in Florida had him and his staff “fired up, optimistic.” ‘A. Cumulative Realization’ With a bit of exaggeration, he said here that the press had interpreted those results into “a cumulative realization that our campaign is moving.” The Bush campaign may be taking off. Or it may not. It is well‐organized and in the black, but if the straw polls are a measure of standing, so are the public opinion surveys, which show him far behind not only Mr. Reagan but also John B. Connally and Senator Howard H. Baker Jr. Fund‐raising is also a test of popular support, and while Mr. Bush has raised $3.4 million and has $165,000 on hand, Mr. Connally has raised $6.9 million and has $1 million on hand. Mr. Bush accepts the comparison of his dogged campaign with Mr. Carter's in 1976. He has campaigned 347 days in 1978 and 1979, with 37 of them in New Hampshire, 34 in Florida and 24 in Iowa. He has plainly worked harder than his rivals have. But Mr. Carter was copying George McGovern, who used the same tactics in 1972, so he had some forewarning of potential success. There is no track record to suggest that the Republican Party is equally susceptible to guerrilla warfare, even if the Che Guevara of the movement is Yale, oil and banking and a former national party chairman. Most of all, the Republican Party has shown no recent inclination toward deviations from conservative orthodoxy. Mr. Bush has something of a reputation as a moderate, even though his positions on most issues are as conservative as Mr. Reagan's. The exceptions are some social issues like abortion and the proposed equal rights amendment to the Constitution. But he chooses moderate language to explain conservative positions, and that does not reassure the right. Here, for example, he endorsed a “windfall” profits tax on oil as long as it had a provision for a hefty plowback into the industry, but a supporter of Mr. Connally then accused him of insensitivity to capital. No Apocalyptic Terms Also, in speaking of foreign policy decisions he disapproves of, he does not portray them in apocalyptic, Communistsvs.-free-world terms. But he argues that breaking the defense treaty with Taiwan, giving up the Panama Canal and not backing Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi of Iran more firmly all come together to “diminish our worldwide credibility.” His eclectic campaign staff also carries no message of orthodoxy. His political director, David A. Keene, was with Mr. Reagan in 1976, and his chairman and his press secretary, James A. Baker 3d and Peter Teeley, worked for President Ford. Mr. Teeley's deputy, Susan Morrison, worked for Senator Frank Church's campaign, and a key Southern representative, Charles Snider, worked for George C. Wallace. In Iowa and New Hampshire, Mr. Bush's strongest support comes from Republicans who think of themselves as moderates. But even in that area he has to compete with Mr. Baker. who is mak- ing some belated gains in New Hampshire. One other potential liability may be his last and most important Government job, as head of the Central Intelligence Agency. Mr. Bush regularly wins applause by saying, “I am sick and tired of these attacks on the C.I.A.,” but his latest campaign brochure is vaguer. It manages to list most of the titles he has held, all the way back to captain of the Yale baseball team, but avoids the words “Central Intelligence” in speaking of his last role. Mr. Bush plainly has some potential for gaining strength nationally. The latest New York Times /CBS News Poll showed him most favorably regarded among those with higher incomes and more education, but also among those who said they were paying attention to the Presidential election. It may be that these people are the ones who respond to his constant emphasis on experience in foreign policy, rarely a voting issue. On inflation, he sounds much like the other Republicans, wanting any tax cut to encourage productivity by speeding up depreciation rates. He was jaunty as he sought to persuade audiences here and In Tulsa, Oklahoma City, Lubbock, Midland and Houston where fund‐raising crowds exceeded ex- pectations — that he could win. “Organization is going to do it for me,” he said. More successes, he contended, will enable him to win in May in Texas, where he is now thought to be a distant third. The Likeliest Bets To get anywhere, Mr. Keene acknowledges, Mr. Bush will have to beat Mr. Reagan somewhere. Iowa and Massachusetts now seem to be the likeliest bets. Mr. Bush jabs at Mr. Reagan without mentioning his name. On foreign policy, for example, he says, “I've been there, not lecturing on the Republican free enterprise circuit.” And another brochure, which he contends with a smile does not relate at all to the 68-year-old former Governor of California, says: “George Bush is the right age. He will be 56 at the time of the 1980 election. This is the age which business, professional and educational organizations recognize as the time of maximum executive ability. This is the age when the individual reaches the peak of mental capacity.” Mr. Bush frequently talks of his jogging three miles a day and, to underline the point, he put on his running clothes last weekend in Florida and trotted right up to Mr. Reagan.

LETTERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/25/archives/letters-the-feds-cure-chrysler-ruff-times-regulation-costs.html,"To the Business Editor: In his hands, the dismal science retains all those elements that frustrate the policy maker. This much Prof. James Tobin senses (“Why the Fed's Cure Won't Work,” Nov. 11). His careful and not unsympathetic view of the policy of Paul A. Volcker (and perhaps, in the background, Carter) leaves only one impression. That such Protean efforts cannot succeed in reducing inflation. Indeed, if one follows Tobin carefully, the price is too high and the process — however orchestrated — is too slow. Inflation is so ingrained a part of the U.S. economic system that there is no quick fix. Suppose that one, for the moment, agrees with Professor Tobin, what follows? Given that the Fed (and fiscal policy, too) cannot induce a reduction in price that is not massively overmatched by a reduction in economic activity (along with sharp and socially costly increases in unemployment), what is the Administration to do? One would have thought that the Tobin recommendation might have been to “damn the torpedoes” and go full speed ahead with these social policies that are his favorites. Instead, what he recommends is a stringent policy that is a fantastic mixture of decontrol, higher taxes, rationing and grant-in-aid to the poor. All this plus frozen wages and retail markups. What is missing is a convincing argument that these weapons will do what stringent monetary policy cannot do. Or more, that his proposals will reduce prices generally (while avoiding mas‐. sive unemployment). Decontrol of energy prices, however engineered, will surely cause the consumer price index to rise (by at least two percentage points over the year). Gasoline rationing, if possible under current legislation, itself arguable, will not reduce nor even prevent prices from rising, should real shortages prevail. That much we have learned from World War II experience. Cash help to the poor, however defended and no matter how good the motives, is, after all, a demand‐sustaining proposal that cannot help but increase price pressures in a market that one would have supposed needed less, not more, stimulation. The proposal to freeze wages, largely lacking in logical relationship to the rest of the package, can only be justified to the extent that the current “income policy” has failed, and the evidence is that it has not. If Mr. Tobin is right about his summary of policy effects on prices as against production, and I think that he is, then the obvious and dismal conclusion is that the fight against inflation is a waste of effort. It was Mr. Tobin who said in another context recently that “seldom has society made such large, immediate and tangible sacrifices to avert an ill‐defined, uncertain, eventual evil.” That these sacrifices are to be made by the very classes least in position to protect themselves suggest the enormity of the social harm of the purposed and actual anti‐inflation poli CHARLES J.

Ronald Reagan and John Connally oppose current proposals to deregulate the trucking industry, with its appalling inflationary effects, its monumental energy waste, and bureaucratic inertia. Barry Goldwater and his fellow conservatives in Arizona supported the huge Central Arizona Water Project, a $1-billion-plus Federal boondoggle designed to benefit his state's land speculators.

STANLEY D. CHESS New York, Nov. 11, 1979 Regulation Costs To the Business Editor: Mark Green and Norman Waitzman's “A Challenge to Murray Weidenbaum” (Oct. 28) is an important attempt to provide some counterbalance to the current complaints over government regulation, and we owe them a debt of gratitude for their efforts. In their recently published study, “Business War on the Law,” on which The Times piece was based, they are sharply critical of the methodology used by Weidenbaum and others in widely quoted and deceptively firm estimates of the costs of regulation. Their study also casts doubt on other supposed problems of regulation, such as its alleged contribution to inflation and unemployment. For example, they cite testimony by Barry Bosworth, then director of the Council on Wage and Price Stability, that all government regulation only contributed about three‐quarters of a percent to the inflation rate during 1978. On the benefits side, Green and Waitzman rightly emphasize that it is often difficult to measure the positive results of regulation. How do you measure a reduction in pain and suffering, or assess the benefits of a program that prevents cancer deaths some 30 years hence by reducing current occupational exposures to suspected carcinogens? What is clear is that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's attempts to control toxic substances such as cotton dust, lead, benzene, D.B.C.P., arsenic, acrylonitrile and coke oven emissions will save thousands of workers from crippling disease and death. Even though “Business War on the Law” will be dismissed by some as onesided, many of the studies it cites are serious estimates made by respected groups with no obvious ax to grind —and those estimates run counter to the popular rhetoric about the “enormous” costs of regulation.

HOW CARTER CAN WIN,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/25/archives/how-carter-can-win-carter.html,"Conventional Wisdom is one of those Usually Reliable Sources beloved of political pundits, a shadowy figure whose opinions reek of selfserving rumor and self‐fulfilling prophecy. These days C.W. has it that Jimmy Carter's campaign for re‐election is neck‐deep in trouble — and he's already standing on his toes. The President has been running only slightly better than None of the Above in public‐opinion polls. And with the entrance of Senator Edward M. Kennedy into the race fur the Democratic nomination, Carter finds himself opposing myth as well as a Mail. lice Conventional Wisdom has been wrong before, and it would be foolhardy to condemn the President to electoral oblivion inn of hand. As Kennedy becomes the focus of press attention and criticism, Carter's standing in some polls is already beginning to creep upward. Moreover, if one looks behind the polls, it is clear that tarter retains some important strengths. As a person, he is still perceived to be decent and honest. As President, In possesses enormous power to confer favors and dominate the news. As a campaigner, he has already proved that he has the grit and stamina to come from behind and win. But can he do it again? In pursint of an educated answer, 10 professional political consultants were asked to consider the question: “If you were given the assignment, how would you run Jimmy Carter's Campaign?” Several of them viewed the task as all but hopeless. “If the President was our client,” said one Democratic expert, “we'd tell him not to run.” Added a Republican: “He's a dead sure loser right now.” Hut there was also a sometimes grudging respect for Carter's polincal expertise. “Hamilton Jordan and Jody Powell can't run the country,” said one Of the President's top aides, “but they're backwoods politicians who can run a campaign that call cut you up pretty bad.” Two of the consultants were already working for the President — Robert Keefe, a former strategist for Henry M. Jackson, and Robert a specialist in films and commercials. Four tra ditionally aid Republican., and this time around Hill Russo is working for Senator Bob Dole, John P. Sears for Ronald Reagan and David Keene for George Bush. Robert Teeter, a polling expert, worked for Gerald Ford in 1976. Four others have longstanding ties to the liberal wing of the Democratic Party — Joseph Napolitan and Mathew A. Reese and the team of Joe Rothstein and Jill Buckley. All of the consultants have their own biases, of course, and their own axes to grind. The Republicans, for instance, were less hesitant about prescribing a Carter game plan that might, along the way, tear the Democratic Party apart. But the 10 had in common a somewhat sardonic view of their trade. Asked for some slogans, Squires came up with “Kennedy for King, Carter for President,” and Rothstein offered “No matter what you think, he's beer a good President.” And they also shared some assumptions about the upcoming election. To a remarkable degree, they agreed on a blueprint for the President to follow in the In the words of Squires, the Carter man, the President must “go back to basics.” Control the ball, grind out yardage, don't make stupid mistakes, stay close until the last quarter and hope for a break. Kennedy may put his foot in his mouth while trying to kick the game‐winning field goal. And all the while, remember that 19110 is a different ball game from the last time around. In 1976, for example, as an obscure former Governor of Georgia, Carter was perfectly placed to run against Washington and the Establishment. Today he is the symbol of Washington and the leader of the Establishment. You can't holler, “Throw the rascals out,” when you're the chief rascal. Or, as David Keene, the George Bush aide, put it, “When you're President, you've got to be President; you can't just be a candidate.” Moreover, in 1976, in the wake of Watergate, Carter was able to play to the nation's yearning for a leader who seemed decent and honorable. But today, as Carter man Keefe says, “the issue is the effectiveness of Government, means, the experts say, that Carter must use his office to counteract his biggest liability — the feeling that he is a weak and indecisive leader. Of course, earlier tries for a “new” Carter have failed. As pollster Teeter comments: The first thing he's got to do is to go a sustained period without shooting himself in the foot.” Another major difference between ‘76 and ‘80: the first time around, Carter was an outsider who never really established a firm base or constituency. Being all things to all voters worked back then, but now, the consultants suggest, he risks becoming nothing to anybody. He has to create a core of loyalists, a new foundation that says, “I'm for you, Jimmy Carter, and not just against everybody David Keene offers this analysis: “Politics is essentially an exercise, at sonic point, of drawing some sort of line. ‘Here's where I am. Some will be with me and some not.’ Carter from the beginning has been unwilling to draw that kind of line.” ISSUES One at the ironies at Jimmy Carter's tenure has been the perception that he is most effective on just those issues that win him the fewest votes, from the Panama Canal to the strategic‐arms limitation treaty. The experts feel, however, that SALT is worth a continuing, major effort. He should march up to Capitol Hill and personally lead the fight for the treaty, they say, while at the same time covering his right flank by “standing up to the Russians” when he gets a chance. (One of the Democratic consultants offered this aside: “Carter got his symbols all wrong on the SALT treaty. He should have kissed Kennedy and told Brezhnev he would whip his butt.”) The President must also be ready, the experts say, to take advantage of sudden new developments around the world. Bill Russo, who's working for Bob Dole, says Carter should be hoping (or “some international crisis that gives him the opportunity to appear thoroughly steadfast and able to perform under crisis.” But as the seizure of the American Embassy in Iran demonstrates, crisis politics can be a high‐risk game. As of this writing, the outcome in Teheran is in doubt, but clearty, if the hostages are recovered, Carter will Be a hero: if the situation falls apart, he may suffer great political loss. On the domestic side, concern over inflation and energy tops every poll by a wide margin, and the campaign consultants see these issues as a chance for him to play the leader and take charge of the arive to push his proposals through Congress. Few of those measures will have any immediate impact, but a Presidential candidate's task is often rhetorical. “Somehow or other.” says Keefe, who is talking about a current client, “he's got to get a handle on the energy issue.” What makes energy so critical is the double bind of shortage and price. Keefe would have the President “make sure that the element of inflation chargeable to energy is clearly defined. He has to convince people that the program he's started in the energy area will lead to long‐range price stability.” David Keene, for one, thinks the time is right for a dramatic move against inflation. “I'd put in wage and price conirols,” said the Bush strategist. “They don't work, but Democrats like them. And ve're not talking economics, about whether they deal with causes or symptoms. As far as the public is concerned, they could work politically for the President, and there's something Kennedy couldn't criticize SCAPEGOATS No mater what Carter does, he is not going to be able to claim victory over inflation. Bob Keefe, the onetime Jackson aide, offers a way to overcome that disadvantage: Blame somebody else. “One technique available is to pick a bogyman,” says Keefe, and beat him about the head and neck on a regular basis.” There are three prime candilates for the ogre role — Congress, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and the big oil companies. Keefe notes sardonically, “They're all rather good targets because none have any credibility as institutions.” But they all have drawbacks as well. Slicing up Congress, says Keefe, has to he done with a delicate touch,” because voters do not like to see discord within their Government. And if you push the lawmakers too hard, they could push right back, burying some of Carter's favorite proposals. OPEC is another tempting target, but he oil‐producing countries also have weapons at their disposal: they can simply shut off their pipelines. Perhaps the best casting for Chief Bogymen are the big oil companies. ‘People think they're villains,” noted Keefe. “They're concerned that the Government has as little control over the companies as they do over consumers.” DECENCY The image of purity long attached to Jimmy Carter has been somewhat sullied by the well‐publicized behavior of such close connections as Bert Lance, brother Billy and Hamilton .Jordan. Many of the consultants felt strongly that the President cannot afford any more blotches. “The first thing I'd do is get rid of Hamilton Jordan,” advised Joe Rothstein, whose clients tend to be Democratic liberals. “I happen to like him, he's very talented. But Carter's got to get back his moral standing, and I think Jordan's hurt him incredibly.” Jordan is like a son to Carter — the President is unlikely to banish him. But Bill Russo, who often labors in the Republican vineyards, has another suggestion for playing up the morality theme. He would find Carter's “Billy Graham,” a visible supporter who can do for the current President what Graham did for President Nixon “focus in on his nonpolitical leadership and speak out on Jimmy's decency as a human being.” Not long after Russo made his comment, Carter invited Graham, a fellow Southern Baptist, and Oral Roberts, the Oklahoma evangelist, to the White House. Maybe Carter's “Billy Graham” will turn out to be Billy Graham. Russo would also look for ways to portray the President as “a religious and philosphical leader,” not just another politician. “A boat trip down the Mississippi was nice,” said the Dole organizer, referring to a trip Carter made last summer, “but I'd rather see him addressing a religious convention.” Russo suggested that Carter might hitch a ride on the “cassock tails” — as one radio reporter put it ‐‐of Pope John Paul II. The photos showing Jimmy and John Paul together would be spread around like Farrah Fawcett posters. “The picture of Carter greeting the Pope was a great picture for him,” conceded the Republican consultant. “He looked good and the Pope looked good.” DIGNITY But that photo was taken only weeks after the most damaging picture of Carter's career, showing him near collapse during a foot race. Like the pictures of Edmund M. Muskie weeping in the New Hampshire snow or Gerald R. Ford falling down a flight of steps, the photo of a dazed and stumbling Jimmy Carter is worth the proverbial thousand words — and perhaps thousands of votes as well. Almost without exception, the consultants believe that Carter is squandering a key source of political capital. the aura and majesty that surround his office. “I think I would put him back to more dignified stance,” said Matt Reese, whose office is lined with dignified — and not so dignified — pictures of Kennedys. The President doesn't run up hills with a bunch of people, and he does, he doesn't collapse. People don't want their President to be too human.” If you don't play “Hail to the Chief,” this theory has it, people may stop thinking of you as the Chief. If you demystify the Presidency too much. you may lose what goes with the mystery. the power to inspire and uplift. “He's the first President,” said Jill Buckley, “who told us that our children's lives won't be better than our own. We all feel so insecure. People want somebody bigger and better than themselves.” BACK‐SCRATCHING As professionals in the field, the consultants were universally aghast at Jimmy Carter's failure to follow the first rule of politics: reward your friends and punish your enemies. To some of Carter's advisers, this political stance is a sign of unsullied virtue. But the experts thought it not so much virtuous as stupid. “Carter has spent the past three years being a real loner,” said Joe Rothstein, who has old ties to the Democratic liberal wing. “All kinds of people who worked for his election really got the back of his hand. It ‘s not a patronage thing, it's more a question of style — the arrogance they had left over from their primary election rhetoric: ‘We don't need anybody— we did it on our own.’ “ Matt Reese puts it this way: “If you're running for mayor, and you have limited resources, and it's September and October, you fix the streets in wards where you need votes. It's a time‐tested theory, and not the worst thing that's ever been done.” There are signs that Carter is starting to fix the streets in the crucial wards: $13 million in loans to a power cooperative in Humboldt, Iowa; transit and economic aid for Berlin, N.H.; funds for New York City hospitals. A prime example came during last month's caucuses in Florida. Carter was strewing Federal dollars around the way Johnny Appleseed planted trees — $19.9 million here for public housing in Dade County, $5 million there for a people mover at the Orlando airport. Asked about Carter's conspicuous generosity as he travels the country, Jody Powell said, “That's the way a President campaigns.” A President aiso campaigns by utilizing his considerable power to do personal favors, in the hope and expectation that they will be reciprocated. When he invites Catholic fund‐raisers to the White House to meet the Pope, or when Speaker of the House Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. is invited to sit in the Presi One consultant suggested three prime candidates for President Carter to use as scapegoats: Congress. OPEC and the big oil companies. They're all good targets. he commented somewhat sardonically. ‘because none have any credibility as institutions.’ dential box at the World Series, Carter shows the kind of back‐scratching skills the consultants approve of. And the tactics are already paying off. Reubin 0. Askew, the former Governor of Florida, was tapped last summer to be the President's chief trade negotiator. Last month, the grateful Askew returned home to extoll the virtues of his patron, and without a doubt, he will be back frequently before the primary in March. Bill Russo helped run Gerald Ford's campaign, and he knows what a rich political resource the Oval Office can be. He offered the following counsel: “In the early convention states, you have to pay special attention to your supporters and the party regulars. Invite them to the White House, make sure they get frequent calls. When you announce major policy decisions, let the county chairmen in Iowa know 12 hours early. Direct mail from the White House is also very impressive, even if it says at the bottom, ‘Not printed at Government expense.’ How often do you see a letter or an invitation from the White House on somebody's wall? If you're flying to California for a fund‐raiser, call the county chairmen in Black Hawk County from Air Force One while you're flying over Iowa. The President has to make a full‐out commitment to use the White House and the departments to support his reelection.” Bob Keefe believes that the appointment of Hamilton Jordan as White House chief of staff was primarily a political move, signaling Carter's intention to obtain that “full‐out commitment.” Said Keefe, “Hamilton has the ability and the authority to advise departments and agencies that they should be acting in the President's best interests.” The removal of Joseph A. Califano Jr., Brock Adams and W. Michael Blumenthal from the Carter Cabinet and the ascension of Moon Landrieu, Neil E. Goldschmidt and G. William Miller were clearly engineered, he suggests with the same aim in mind: put the President first. Several weeks ago, Carter told his Cabinet that he expected them to go out and sell his candidacy, and get rid of any subordinates who would not join the campaign team. This directive was followed up by a memo outlining “talking points” the Cabinet might use to promote Carter. One sample: emphasize the trouble Kennedy seems to have in defining why he wants to run for President. A politically minded Administration can be particularly persuasive with state and local officials, the ward bosses who want their streets fixed and need Federal money to do it. As Bob Teeter, another Ford veteran, puts it, “For the next year and a half, Carter controls their lifeblood.” Perhaps, then, Bob Keefe's reading is not so surprising: “One of Carter's greatest advantages is that he is very popular with elected officials mayors, city officials, governors. He's weak with political pros, state and county chairmen. But elected officials just eat him It is hardly an accident that Landrieu and Goldschmidt are both former mayors, well known and well liked be their erstwhile colleagues, nor is it an accident that they head two Cabinet departments, Housing and Urban Development and Transportation, that are critical to the fortunes of city and state officials. Neither man has to be told where to fix the streets. There are those who believe that political endorsements are no longer of any real value to a candidate, and certainly their importance has lessened. Old‐line organizations that could command unquestioned loyalty from voters are largely extinct outside of Chicago and perhaps the Bronx, wildlife preserves for party regulars. Thirty‐three states now hold primaries instead of conventions, and in this age of the independent voter it's hard to argue with the Democratic consultant who said, “Nobody delivers groceries in this country anymore and nobody delivers votes.” Still, as Carter adviser Bob Keefe noted, mayors and governors “have access to supportive people, and that's all an organization really is.” Local officials help raise money, for example, by energizing local donors or by lending a candidate their own fund raisers and lists of prospects. And Bob Keefe expresses the benefits of the endorsement game this way: “Local people can ,help sell the President's record. He has to do that to a large extent himself, but his appeal is tremendously enhanced if it's reinforced by people the voters might respect.” IMAGERY In the view of the consultants, Jimmy Carter's biggest problem is style, not substance — a lack of inspiration, not insight. In his own polls, Peter D. Hart reports, when voters are asked if they agree with the candidates on the issues, Carter and Kennedy run dead even. But when the question ranks effectiveness “in getting things done,” Kennedy racks up a 3‐to‐1 margin. To Bob Squires, the Carter film consultant, this means that voters are displaying a “spilt personality” — they want Kennedy's style of leadership but Carter's policies. Accordingly, Squires feels the President must conduct a “campaign of re‐education” to convince people that he has, really and truly, been a good leader. Squires has proposed, and the White House has agreed to make, a half‐hour campaign film that focuses on Carter behind the scenes, being the President. “We will show a man who is smart, quick and well educated in a lot of areas,” said Squires. “A man who is not afraid to face tough decisions and make them.” Squires thinks Carter must find a way to receive more credit for his successes. The film maker envisages a commercial based on interviews with ordinary workers: “There are a lot of people in this country who weren't at work last year and are 110w. We have to show that visually, show them at work, talk to them about it.” Unfortunately for those who would burnish the President's image, many of his most notable victories have a signal lack of political sex appeal. Civil Service reform, for example. Moreover, his most dramatic achievement to date has been a negative, the absence of war — the hardest kind of idea to sell the public. As Jill Buckley noted, “You can say, “Look what hasn't happened, there's no war.’ But if people are worried about paying their heating bills, that's not much consolation.” KENNEDY At least until the convention, the most important question for Jimmy Carter has to be, “How can Kennedy be cut down to size?” Or to put It another way: “How can the voters be made to realize that they're choosing Teddy, not Jack or Bobby?” Squires puts it in these terms: “You can't let Kennedy be Zeus, who comes back to earth for the inauguration.” Until recently, Carter has had to run in most polls against a “phantom candidate,” as Joe Napotitan put it, an image of perfection. But as soon as voters start focusing on real flesh‐and‐blood alternatives, in the persons of Ted Kennedy and California's Jerry Brown, the President's ratings should climb. Some surveys are already starting to reflect a Carter advance, and one explanation lies in the dynamics of the campaign: as the press scrutinizes Carter's rivals, their warts and blemishes become just as visible as his. Says Squires: “The sooner Kennedy's just another sweaty politician running for President, the better.” But the experts feel that Carter can leave nothing to chance, that he has to come out swinging. “Carter's got to put Kennedy on the defensive,” says David Keene, George Bush's manager. “He's got to go on the attack somehow.” And while the consultants have enormous regard for Kennedy's political acumen, they also point out that he is a relatively untested campaigner, a man who has never broken a sweat to win an How should Carter the candidate deal with Chappaquiddick and the whole issue of Ted Kennedy's ‘character’? The consensus among the consultants: he should stay away from it himself — in fact. he may already have said too much—and leave the job to surrogates. election. “Kennedy has never run for national office,” Keene says. When was the last time he had a tough race? I think he can be rattled. Once you force him out of his set piece, he's in trouble.” A Democratic organizer who did not want his name used put it even more bluntly: “You can't run Carter. You have to run against Kennedy and hope that he'll blow up or make a mistake.” In the relentless glare of a national campaign, that hope is not entirely unfounded. How many candidates — from George W. Romney to Ed Muskie to Thomas F. Eagleton — have self‐destructed under the pressure of a Presidential election? Many of the consultants interviewed suggested that Carter should take the risk and debate Kennedy, and the President has actually agreed to a face‐to‐face confrontation during the Iowa caucus campaign in January. The experts generally believed that the President would come across as a quicker, sharper debater than Kennedy, who failed to impress them during a TV interview with CBS correspondent Roger Mudd several weeks The tag that Carter must try to hang on Kennedy, in Mat Reese's words, is “Big Spender on the Left,•• a New Dealer who believes in more government and more taxes, a “bleeding‐heart liberal” from the 1960's who would bankrupt the country with his health‐insurance plans and other overly ambitious schemes. In fact, Carter is already sounding that theme every chance he gets. In an interview with Boston TV stations the President said: “Senator Kennedy is much more inclined toward the old philosophy of pouring out new programs and new money to meet a social need. ... I'm much more inclined to try to make existing programs work efficiently and start up new programs only when it's absolutely necessary.” To put it another way: since Carter cannot claim to have handled the economy well, he has to convince people that Kennedy would make an ever bigger mess. “Carter has to bell the cat,” said Bush adviser David Keene. “He's got to have someone out there saving, ‘If Teddy Kennedy were President, inflation would be 15 percent, and the Federal deficit would be three times what it is. Sure, he's attractive, but let's look at him. Teddy Kennedy is a leader in fighting for the things that have caused all of our problems!’” Another consultant would have Carter say, “When Ted Kennedy came to the Senate, the national debt was this. And now it's this.” “He has to make Kennedy part of the institutional problem. He has to make people say, ‘Hey, is that the guy I thought he was?’ “ One of the key differences between the two men was starkly evident at the dedication of the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston on Oct. 20. In his talk, Senator Kennedy said: “In dedicating this library to Jack, we can recall those years of grace, that time of hope. The spark still glows. The journey never ends. The dream shall never die.” But Carter stressed the differences between 1960 and 1980 “this age,” as he put it, “of scarce resources and hard choices.” The President's chances for re‐election could well turn on his ability to convince the public that in such an age of scarcity the country Without exception, the consultants felt that Kennedy will try to modify some of his positions, particularly on the issue of ‘'big government.” And in his speeches, the Senator is already attacking the “big spending programs” of the Carter Administration, particularly the President's proposal to allot $88 billion for synthetic‐fuel development. Like a well‐trained chorus, Kennedy aides have started to sing the refrain that their man is no “knee‐jerk liberal.” Yet as Mark Shields, a campaign consultant turned journalist, points out, Kennedy is vulnerable. He's been a “point man” in the Senate, an outspoken liberal rather than a trimmer or compromiser. “Carter has to pick those areas where Kennedy appears to be very left — civil liberties, social issues, pornography,” Shields says, “and separate Kennedy from his blue‐collar constituency.” Bob Dole's aide, Bill Russo, agrees: “Carter has to be ready to move to the right on social issues. There are important elements of the Catholic constituency that are open to persuasion away from Kennedy on matters such as abortion, busing, the importance of the That brings up the touchiest question of all: How does Carter deal with Chappaquiddick and the whole “character” issue? The consultants basically suggest that Carter should stay out of it, that he has probably said too much already by praising his own steadfastness in a crisis. But the experts also feel that the campaign to date does demonstrate Kennedy's vulnerability on the issue. Accordingly, says the consensus, Carter must use supporters to bring up the issue —a Reubin Askew or a Walter Mondale or a Robert S. Strauss. As Russo suggested: “Carter's got to have people out there who are saying, ‘Aren't you glad you have a President who can handle himself under pressure?'” Bob Teeter was even blunter: “At some point you really go after Kennedy, but Carter doesn't seem to have a hatchet man ready to bring this stuff out. He's got to try to paint Kennedy as a representative of the far left, of the permissive end of the country. He has to go back and pick up strong, working‐class Democrats on a traditional American‐values Another consultant suggested a TV spot aimed at the same purpose. “You open up on the White House,” goes the script, “with lots of martial music. You come in through the window and focus on a red telephone. A deep voice says, ‘As a result of the Cuban missile crisis, a hotline had been installed connecting Washington with Moscow. Since Jimmy Carter has been President, it has rung again and again — troop movements in Europe, warships in the Indian Ocean. The world, unaware, held its breath. Jimmy Carter faced the pressure. And he handled it.’ That would get the message across.” Surrogates — the polite term for hatchet men — have other uses, and one of them is to prod the press in certain directions. The Kennedys are absolute masters at manipulating journalists, and the consultants say that Carter has to play the same game. The voters should be continually reminded, they say, of Kennedy's cheating in college, of Chappaquiddick, of his marital troubles. David Keene suggests: “I'd have dozens of people talking off the record to dozens of reporters about Kennedy. You have to knock him off his Still, Carter cannot get too dirty. If he were to win the nomination, as Bob Keefe, who talks regularly to White House aides, points out, “He would need the support of that element of the party that is attracted to Kennedy. There's no sense getting into a fight that makes the post‐convetion wounds harder to splice together.” A final question: what about electoral strategy? Carter has basically committed himself to an all‐out push in every state, but John Sears thinks that's a mistake. According to his analysis, Carter's only natural base— if he has one at all — lies in the South. Therefore, argues Sears, Carter should write off the New Hampshire and Massachusetts primaries, two of the earliest tests, and concentrate his resources on Florida and other early Southern primary states, such as Alabama. After Carter takes a few of those, goes Sears's reasoning, “people will say, ‘Gosh, he won something.’ ” While Carter is unlikely to abandon New England entirely, he is certainly counting on victories in the South to catapult himself into the thick of the race. Building on that momentum, the President then heads for the key Middle Western primaries where neither he nor Kennedy has a decisive edge — Illinois and Indiana, for example. If Carter manages to hold his own there, Sears feels, he will be ready for the final round of big votes — California, Ohio and New Jersey. And with a few breaks, the peanut farmer from Plains could prove Conventional Wisdom wrong once again"

Iran Executes 2 It Says Operated A Prostitution and Abortion Ring,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/25/archives/iran-executes-2-it-says-operated-a-prostitution-and-abortion-ring.html,"TEHERAN, Iran, Nov. 24 (Reuters) —Two men were executed today after an Islamic revolutionary court found them guilty of running a prostitution and abortion ring in the northeastern city of Mashhad, the Pars news agency reported. Two other men were sentenced to three and a half years in prison each for drinking alcohol and for involvement in a prostitution ring, the agency said. One of them was also sentenced to 75 lashes."
News Summary,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/26/archives/new-summary-international.html,"An “urgent meeting” of the Security Council was called by Secretary General Kurt Waldheim of the United Nations to take up the Iranian crisis. He said the dispute could have “disastrous consequences for the entire world.” Mr. Waldheim said: “I don't know how the governments will react to this proposal,” which, he stressed, was made entirely on his own initiative. It was not yet known when the Council would meet. [Page A1, Column 6.] • Washington strongly backed Secretary General Waldheim's urgent call for a Security Council meeting on the Iranian crisis, expecting approval of a resolution demanding the release of the hostages. [A1:4.] • A Congressman visited the hostages and said that except for “a little cabin fever” they appeared to be healthy. Representative George Hansen, Republican of Idaho, who was on a self‐appointed mediation mission in Teheran, was permitted by their captors to speak to the hostages at the American Embassy. He met with Abolhassan Bani‐Sadr, the Acting Foreign Minister, and suggested that there might be a Congressional investigation of Iran's charges against the Shah. [A1:5.] • Israel ceded a major oilfield to Egypt in the biggest sacrifice it has made in carrying out the peace treaty between the two countries. As the Egyptian flag replaced Israel's at the Alma oilfield in the Gulf of Suez, the Israeli Minister of Energy, Yitzhak Modai, said, “I'm almost sick.” The Alma field had provided Israel with 20 percent of its oil needs and had the potential, according to Mr. Modai, of providing all of Israel's energy needs. [A1:3‐4.] • Saudi troops gained control of virtually all of the Grand Mosque in Mecca following a battle with the gunmen who seized it last Tuesday. Part of the mosque's basement was still occupied by the gunmen, according to Saudi officials and diplomatic sources. [A15:1.] National The free‐abortion controversy, temporarily settled in Congress through a compromise, is continuing in the courts. A Federal judge in Brooklyn is expected to rule soon, perhaps today, on the constitutionality of Congress's nearly total ban on paying for abortions for women on welfare. The Supreme Court is also preparing a decision that could say something about the constitutional issue raised in three appeals in an Illinois case. [A18:1‐2.] • Cancer cases have been reported among woodworkers in model design shops of major Detroit automobile plants and is being investigated by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. The inquiry was initiated by the Michigan Department of Public Health after a report in The Detroit News that in a 12‐year period there were 40 cancer deaths and 25 nonfatal cases among an unspecified number of woodworkers at General Motors and Chrysler. [A18:4‐5.] • A priest who supports the ordination of women has been ordered to leave his activist community near Washington by the Father General of the Society of Jesus. The Rev. William J. Callahan has been accused of disobeying an order from the Father General, the Rev. Pedro Arrupe, to stop advocating the ordination of women. [B10:4‐5.] • Some Mormon women are troubled by a conflict between their church and supporters of the proposed equal rights amendment. One feminist Mormon has been accused of apostasy and will undergo a church trial next month, with a possible sentence of excommunication. The church hierarchy believes that the amendment is a threat to the family — which for Mormon women is of primary importance. [B9:1‐6.] Metropolitan New York University is expanding its arts and sciences program and is adding a substantial number of young faculty members. Although a financial crisis five years ago threatened its existence, it is one of the nation's few major universities planning an increase in curriculums and faculty. Its new solvency was aided by the sale for $115 million in 1976 of the C.F. Mueller Company, noodle manufacturers, which N.Y.U. had owned through a trust fund established by alumni and friends of its Law School. [A1:2.] • The Waldorf‐Astoria was like bedlam when a $2 million computerized telephone sytem that had just been installed went haywire. The confusion was compounded when many guests could not find their rooms because room numbers had been changed to conform with the new telephone system. A failure in the computer circuit apparently was responsible for the breakdown. Service was restored when the repairs were made. [A1:11 • Robbers took at least $100,000 in cash and jewelry from safe deposit boxes in the Mayfair Regent, a hotel at 65th Street and Park Avenue, and the police said the amount could be much higher. One of the five well‐dressed holdupmen was a guest at the hotel. [B1:4‐6.] • When an elevator cable snapped and the car with its 10 passengers plunged seven stories to the basement of the Midway Hotel at 216 West 100th Street in Manhattan, no one was seriously injured. City inspection officials said they could not recall another instance in which an elevator equipped with an emergency brake was not halted when its cable broke. [131 :1‐2.] • A Cuban refugee leader was killed by gunmen in Union City, N.J., and antiCastro extremists were believed to be responsible. Eulalio José Negrin, who had urged moderation among anti‐Castro exile groups, was slain by a fusillade from semiautomatic weapons as he stepped into his car. [B2:1‐3.]"
4‐Year Dispute Over Free Abortion Is Going Into Federal Courts Again,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/26/archives/4-year-dispute-over-free-abortion-is-going-into-federal-courts.html,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 25 — The fouryear controversy over free abortions, settled temporarily again in Congress, is about to unfold further in the courts. Soon, perhaps tomorrow, areaerai judge in Brooklyn is expected to rule on the constitutionality of Congress, s nearly total ban on free abortions for women on welfare. The Supreme Court is also preparing to act; it, too, could say something about the constitutional issue. Three appeals in an Illinois case offer the Justices a chance to take up that issue promptly. Even pro‐abortion groups that most want the dispute settled, however, have asked the Justices to pass up that chance now and wait for the Brooklyn case to reach them. Ultimately, only the Court can settle the controversy over the so‐called “Hyde amendment,” a dispute that affects poor women's access to abortions. It is also an increasingly explosive issue that ties up Congress every year. The amendment is named for its sponsor, Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois. Since 1976, the forces in and out of Congress that oppose abortion have displayed growing strength, and the Hyde amendment is the most visible sign of their power. The amendment has existed in three forms over the past four years, but each form has put strict limits on the Federal Government's authority to pay for abortions. Pays for Only 2,000 As the law now stands, the Government may pay for only about 2,000 abortions a year, compared with nearly 300,000 a year before Congress imposed limits. The Supreme Court has been drawn into the controversy three times, but it still has not settled Congress's power to restrict abortion payments. Two years ago, the Court ruled that Congress need not pay for “voluntary” abortions — those not medically necessary. But it said then that the issue could be different if women on welfare who needed abortions for health reasons were denied Federal Medicaid insurance. In its most recent action, Congress cut off Medicaid payments for any medically necessary abortion unless the pregnancy threatened the woman's life. Beyond those cases, the only ones covered by Medicaid are those to end pregnancies caused by rape or incest. The Brooklyn jurist who is on the verge of issuing a new decision, District Judge John J. Dooling, ruled once before that the Hyde amendment was unconstitutional. That ruling barred its enforcement for a year. But in 1977 the Justices ordered him to reconsider. Religious Reason Asserted In the renewed challenge before Judge Dooling, pro‐abortion forces have repeated the arguments about discrimination against poor women. They have added a new assertion — that the amendment is unconstitutional because Congress passed it to promote a religious cause, the “pro‐life” views of anti‐abortion forces, especially the Roman Catholic Church. Another Federal judge, John F. Grady of Chicago, ruled last April 29 that the Hyde amendment was unconstitutional as it applied to women who need abortions in the first two trimesters of pregnancy. Judge Grady indicated that he was reluctant to rule on the constitutional issue because it had not been raised directly in the test case before him. But the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit had ruled earlier that the constitutional issue had to be decided. Chicago Decision Appealed Now, the Federal Government, Illinois welfare officials and two “pro‐life” doctors in Illinois have appealed Judge Grady's decision to the Supreme Court. When the Court acts on those appeals, it could agree to rule on the constitutional dispute. But it may also agree to rule only on the question of whether the Hyde amendment gives states permission to cut off funds for medically necessary abortions. That question can be settled on the basis of Federal welfare law, not the Constitution. A ruling could make a major difference to women on welfare who need abortions. It would not, however, bring an end to the controversy; apparently only a constitutional decision could do that. The case in Brooklyn raises that constitutional question in a clear‐cut way. However Judge Dooling rules, that case is sure to go on to the Supreme Court. If the Justices hold off a constitutional decision until they reach that case, it could mean the dispute would go unsettled for at least another year."
Many Mormon Women Feel Torn Between Equal Rights Proposal and Church,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/26/archives/many-mormon-women-feel-torn-between-equal-rights-proposal-and.html,"SALT LAKE CITY, Nov. 25— For Mormon feminists, who began organizing in the early 1970's, and for more traditional Mormon women, the proposed equal rights amendment has been a source of Dain and conflict. It has become a source of fear, too, for those who support it, since a Mormon feminist has been accused of apostasy and will soon stand church trial with a possible sentence of excommunication. Mormonism is much more than a Sunday kind of religion. It is an environment and the only community most of its members know, even those who are not active in the church. The theology of the church, whose formal name is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter‐day Saints, is complex. While it emphasizes free will and the perfectibility of man, it also teaches that the sons — and daughters — of perdition, including apostate Mormons, will be cast out and sentenced to eternal punishment. ‘Now I Am Afraid’ “I am, for the first time, frightened,” said Jinnah Kelson, a gentle‐spoken, middle‐aged woman who describes herself as a “non‐active Mormon.” She said: “Up until now, I have felt that it was a matter of education on the E.R.A., of getting logical reason across. But now I am afraid.” Sonia Johnson, the woman who is to be tried next week before three bishops, including the one who accused her of attacking the church in her campaign for the amendment, is the leader of a group called Mormons for E.R.A., which has about 500 members. The group's cause is clearly opposed by the church hierarchy, which views the amendment as a threat to the family and contends that it will erase legal protections that women now have. Nevertheless, spokesmen at church headquarters here say that the charges against Sonia Johnson are a “local matter” — she lives in Sterling Park, Va. — and were not brought as a result of her work for the amendment. Mrs. Johnson is a fifth‐generation Mormon. She and Marilee Latta, president of the Utah Equal Rights Coalition, still consider themselves active church members. But the other feminist Mormons who were interviewed think of themselves as falling away or, as many of them put it, being driven away. One woman said, after a painfully self-deprecating laugh, “Oh, I'm just an apostate now.” Among the most apparently devout and observant Mormon women, very few of whom describe themselves as feminists, the general reaction to interviewers is: “Oh, but I am not a typical Mormon woman.” Not typical, they say, because they have doubts, because they have questions, because they feel conflict and pressure. They steer the interviewers to other women, who in turn end up saying, “But I am not a typical Mormon woman.” The highest‐ranking woman in the church is Barbara B. Smith, the redoubtable president of the Relief Society, the women's auxiliary of the church. She is the full‐time, unpaid head of an immense and extraordinary social welfare agency that has about 1.5 million members in 70 countries, with 20,000 officers and teachers. A Center of Life The Relief Society is one of the centers of a Mormon woman's life; upwards of 70 percent participation in a ward, or parish, is not unusual. Members meet once a week. One lesson a month is devoted to spiritual concerns, the next to homemaking skills, the third week is for social relationships — husbands, neighbors, children, community — and the fourth week, said Mrs. Smith, “for culture and refinement” — that is, lessons on art, music and literature. It is said among Mormon women that going to Relief Society meetings for sev oral years is the equivalent of a college education, although what is done with the standardized material sent from headquarters depends on the individual teachers. Karen Shepherd, a college professor and a non‐active Mormon, said, “Some of the best lectures I have ever heard were given in Relief Society.” The emphasis on homemaking skills is a daily duty for Mormon women. Food preparation for their families is a daily reminder of a religion that, in addition to prohibiting coffee, tea, liquor and tobacco, encourages cooking plain food from scratch for the sake of higher nutrition and lower expense. Mormon women are also encouraged to make their own and their children's clothes. Opposed to Birth Control According to Mormon theology, there are three spheres, and, in the lowest of them, spirits waiting to be born. Mormons believe it is not a good thing to deny a human shell to a waiting spirit — the church president, Spencer Kimball, said in this regard not long ago, “Everyone hates waiting in line — and this is the source of their opposition to birth control and abortion. So the woman Mormons see as “typical” has five or more children, bakes her own bread, cans her own fruit, makes her family's clothes. And that is just the beginning of what the church expects of her — as of a Mormon man, who must tithe and go on evangelical missions, as well as devote a great deal of time to church business and to the family. Outside the home, Mormon women have the Relief Society duties of visiting the sick, the lame, the halt and the blind — even those who suffer from “deviant behavior.” And every Mormon woman is expected to educate herself for a career and to pursue it as fully as is consonant with responsibility to her family. In the opinion of Mormon feminists, all these duties have a great deal to do with the anxiety, stress, depression and suicide that they contend are widespread among Mormon women. A Problem of All Women “I'm so tired of hearing about depression among Mormon women,” said Bonnie Le Fevre, a homemaker and registered nurse. “It isn't just a Mormon problem. All kinds of women get depressed.” Marilyn Warenski, a former Mormon who interviewed scores of women for her book “Patriarchs and Politics: The Plight of the Mormon Woman,” points out that the church, for all its patriarchal features, offers a sense of purpose and belonging to its members. Mormon women can be wonderfully helpful to one another, bringing food and cheer in times of illness or crisis. Yet, according to many Mormon women, they do not share their doubts or feelings of insecurity with one another. “It is because we are set up to be competitive,” said Beth Jarman, a former Utah state legislator. “My petunias have to be prettier than your petunias.” ‘They Do Not Understand’ Barbara Smith does not question the church's male authorities. She does know Sonia Johnson and considers her “a warm, loving and caring person.” She says of the feminists in the church, “They do not understand. We are for equal rights for women. We are for equal pay for equal work. “But the E.R.A. is a piece of legislation like many others before it: It will not do what it is intended to do. It will have effects it was not intended to have.” Ah, said the questioner, if we could all see over the hump of time, there would be no problem about how to proceed. Barbara Smith said with a direct stare: “But the Prophet can so see. And if you know that, you know there is no further need for discussion.” So far, though, the problem has indeed been discussed. “My grandmother told me we had a right to question, that is how I know,” said Lynne Van Dam, who says she became an inactive Mormon in the bitter aftermath of Utah's 1977 International Women's Year convention, which was dominated by Relief Society women bitterly opposed to the proposed amendment. Like all frontier women, the early fe:; male saints were exempted from all manner of Victorian tomfoolery about the delicacy of females. As he built the church kingdom, Brigham Young was often short‐handed because the ever-evangelizing Mormons kept sending their men off on missions. So he drafted women in their stead, announcing by ukase that women were just as well equipped as men to be accountants, lawyers, doctors and business managers. In Pursuit of Careers Intermingled with all this was the Mormon institution of plural marriage. While sister wives took care of husband and children, others could study or pursue careers, and many of them did. Eliza R. Snow, plural wife of both Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, Dr. Ellis Shipp, Susa Young Gates — writer, teacher and suffragist — these early Mormon “superwomen” have been held up as models for generations. But as the kingdom became more settled and plural marriage became a thing of the past, Mormon women were encouraged to stay home. Like Rosie the Riveter after World War II, they were suddenly surplus labor. Mormonism teaches that the family will stay together in the celestial kingdom. Since women are not allowed into the church's lay priesthood, which effectively includes all men, a woman can receive the spiritual and material benefits of advancement in the priesthood only through her husband. If a woman does not marry, she will not have full status in the celestial kingdom but will serve as a “ministering angel” to others. Thus the church is highly sensitive about anything it perceives as a threat to the family. When, in 1972, Congress passed an amendment decreeing that “equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex,” the Church did not at first see it as a threat. Beth Jarman was elected to the state legislature that fall in an all-Mormon community, running openly on a platform supporting the amendment. Called a ‘Communist Plan’ But when the state ratification vote came up in 1973, a group called the HOTDOGS — Humanitarians Opposed to the Degradation of Our Girls, whose leaders were also members of the John Birch Society and of the Relief Society — was denouncing the amendment as part of “the Communist plan,” “the ultimate maneuver to bring about the complete breakdown of family life.” The legislators and the Governor were deluged with mail. On the eve of the opening of the 1975 session, The Deseret News, the churchowned evening newspaper in Salt Lake, published an unsigned anti‐amendment editorial in the church news section in a space usually reserved for church policy statements. Mr. Kimball, who, Mormons believe, was speaking in the editorial, has declared the amendment a “moral issue” and consequently one of concern to the church. Overnight, support for the amendment in the House of Representatives dropped from 34 to 16, and it was defeated by a 2 to 1 ratio. The church also helped defeat the amendment in Nevada and was behind the Idaho attempt to rescind in 1976. Money raised among Mormons has been sent to support anti‐amendment work in states that have yet to ratify it. Questions on Tax Status The question is now being raised by some Mormons and by feminists as to whether the church has violated separation of church and state and even whether its tax‐exempt status should be questioned because of its political activities. Many of the activists have signed a fullpage ad in support of Sonia Johnson that is to run in the Tuesday papers in Salt Lake. They feel they have crossed the Rubicon. “There is no going back into the closet now,” said Karen Shepherd. Marilee Latta, who is fervently religious, believed that if President Kimball would just pray for a revelation, the Lord would tell him to support the rights amendment. “I know that is true,” she said, “I have had revelation on this subject and so has Sonia and so have many others.” While Mrs. Latta is praying that the church will be enlightened, good Mormons like Mrs. Smith are praying that Sonia Johnson, Mrs. Latta and their group will see the light as the church sees it. They are praying for each other. It is all very Mormon. Above, Barbara B. Smith, of the Mormon Relief Society. Left, Marilee Latta, and below, Jinnah Kelson, left, and Lynne Van Dam."
News Summary,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/27/archives/news-summary-international.html,"TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 27, 1979 International A partial American evacuation from about 10 Moslem countries was announced by the State Department, which said that dependents, nonessential personnel and private businessmen should “voluntarily” leave those countries to minimize risks in the aftermath of the turmoil in Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, the White House held to its position on Iran, saying it would reject any arrangement that did not begin with the unconditional release of all 49 American hcstages in Teheran. [Page Al, Column 6.] ● An appeal for the immediate release of American hostages in Iran was being prepared by the United Nations Security Council. The members weighed whether to issue the appeal from the council or its president. [Al :4‐5. ] ● Iran's leaders seemed divided over a request by Secretary General Waldheim for a United Nations Security Council meeting. Officials said they had asked for a week's delay in the meeting so that Iran could clarify its positions. But the Iranians’ price for releasing 42 American hostages still appeared to be a surrender of the deposed Shah for trial in Iran. [Al :51 ● The financial dealings of the Shah, his family and associates are being investigated by the revolutionary Government of Iran, which began to publicize some findings. An official said that records showed almost $800 million in loans by 12 banks in Iran, none apparently American controlled, made to the Shah's two sisters and associates on unusually generous terms. [A10:4‐6.j ● The arrest of 96 South Koreans, including former legislators and a prominent civil rights leader, was announced in Seoul.

Supreme Court Roundup Curb on Abortion Payments for Poor Faces Review,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/27/archives/supreme-court-roundup-curb-on-abortion-payments-for-poor-faces.html,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 26 — The Supreme Court announced today that would hear arguments on whether it is constitutional for the Federal Government to refuse to pay for abortions for poor women whose doctors believe the procedure to be medically necessary. The Court tentatively accepted three appeals from a decision of a United States District Court in Illinois that, last April, declared unconstitutional the Hyde Amendment, the four‐year‐old Congressional ban on Medicaid financing for most abortions. The Federal Government, the State of Illinois and an antiabortion group called Americans United for Life filed the appeals. The tentative nature of the Court's action today stems from questions over whether the constitutional issue was properly raised in the unusually complicated lower court proceedings. The Justices will reach the merits of the case only if they decide, after hearing the arguments next spring, that they actually have jurisdiction. Whatever the outcome, today's action assures that the High Court will be back in the spotlight on the highly emotional abortion issue. It also appears likely to focus public attention on the Carter Administration's views on the issue. The Federal Government was not originally party in the Illinois lawsuit but entered the case to defend the constitutionality of the Congressional financing ban. Contrast in Federal Payments The issue before the Court in the three cases (Williams v. Zbaraz, No. 79‐4; Quern v. Zbaraz, No. 79‐5; and U.S. v. Zbaraz, No. 79‐491) is whether it is constitutionally permissible for the Government to refuse to pay for medically necessary abortions when it pays for essentially all other medically necessary procedures for women who are eligible for Medicaid, the Federal health program. In a case two years ago, Maher v. Roe, the Court ruled that states had no constitutional obligation to pay for elective abortions. That case, however, did not involve the question of “medically necessary” abortions raised by today's cases. One of the original plaintiffs in the Illinois lawsuit was a pregnant 38‐year‐old woman suffering from varicose veins and blood clots. Three doctors testified that if she were forced to carry the pregnancy to term she had a 30 percent risk of developing thrombophlebitis, which would require prolonged hospitalization. District Court Opinion In striking down the financing ban, the district court said that while, under the Maher decision, “a state may legitimately prefer childbirth to an elective abortion,” nonetheless “we cannot hold that a state has a legitimate interest in preserving the life of a nonviable fetus at the cost of increased maternal morbidity and mortality among indigent pregnant women.” The Hyde Amendment, named for its sponsor, Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois, has been attached by Congress as a rider to various appropriation bills over the last four years. It restricts Medicaid financing to cases in which the pregnancy is endangering the woman's life or is a result of rape or incest. Originally, the permissible category also included pregnancies that would result in “severe and long‐lasting physical health damage,” but Congress this year eliminated financing for that group of In urging the Supreme Court to hear the appeal, the Justice Department argued that Congress had made a rational “policy judgment,” embodying “its strong and legitimate interest in encouraging childbirth.” Returning from their two‐week Thanksgiving recess, the Justices announced actions in some 150 cases today, including these: Illegal Evidence The Court granted a Government request to decide whether illegally seized evidence, which the prosecution is barred from introducing at trial as part of its main case, can nonetheless be used to impeach the credibility of a defendant who testifies falsely on cross‐examination. The Justice Department has lost this issue in four courts of appeals. In this case, U.S. v. Havens, No. 79‐305, the appeals court overturned the narcotics conviction of an Indiana lawyer who said in his direct testimony that he knew nothing about the narcotics transaction. The trial judge allowed the Federal prosecutor, on cross‐examination, to introduce an illegally seized undershirt that cast doubt on the defendant's denials. By barring such evidence from the cross‐examination phase, the Government said in urging the Justices to take the case, the lower courts have given defendants “a license to commit perjury without fear of impeachment.” The case gives the Court a chance, if it chooses, to narrow the scope of the socalled exclusionary rule. Eight years ago, in a decision called Harris v. N.Y., the Court used a similar opportunity to rule that evidence obtained in violation of a defendant's Miranda rights can be used to impeach the defendant's testimony on direct examination. Today's case involves the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable search, rather than the Fifth Amendment's protection against self‐incrimination that underlies the Miranda rule. Sex Discrimination Despite the Government's request to hear its appeals, the Court let stand three lower court decisions holding that the Department of Health, Education and Welfare does not have the legal right to cut off Federal funds from schools and colleges that discriminate against female employees. The department had sought to cut off the funds under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits sex discrimination in education institutions receiving Federal funds. However, the three appeals courts, in separate cases, ruled that Title IX was intended to prohibit discrimination aainst students and does not cover employment practices. Since more than half of the Title IX complaints received by H.E.W. involve employment discrimination, the department viewed the adverse decisions as serious setback. Other cases involving the issue are now in other Federal courts, so the Supreme Court might agree to take up the question at a later date. (Hams v. Isleboro School Committee, No. 79‐200). Indians' Rights The Court agreed to hear a Government appeal from a decision holding that the Bureau of Indian Affairs must award highway‐building contracts through public, competitive bidding. The bureau argues that under the Buy Indian Act, a 1910 law, it can bar non‐Indians from bidding on its contracts. A non‐Indian construction company successfully challenged the Indian‐only policy. In urging the Supreme Court not to take the Government's appeal, the company said that the Indian‐only policy served only to “generate windfall profits for wealthy businessmen of marginal Indian blood.” The Indian Nations Construction Company, which won the $1.2million contract in dispute, is owned by three men: one a lawyer who is one‐quarter Seminole; one a one‐quarter Choctaw with a net worth of $455,000; and one non‐Indian with a net worth of $1.3 million. (Andrus v. Glover Construction Co., No. 79‐48). Long Sentence The Court agreed to hear the appeal of an Oklahoma man sentenced to a mandatory prison term of 40 years under a state law that imposed the special sentence for a third felony conviction. His third conviction was for the sale of $25 worth of heroin; the earlier convictions were for burglary and assault. The state courts subsequently declared the law unconstitutional but refused to modify his sentence. (Hicks v. Okla., No. 78‐5885). Church Cases In related cases, the Court refused to interfere with private lawsuits charging the United Methodist Church with fraud and securities law violations in connection with the bankruptcy of seven retirement homes it ran on the West Coast. The church and several of its officials argued that they could not be sued because the church structure is nonhierarchical, composed of independent units without a central management. Both the California Court of Appeal and the Federal appeals court there rejected the argument. (Milhouse v. District Court, No. 78‐1855; United Methodist Church v. Barr, No. 79245)."
Feeding the Unborn: Some Diet Wisdom For Mothers‐to‐Be,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/28/archives/feeding-the-unborn-some-diet-wisdom-for-motherstobe-personal-health.html,"THERE is probably no time in life when good nutrition is more crucial to your future than when you can least control what you eat — before you are born. Your grandmother was right: a pregnant woman is indeed “eating for two.” But what she eats is even more important than how much. No doubt the vast majority of mothers‐to‐be, given half a chance by the circumstances of life, try to feed their unborn children right. Unfortunately, many women — and sometimes the doctors who care for them — know more myth than fact about maternal nutrition and end up accomplishing little good and possibly causing some harm. Much that has been learned through research in recent years about maternal nutrition runs counter to longstanding beliefs. Pregnant women may spend fortunes on vitamin supplements, watch their weight very carefully, or cut out salt, all in the name of a better baby, when in fact such measures may be unnecessary or undesirable. At the same time, pregnant women may fail to consume enough of the foods that do make a difference to the baby's development and to their own well‐being. Despite what many think, the developing fetus is not a completely successful parasite, able to extract all it needs from its mother, no matter how badly she may feed herself. The fetus takes some nutrients, like iron and calcium, from the mother at her expense. But the fetus can't meet all its needs from a nutritionally deficient mother. In general, the worse the mother's diet, the worse the baby's chances for a good start in life and, of course, the less able the mother will be to cope with the stresses of pregnancy and delivery. Actually, good maternal nutrition begins before a woman even becomes pregnant. Those who start off underweight are more likely to deliver babies that are dangerously small, even if they eat and gain normally during pregnancy. And women who are obese when they conceive are more likely to develop high blood pressure and encounter difficulties with delivery that could jeopardize the baby as well as the mother. But, the experts warn, pregnancy is no time to try to shed extra pounds. Dieting during pregnancy can deprive the baby of an adequate supply of protein and other essential nutrients, which could impair development of the baby's brain and body. Also, the breakdown of fat when you lose weight releases toxic substances called ketone bodies that could harm the baby. In a national study of 53,500 births, the babies of overweight mothers who gained little during pregnancy were twice as likely to die shortly before or after birth than the babies of heavy women with larger weight gains. Although in decades past women were chastised if they gained more than 10 or 15 pounds during the nine months of pregnancy, it's now known that on the average 24 to 27 pounds is the appropriate amount of weight to gain (one and a half to three pounds the first three months, and one pound every nine days thereafter). The accompanying chart shows where these pounds go. The few pounds of fat the mother stores are needed for nursing. According to the national study, women who start pregnancy at a normal weight do best if they gain about 20 pounds and those who start out underweight should gain 30 pounds. But a weight gain of more than 32 pounds also increases the risk to the baby, no matter how thin the mother was when she conceived. The caloric cost of pregnancy adds up to about 80,000 calories, assuming you maintain your normal level of activity. Therefore you need to consume an extra 300 calories a day during pregnancy. That's the amount in a generous scoop of ice cream, so you obviously can't eat everything in sight. Rather, you have to make those added calories count toward the extra nutrients you need. Pregnancy significantly increases the need for protein, calcium, iron and the B vitamin folacin. Milk (or a milk equivalent like cheese, yogurt or cottage cheese) is the best source of calcium. The milk doesn't have to be drunk. You can add it in liquid or powdered form to puddings, soups, baked goods, hot cereal, casseroles, meat loaves and many other prepared foods. Other calcium sources include broccoli, spinach, kale and mustard greens, but the calcium from vegetables is less readily absorbed. If you can't drink regular milk because of an inability to digest milk sugar (lactose intolerance), you should have no trouble with hard, unprocessed cheeses like cheddar or swiss. And you may be able to handle cultured milk products like yogurt and buttermilk, as long as they don't contain added milk solids. Or you can try acidophilus milk in which the lactose is predigested by bacteria or treat ordinary milk with the enzyme Lact‐Aid, available through pharmacies or from the Sugarlo Company, 3540 Atlantic Avenue, P.O. Box 1017, Atlantic City, N.J. 08404. Four cups of milk or yogurt supply the daily recommended amount of calcium. The calcium equivalent of one cup of milk is supplied by 11 ounces of cheddar, 13/4 cups of ice cream or two cups of cottage cheese. At the same time, a quart of milk would provide the needed amounts of vitamins A and D and two‐fifths of the day's protein needs. Calcium pills are not a recommended way of getting the mineral. • • • In addition to the milk, to get enough protein you would need to eat at least three servings of meat, fish, poultry, beans, peanut butter or eggs a day. If vegetable protein is used to meet the day's requirements, be sure it's properly balanced in essential amino acids. This is achieved by combining grains with beans or nuts or by combining any of these with dairy products in the same meal. Good sources of iron include dried fruits, liver, kidneys, prune juice and dried beans. However, few pregnant women consume enough of this mineral, so vital to the health of blood cells. Therefore, iron supplements of 30 to 60 milligrams a day are recommended during pregnancy. Folacin may also be given as a supplement. Pregnancy doubles the folacin requirement, and if a woman is deficient in folacin, the risk of spontaneous abortion and fetal damage is increased. It is found primarily in leafy green vegetables, and in broccoli, asparagus, peanuts, mung bean sprouts and liver. Vitamin B‐6 may also be needed in unusual amounts to support the development of the baby's nervous system. It is found in whole grain bread and cereal, liver, spinach, green beans, bananas, poultry, fish, meats, nuts, potatoes, and green leafy vegetables. Pregnancy also increases your need for other B vitamins, but enough of these are supplied by the increased calories you eat, assuming they come from nutritious foods, not sweets and fats. Whole grain bread and cereal, organ meats, milk, nuts and wheat germ are good sources of B vitamins. For vitamins A and C, include citrus fruits and juices and other fruits and vegetables (including at least one dark green or deep yellow vegetable) in your daily diet. If your drinking water is not fluoridated, consult your doctor about fluoride supplements to help protect your baby's teeth, which form before birth under the gums. Liquids — six to eight glasses a day in addition to milk — are also important to maintain the increased body fluids of pregnancy and to counter the natural tendency to become constipated (also countered by eating high‐fiber foods like whole grains, fruits and vegetables). But stick primarily to water, unsweetened fruit juices and vegetable juices. Excessive caffeine may be damaging, and soft drinks are nutritionally empty. • • • Now for the don'ts. Don't restrict salt (sodium), the need for which is significantly increased during pregnancy. Sodium is not the cause of toxemia of pregnancy; poor nutrition, especially inadequate protein, is the more likely root of this hazardous swelling of tissues and increase in blood pressure. Use only iodized or sea salt. Don't drink more than two alcoholic drinks on any given day, and no more than one drink a day on a regular basis. Heavy drinking during pregnancy has been linked to a spectrum of damages to the baby, including facial, heart and joint abnormalities, growth retardation before and after birth, mental deficiency and behavioral abnormalities, including hyperactivity. Even a moderate amount of alcohol — an average of one and a half drinks a day— may be linked to lowered birth weight. And don't sacrifice your unborn child to an ideology that may compromise his or her nutritional welfare. Dr. Judith J. Wurtman, biologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, points out in her book, “Eating Your Way Through Life,” (Raven Press, New York), “Vegetarians, who may eliminate eggs and dairy products as well as meat and fish from their diets, or members of the macrobiotic community, whose diet consists primarily of grains and vegetables, may not be able to obtain the required amounts of protein, iron or calcium from the limited variety of foods they eat.” Dr. Wurtman also warns against excessive consumption of vitamin C during pregnancy, which can cause the baby to require unusually large amounts of the vitamin. After birth, the baby may develop scurvy consuming the normal amount of vitamin C. Diet Guide for Pregancy An excellent practical guide to good nutrition during pregnancy is a 16‐page booklet, “As You Eat, So Your Baby Grows,” by Nikki Goldbeck. It can be obtained for $1.25 including postage by writing to Ceres Press, Old Witch Tree Road, Woodstock, N.Y. 12998. Physicians and midwives can obtain bulk orders — $15 for 50 copies, $26 for 100 copies, including shipping costs."
‘Hard-to-Place’ Children Find Homes Through Newspapers,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/30/archives/hardtoplace-children-find-homes-through-newspapers-families-with.html,"Norman Kulp, an electric motor repairman, and his wife Carol have six children, ranging in age from 21 to 8. Matthew, the youngest, suffers from Down's syndrome, or mongolism. A year ago last summer, the Kulps read a story in The Rochester Democrat & Chronicle about David, a 15. year‐old boy, and Suzie, a 9-year-old girl, who also have Down's syndrome. David and Suzie, known to social workers as hard-to-place children, had been brought up in a foster home by a widow who could no longer keep them. With great trepidation, Mrs. Kulp called the Council of Adoptive Parents (“Scariest thing I've ever done,” she said) to find out if there were subsidies available to help care for such children. She was told there were, and as a result, on David's 16th birthday, he and Suzie were adopted by the Kulps and brought home to live in their eightroom, 100-year-old house in Honeoye Falls, just south of Rochester. “They blended right in,” said Mrs. Kulp happily. “We can handle them and they enhance our lives. They help us to stop and smell the flowers.” For the last 11 years, hard-to-place children like David and Suzie, who were once virtually written off by adoption agencies, have found adoptive homes through newspaper columns. The children, many of them from minority groups and many of them teenagers, include those with low mental abilities, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, severe emotional problems, hyperactivity, arthritis, blindness, deafness and even terminal illnesses. Families With Siblings The response to these columns has been overwhelming. The “A Child Is Waiting” column in The Detroit News placed 329 children in nine years. These included families of five and, in one case, six siblings. The Boston Globe received 1,600 telephone calls in the first two years of its column and placed 75 out of the 98 children described.In Canada, where the “Today's Child” feature was syndicated in newspapers throughout the Province of Ontario, 8,000 children were featured in 13 years, 85 percent of whom were placed with families as a result. Most columns are concerned with one child at a time, describing his or her history and carefully defining the child's problems. Among the newspapers that run regular columns on hardto‐place children are The Cleveland A Detroit paper's column has found adoptive parents for 329 children. Plain Dealer, The Chicago Sun‐Times, The Philadelphia Inquirer, The St. Petersburg Independent, The Columbia [S.C.] State and The Newark StarLedger. Marilyn Brown, a reporter with The St. Petersburg Independent, said, “Two years ago, I found out that the Family Counseling Center had just gotten money for hard-to-place kids, so thought, why not do a monthly column on kids?” Miss Brown said that at last count the column had dealt with 23 children, 18 of whom had been adopted. The counseling center picks out the child, then Miss Brown interviews the child and the foster parents before writing the column. One of the children she wrote about was Kristen, a stuttering, 10-year-old girl with a history of epileptic seizures. Miss Brown visited Kristen two years after she had been adopted and found a happy, suntanned girl who had gained 10 pounds and grown four inches, who could see well for the first time because an eye problem had been diagnosed, and who was getting A's in school. “She was just an entirely different child,” Miss Brown said. “In fact, she finally showed her new family, whom she loves, how she used to fake her seizures.” An 11-month-old girl who was the subject of Miss Brown's column had to have both her eyes removed because of cancer. As a result of the column, she was adopted by a family in Texas and is now described as “the star of her prenursery class.” The greatest response to Miss Brown's column was for a 10-year-old white girl with not too many problems. A blind, retarded, black boy with a great many problems got no response at all. The adoption picture has changed drastically in recent years, in great part because of the relaxation in abortion laws and because many mothers are keeping babies born out of wedlock. The upshot is there are virtually no healthy white babies available for adoption. This has in turn changed the requirements for adoptive families. Children were once matched to their adoptive parents by race, religion, appearance and intelligence. Now the question asked is: What family can give the love this child needs? Single parents are sometimes deemed better able to handle the needs of these hard-to-place children, and lower-middle-class families are often found to have a higher tolerance for the children's problems than families who are accustomed to more comfortable lives. Still a Popular Column The first of the columns to appear in this country was written by Ruth Carlton in The Detroit News in 1968, and it is still one of the best‐read of these columns today. In 1961 Miss Carlton had had her first experience with reader response to adoption. She wrote a story saying that there were 3,000 children available for adoption in Wayne County, Mich. To the dismay of the startled adoption agencies, who had not known about Miss Carlton's story beforehand, 2,500 families responded and the agen- cies simply could not handle the response. In August 1968, her first “A Child Is Waiting” column featured a 6-year-old white boy and ran his picture. The column evoked 254 responses. “One thing that has definitely been changed by the column is the agencies' views about the adoptability of black children,” Miss Carlton said. “There is no problem recruiting families, and every agency in town has found that black children are adoptable.” Miss Carlton said that it is impossible to count how many children have actually been adopted as a result of her column because many families have gotten in touch with agencies in response to the column but have ended up adopting a different child from the one featured. The column runs every Sunday in the Accents section of The Detroit News. William Giles, editor of The News, said that a recent survey showed that 42 percent of the respondents said they “usually” read the column and 43 percent more said they read the column at one time or another, making it one of the best‐read features in the paper. “It's not handled in a tear‐jerking way; it's handled straight, as a realistic look at what problems children have,” Mr. Giles said. “It's something a newspaper can do that's useful. It's also a human thing that stretches across all ages. I think it's good for the paper.” The Rochester Times‐Union The Kulps: From left, Lori, David, Suzanne, Carol, Matthew, Norman and Danny."
Priests in Portugal Helping Rightist Alliance,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/30/archives/priests-in-portugal-helping-rightist-alliance-political-role.html,"FATIMA, Portugal, Nov. 29 — An eminent Socialist calls it, half‐jokingly, “the biggest political party in Portugal.” The Roman Catholic Church is not running in Sunday's parliamentary election, but for the first time since the 1974 revolution priests and even some bishops are actively lobbying against both the Communist and Socialist Parties and in favor of a right‐wing electoral alliance. The church's campaign style is far removed from the brightly colored posters, banners, noisy meetings and sound trucks that are found all across the country. Not a single piece of party propaganda is visible in this austere village, which has become a beacon for millions of Catholic pilgrims since 1917 when three young shepherds had visions of the Virgin Mary on its barren tableland. But along the twisting roads that pilgrims follow to Fatima, a quiet political message is being put across. “The Portuguese people must decide whether they want a Marxist society, with all that implies for Christian values, or a more humane society with the conservation of the church's values,” a young priest explains patiently in the 17th‐century sacristy of a towering church in Santarem, “It is one bloc against another.” Political Role Opposed A visitor asks the priest about the Socialist Party, which in 1975 was allied with the church in beating back a Communist attempt to take power. “The Socialist Party,” counters the priest, “is a Marxist party and, have no doubt, they are being dishonest in exploiting justified aspirations for social justice.” He adds ominously that the Socialists plan to add atheism to school curriculums if they win. This kind of partisan counsel is a virtual endorsement of the right‐wing Democratic Alliance, which aims at winning an outright parliamentary majority Sunday. It is also against the public position of Portugal's Episcopal Conference, which has said that the church should “not move in the terrain of party politics.” But even some bishops have not felt bound by the Episcopal Conference. Pamphlets distributed by the Democratic Alliance cite the Archbishop of Viana do Castelo as having said that it is “illicit” for Catholics to vote for “certain political parties.” In Lisbon, politicians take this newfound activism of the church extremely seriously, and Mario Soares, the embattled Socialist leader, has paid conspicuous visits to church leaders to be assured of their neutrality. In an election that many expect to be very close, the engagement of hundreds of village priests could provide a decisive margin, especially in the conservative north. The zeal of the clergy in the north has been redoubled because of the perception that the Communist Party is making inroads for the first time. One piece of Communist propaganda states that Jesus would vote Communist were he alive today. “They've been in this game for 2,000 years,” said a well‐placed military officer, wryly noting how the church backed Mr. Soares when he was defending its interests, but now, in a changed climate, has shifted to the Democratic Alliance. “They know how to do these things.” Appointment Splits Hierarchy One reason for the church's return to the political scene was the appointment in July of a lay Catholic militant, Maria de Lurdes Pintassilgo, as caretaker Prime Minister to oversee the elections. A liberal on many questions — she has spoken in favor of abortion — Miss Pintassilgo split the church hierarchy, particularly after both the Communists and Socialists gave her unspoken backing in her nonparty role. Her vision of Catholicism is not widely shared by the conservative Portuguese priesthood, which has been little touched by the left‐wing brands of theology that have had great impact in Spain and Latin America. The true reach of the church will only be gauged after the votes are in, and even around sacred Fatima, in rough fields and pastel‐colored farmhouses, the clergy's voice is not always heeded. “Let the priests sing all they want,” said a jolly rough‐hewn man, halting his tractor to talk politics. “Nobody listens to them.” But strains of clericalism run as strong as those of anticlericalism in Portugal, and one Democratic Alliance candidate from the north confessed that he goes up to his constituency from Lisbon only on weekends. “During the week,” he said, “the priests do the rest.”"
Notes on People,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/30/archives/notes-on-people-mrs-abzug-sparks-furor.html,"She may be out of political office, but Bella S. Abzug hasn't lost her touch for stirring up controversy, even unwittingly, as seems to have been the case when she spoke earlier this week at the College of St. Benedict, a Roman Catholic school for women in St. Joseph, Mo. Mrs. Abzug Sparks Furor The former Democratic Representative from New York had no sooner left the campus than two antiabortion groups began urging a financial boycott of St. Benedict. “We feel that having Bella Abzug speak at a Catholic college is like having the Pope sit down with the devil for a dialogue,” said Paul Brown, director of one of the antiabortion groups, the Life Amendment Political Action Committee. A spokesman for the college, Martin McGowan, said: “She was here to speak about women and politics, and that's what she talked about for two hours. About all she said about abortion was that there was a difference about it and that people should respect one another's views.” Mrs. Abzug, who returned to New York yesterday, said: “Abortion is a woman's right to choose, and this threatened financial boycott indicates that some antichoice people are also against the right of free speech.” The New York Times Bella S. Abzug Stalking the Perfect Thud, or the Trouble With Plastic The Age of Plastic is making life difficult these days for Richard Fitz, a percussionist engaged by the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center for performances tonight and Sunday of Lukas Foss's “Echoi.” Mr. Fitz's problem is that he needs a large metal garbage can lid that, when bashed with a felt‐covered mallet, will produce the “dull, pitchless, illegitimate sound” specified by Mr. Foss for the final measure of “Echoi.” To find one, Mr. Fitz has been busily prowling through alleyways on the Upper West Side this week. What's made his search difficult is the fact that most garbage cans are made of plastic these days. The Foss work, which the composer calls “not‐yet music on the way” and “an aperiodic assortment of amusical sounds,” will keep Mr. Fitz busy. In addition to the garbage can cover (if he finds one), he'll be required to play bongo drums, cymbals and finger cymbals, woodwind and glass wind chimes, sand blocks, wood blocks, gongs and tom‐toms, in addition to his usual instruments. None of them are made of plastic, either. Timeless Artistry The relentless advance of age is something Jose de Creeft, the sculptor, and Raphael Soyer, the painter, seem to be ignoring. On Tuesday night, Mr. de Creeft, the Spanish‐born sculptor, celebrated his 95th birthday by opening a new show of his work at Kennedy Galleries. Best known to many New Yorkers as the sculptor of the Alice in Wonderland statue in Central Park, Mr. de Creeft is still doing formidable things with stone and wood. As for Mr. Soyer, he's also seemingly unaware of age and he too continues working. These days, he has Mr. de Creeft sitting for a portrait. Mr. Soyer turns 80 on Christmas Day, and to mark that milestone, a special exhibition of 24 of the artist's paintings, drawn from its own collection, will be presented at Washington's Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, starting next Tuesday. Tap Dancing at 70 Twice this week, Larry Adler, the harmonica virtuoso, performing in the King Cole Room of the St. Regis-Sheraton Hotel, has had someone very special to him in the audience — Paul Draper, who helped make tap dancing an art and toured with Mr. Adler for more than a decade. Now 70 years old, Mr. Draper, who taught at Carnegie‐Mellon Institute for 11 years, until 1978, is in town to work with the American Dance Machine. He is experimenting, he said yesterday, “at making a tap dance routine for a group that would have the same style I had when I danced alone.” Is it possible he might team up again with Mr. Adler after all these years? “It's unlikely,” he said with a laugh. “I'm no longer able to lift my behind as high as I used to. I wouldn't want to try to milk a good thing, try to fake what I did once. I still dance a lot, and I'm in excellent shape for an old man. But I wouldn't want to do a 40‐minute turn.” ‘Moral’ Conflict? Caning it a possible “moral” Conr?? of interest, some left‐wing members of Israel's Knesset yesterday asked Attorney General Yitzhak Zamir whether Israeli law will permit Philip M. Klutz- nick, a Chicago real estate developer and prominent American Jewish leader, to retain his substantial business interests in Israel if his designation as President Carter's Secretary of Commerce is approved. A highly placed official in the Attorney General's office in Jerusalem said the question was curious. But he promised there would be a check. Miss Reinking Is Injured Ann Reinking, star of the Broadway show “Dancin',” is sadly and suddenly in something of an awkward position. A day before she was to accept an award from the Footwear Council (“for people who have done fabulous feats with their feet”), someone accidentally bumped into her as she was heading onstage for Tuesday's second act. The result was a deep gash in her knee. She finished the performance, but the injury has put her out of action for what William Schelble, the show's agent, said they hoped would be “not more than a week.” Pastoral Severance Pay The congregation of Washington's First Baptist Church, which President Carter attends, has voted to stand firm in its decision to dismiss its pastor, the Rev. Charles A. Trentham. But the minister, ousted because he dated a divorced member of the church, won't have to go off penniless. This week, while reaffirming the decision to dismiss the minister, the congregation also voted to give him a $30,000 “pre‐retirement sabbatical,” plus $3,000 severance pay. The 60-yearold Dr. Trentham had been minister of the church for six years. Judith Cummings Albin Krebs"
"In France, a Better Break For Large Families An Increase in Maternity Leave",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/01/archives/in-france-a-better-break-for-large-families-an-increase-in.html,"PARIS, Nov. 30 — Two businessmen dash into the Gare St. Lazare here to catch their train to the suburbs, pausing only to buy their monthly tickets. Both men live in the same town but one pays only half as much. Why? Because he has more children. In this case, four as opposed to two for his friend. He need only show his card saying “Famille Nombreuse” — large family — to get big discounts on trains, buses, and subways throughout France. And he doesn't have to have the children with him. French population has been declining since World War I and, supported by the church, the Government traditionally has looked with favor on large families. Two weeks ago, the Government of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing announced a new series of measures to encourage having more children and to ameliorate the problems of those who have them already. The proposals were immediately characterized as “politically inspired” and as a “joke” by opponents within the Government and without. According to the Government, three children now make up a large family in France. Monique Pelletier, Minister of Women's Affairs, announced several measures aimed at aiding large families. Existing family allotments, either direct or through tax relief, would be increased at a rate of 3 percent a year — to offset inflation — for families with three or more children, more than double that granted to families with fewer than three children. The Government grant for the birth of a third and each succeeding child would rise to $2,500 —10,000 francs—from less than half that now, and it will apply to families at all economic levels. Actually, the new figure brings together various postnatal allocations that heretofore have been spread over two years. Maternity leave for working mothers for the third and succeeding children would be increased to six months from four, and all mothers of three or more children will be eligible for Government pensions covering the years spent raising their families. Finally, families who have a third child would be eligible to move to larger quarters in Government‐supported housing during the first six months after the child's birth. If they choose to buy or build a house, they could apply for a grant of up to 100 percent of the down payment. The cut‐rate fares would be extended to include all the members of a family of three or more as long as the youngest child is not yet 18 years old, and a form of Government insurance would be set up for widows who are mothers of families to help them for at least three years after the deaths of their husbands. The Government proposals made in the National Assembly were not greeted with unanimous enthusiasm. One delegate said earlier this week: “This is nothing but a cynical attempt to appease the antiabortion forces in Government on the eve of the upcoming abortion debate.” Today, the National Assembly made the abortion law permanent by a vote of 271 to 201. Still others here saw the new family proposals as little more than politics as usual. They pointed out that none of the proposals would become law before late next year or 1981, which just happens to be a Presidential election year in France. Still others denounced the measures as ineffectual. Noting that families have lost 50 percent of their purchasing power in the last 10 years, one Communist delegate said to Mrs. Pelletier: “You have already stolen the money that belongs to these families.” Mrs. Pelletier could only propose the changes in family support, but she was able to put through two measures by decree, one of which is sure to arouse controversy in most French cities. The first makes Government nursemaids free to any families who use them. The second measure involves the meticulously manicured parks of which the French are so proud and in which walking on the grass is rigorously prohibited. Henceforth, Mrs. Pelletier said, children will be able to play on the grass in all public parks, gardens and squares. No maximum age for playing on the grass was set."
French Abortion Law Made Final,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/01/archives/french-abortion-law-made-final.html,"PARIS, Nov. 30 — The abortion law passed provisionally five years ago was made permanent today by the French National Assembly. In spite of efforts on one side to liberalize the measure and on the other to rescind it, it was approved by a vote of 271 to 201. As in 1979, the Government of President Valery Giscard d'Estaing was able to win the vote only with the help of its political opponents, the Socialists and Communists. The Government, represented in the three‐day debate by Monique Pelletier, Minister of Women's Affairs, argued that the existing law, called the Weil Law for Simone Weil, Minister of Health in 1974, who introduced it, was more than adequate if enforced. Women's groups insisted that it was a law with no teeth and that many women — as many as 300,000 a year‐had illegal abortions while many thousands more went out of the country. Some amendments were added, among them an extension to a week for “the time of reflection,” now two days, during which a woman is supposed to consider the consequences. Physicians who refuse to perform abortions are required to provide women seeking them with lists of clinics where they are available. Unmarried minors must consent to abortion independently of their parents; heretofore, parents were able to force abortions on minor daughters."
The Modern Family: A Deluge of Fears And Complaints Secretary Expresses Hope,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/01/archives/the-modern-family-a-deluge-of-fears-and-complaints-secretary.html,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 30 — The American family was pictured as an endangered species by hundreds of citizens who voiced concern here today about issues ranging from inflation to the rising influence of cults. The complaints and fears poured out on the first day of a two‐day hearing held to obtain information for use at White House Conferences on Families to be held next summer in Baltimore, Minneapolis and Los Angeles. To the Rev. Robert L. Pruitt of Washington, unemployment is the most serious problem facing millions of Americans and their families, particularly blacks. “The crisis in America,” he said, “is not Iran or oil but jobs.” To Lee Bullitt, a spokesman for Planned Parenthood, teen‐age pregnancies and the lack of sex education are a threat to family stability. In the District of Columbia last year, she said, 92 percent of all births to teenagers were out of wedlock. David and Angela Boyter told why they have been divorced and remarried three times. Working couples, they explained, pay a higher income tax then two single persons earning the same total salaries. “It seems inconsistent for the Government to express concern for the family while at the same time imposing a marriage tax,” Mr. Boyter said. The Internal Revenue Service recently took the Boyters, of Ellicott City, Md., to Federal Tax Court for $3,100 in hack taxes it contends they owe. Other witnesses, testifying in various Senate and House committee rooms, touched on such issues as child abuse and neglect, abortion, gambling abuse, support of elderly parents, lack of child care facilities for working mothers, battered wives, domestic violence, poverty and the impact of pornography on the family. Still others said that family stability was threatened by violence within the home, by a lack of adequate housing, by the rising cost of essential services and by the disruptive influence of various cults on young people and their parents. While conceding that the challenge to family life was serious, Patricia Harris, the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, said in a speech opening the hearing that she was sure the family would survive. “I suspect concern over the possible disintegration of the family has been present in every society throughout the history of civilization,” she said. “I am sure that Adam and Eve .first questioned the future of the fimily when Cain slew Abel.” Mrs. Harris said that every department and agency of the Federal Government was following President Carter's directive to assess the positive and negative impacts of various Federal programs on families. She said that a recent study at George Washington University identified 331 domestic assistance programs that affect the family in one way or another. While problems still remain, she said, “the Carter years have been good years for the concerns of families.” The White House Conference on Families originally was to have been held this year. But plans languished after a series of personnel problems, including Roman Catholic protests over the naming of Patsy Fleming, the divorced mother of three teen‐agers, as executive director. Mrs. Fleming subsequently resigned and President Carter revived the conference this year, naming Jim Guy Tucker of Arkansas, a former Democratic member of the House of Representatives, as chairman. Among those on the advisory committee are Lieut. Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York and Coretta Scott King, the widow of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr."
TV VIEW; Unhappiness Within the Industry,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/02/archives/tv-view-unhappiness-within-the-industry.html,"Unhappiness Within the Industry Breakfait interviews are tricky affairs. With bleary eyes hovering over islands of chilled grapefruit’ halves, lukewarm coffee and cold toast, the conversation can begin to ramble somewhat distressingly. On the other hand, the early hour, between 8 and10, is oddly conducive to candor. The participants haven't had an opportunity to assume their more formal, more professional lunch‐time poses. Perhaps the truths gleaned in assorted “nights before” linger on. Purely by coincidence, two such morning contacts provide striking contrast between American and British attitudes toward TV production. The subject of the first meeting was the British Broadcasting Corporation. Passing through town on their way to a BBC/Time‐Life retrospective in Washington, D.C., were Shaun Sutton, head of the BBC‐TV Group, and Christopher Railing, newly installed as chief of documentaries. A week later, in another hotel dining room, the subject was commercial television in this country as Susan Harris, creator and writer of ABC's “Soap” series, offered her outspoken opinions on the troubling domestic state of the art. • • • This is not the best of times for the BBC. British governments, whether Labor or Conservative, are not keen on the idea of raising the license fees that are levied yearly on television sets. Collected by the Post Office, which serves as a buffer between government and broadcaster, these fees constitute the vast bulk of BBC revenues. Hit by continuing inflation, the BBC is thus suffering. At the same time, the commerical‐television outlets in Britain are doing very well financially. Consequently, the BBC is losing top administrative and production personnel to the commercial ranks, which can afford to pay considerably higher salaries. As Mr. Sutton explains, a director on a major BBC production might earn, at the most, the equivalent of $700 a week. Over on ITV, the commercial side, the same director could command between $1,400 and $1,600 a week. Of course, the BBC holds a trump card in that it can offer the serious producer, director or actor an opportunity to do some serious work in drama or various serial projects. But Mr. Sutton points out that the commercial chaps are increasingly making forays into similar serious projects, thereby narrowing the gap between themselves and the BBC. More to the immediate point, though, is the optimistic outlook of the Messrs. Sutton and Railing. While conceding the prospects for future gloom, they still exude an air of confidence — in themselves, in their work and in television. They are television programmers, not lawyers or salesmen. Mr. Railing has been in the current affairs and the documentary departments of the BBC since 1962. His past programs have included “The Search for the Nile,” “The Fight Against Slavery” and, coming soon on public television, “The Voyage of Charles Darwin.” As the new head of documentaries, he ethos his American counterparts by noting that “resources are thin at the moment, and I've actually got more producers than I can use.” He cannot readily remember any major BBC documentary he has made recently, and he has not formulated specific plans for the future, but he is determined to restore the form to “a sense of an event.” Too many documentaries, he says, have taken “a rather run‐of‐the‐mill turn.” Mr. Sutton arrived at the BBC in 1952 as a director of children's drama, writing almost everything he directed. He went on to direct several popular series and, in 1967, became head of serial drama, responsible for such productions as “The Forsyte Saga,” “Vanity Fair,” “Roads to Freedom” and “The First Churchills.” Mr. Sutton had extensive experience in the theater as stage manager and director. He stresses that in television after World War H, “we all of us directors, writers, actors‐came from the theater, not from the film world or the universities or radio.” In the BBC drama department, assistants are still required to do a twoyear apprenticeship in the theater. “I think that's what it is all about,” Mr. Sutton says, referring to the famed BBC ability to recruit the best of theatrical talents in Britain. Meanwhile, Mr. Sutton talks enthusiastically about continuing the Shakespeare plays, now under the direction of Jonathan Miller, creating a successor to “I, Claudius” in a series about the Borgias, and preparing a series based on the life of Nancy Astor. He is constantly preoccupied_ with details. He wonders aloud if studio sets can't be just as effective as on‐location shooting. “The problem with doing ‘As You Like It’ in the woods,” he declares with a smile, “is that it becomes a play about trees.” Like Mr. Railing, Mr. Sutton operates with the conviction that television can be a vehicle for content of substance. • • • Susan Harris would disagree vehemently. Here is one of the more successful figures in the world's most financially successful system, and she expresses little more than contempt for television. Still in her 30's, Miss Harris is softspoken, intense, attractive and obviously strong‐willed. She began writing for television after watching a program one evening and deciding that she could do better. Her first script was a “Then Came Bronson” episode. She worked for Norman Lear, contributing among other things the controversial script for Maude's abortion. When NBC abruptly canceled her “Fay” series, starring Lee Grant, Miss Harris's explosion of unprintable expletives in one of the network's executive suites became an instant industry legend. In partnership with Tony Thomas, son of Danny, and Paul Witt, she approached ABC with “Soap,” which generated a storm of emotional publicity about its more outrageous elements. The network received 22,000 protest letters even before the first episode was televised. Miss Harris kept insisting that “we're not out there to shock people — the idea is simple entertainment and laughter.” “Soap” has survived, the Republic remains reasonably intact and Miss Harris has even reaped a profitable spinoff in the new “Benson,” giving the character of the outspoken black butler his own series. Miss Harris has become a power in Televisionland; yet, she is far from feeling in any way fulfilled. She confesses that she doesn't like television; the only programs she watches are “60 Minutes” and “The Muppet Show.” As “Soap” slides through its third season, Miss Harris is having difficulty keeping sight of the goals of simple entertainment and laughter. Although she now has some help in writing the scripts, she is bored with the overall chore. The idea of introducing extraterrestrial beings into this season's shows seemed hilarious at the story conferences, she says, but didn't work too well in performance. It . has now reached a point, she says, that when a scene turns out especially well in script form, she is reluctant to “waste it” on “Soap.” Miss Harris looks forward to developing several other writers who could run the series without her active participation. At first, this may sound like another case of poor‐littlerich‐girl crying all the way to the bank. But, quietly insistent, Miss Harris seems sincere about wanting to leave the “greedy, money‐hungry” world of television and try writing for the stage. “How much money can one person possibly use?” she asks, while admitting that it is nice to have enough to travel occasionally to Africa or Israel with her 12year‐old son. Miss Harris is grateful to television in general and to ABC in particular for what she has been able to accomplish, but she is unable to see television figuring large in her future. It would be foolish, obviously, to draw any definitive conclusions from these two conversations. Unhappiness in various guises can undoubtedly ne discovered in the corridors of the BBC. But even the most casual observer has to be struck by the degree of dissatisfaction that permeates the topmost echelons of American television. Garry Marshall, producer of “Happy Days” and “Laverne and Shirley,” also talks about retreating to the stage. Norman Lear, moving back to feature films, doesn't even watch his own company's television pilots. Last week, on a program called “All About TV,” Paul Klein, former NBC programming chief, revealed that his formula for a successful television program is “phony realism” overlaid with “trash,” which creates the illusion that the program is meaningful. The cynicism, the sense of bitterness, is almost painful. More significantly, the future of a system fostering such feelings must be left open to serious question."
Mexican Feminists Turn Their Attention to Social Issues; Many Marriages Breaking Up,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/02/archives/mexican-feminists-turn-their-attention-to-social-issues-many.html,"MEXICO CITY, Dec. 1 — In the early 1970's Mexican feminists rushed to imitate the women's liberation movement in the United States.. They studied Susan Sontag and Betty Friedan, they organized protests at beauty contests and they declared war on male domination. For a while Mexico's legendary machos were nervously amused. The “girls” were a topic of conversation and the butt of jokes. The Government even sought to appease them by eliminating sex discrimination from the statute books. But as the movement lost some of its militancy in the United States, the feminist “threat” seemed to fade. Now Mexican feminists have reappeared. This time, they have shifted the focus of their campaign from sexual equality to social equality, from the concerns of middle‐class Americans to the plight of poor Mexican women. As a result the feminists, many of them university graduates from wealthy families, have begun working closely with leftist opposition parties. Earlier this month they presented Congress with a bill calling for the legalization of abortion. Seeking to assist poor women more directly, they have also opened a clinic for rape victims. “Here feminism is closer to the left and to the workers than in the United States,” said Marta Acevedo, a leader of the movement. Its struggle to establish both its own identity and a coherent strategy has been traumatic. On a personal level, many marriages broke up and feminists found themselves “misunderstood” by families and friends. The movement also divided into at least 10 often‐squabbling groups, ranging from those who saw sexual oppression of women as an isolated problem to those fighting for a broader social revolution. The feminists recognized the limited possibilities of their movement among middle‐class women, who invariably have servants to look after homes and children and therefore experience few of the domestic conflicts of division of labor of, say, American women. Leftist women, on the other hand, say they began to notice that their husbands or roommates wanted equality in society but not in the home. “We began to move to the left and the others abandoned their Marxist slogans,” said Anilu Elias, founder of the moderate National Women's Movement. “The new motto is feminism in the social struggle, socialism in the feminist struggle.” Feminism Widely Accepted The balance of the past decade, though, has not been entirely negative. “The feminist movement has not grown, yet the concept of feminism has slowly been accepted by all classes,” Miss Acevedo said. “Men don't like being called macho any more. They used to be proud of it, but now they're embarrassed. Even radio soap operas no longer have the stereotyped woman crying over an unfaithful man. They have working women who play a more active role in society.” Reflecting American influence, women's magazines have begun squeezing in feminist articles between fashion layouts and love stories. Two years ago a group of women intellectuals started publishing a quarterly called Fern that is printing 16,000 copies distributed free to subscribers of a leftist daily newspaper, Uno Mas Uno. Earlier this year most feminist groups joined forces in a new National Front for the Liberation and Rights of Women, which has taken the lead in the fight to legalize abortion. Society as a whole, though, remains dominated by men. There are no women in the Cabinet and only one of the 31 state governors, Griselda Alvarez of Campeche, is a woman. Women did not even receive the vote until 1953. All key opposition and labor leaders are men, even• in cases where most of a union's members are women. In business few women hold executive positions. Women make up only 20 percent of university students and 25 percent of the work force. A Government family‐planning program was instituted in 1974 as a response to population pressure rather than acknowledgment of a woman's right to limit the size of her family. Every year, it is estimated, 1.2 million illegal abortions take place; 40,000 women die as a result of complications, according to an official study. Sexual Revolution Among Youths Among middle‐class youths, the easy availability of birth‐control devices has brought something of a sexual revolution in the past decade. But the attitude of poor women toward sex is reflected in their language: intercourse is when they are “used” by their partners and pregnancy is when they are “ill” and childbirth is when they “get better.” Many men regard a pregnant wife as proof of their virility, and sociologists say that wife‐beating is widespread. Feminists, accustomed to theoretical discussions in the comfort of their homes, say they were overwhelmed when they confronted the condition of poor women. “We had an active group of middleclass students,” said Silvia Hernandez, who as a young member of Congress raised the abortion issue publicly five years ago, “but as soon as we proposed working in the slums, half the group left.” Miss Hernandez, who is now in charge of the Government's youth programs, recalled her first venture among the poor. “We decided to study the cost of living in a slum,” she said. “It seemed like a good way to start. But the next thing we knew, the local women wanted to seize the corner store that had been overcharging them. We weren't quite ready for that.” Marta Lamas, an anthropologist, encountered the same cultural gap when she tried to discuss feminism with the poor. “They didn't know what we were talking about,” she said. “They were concerned about food prices or a sick child or the lack of water. Now we don't come with the feminist message but try to address the real problems of the women.” Specific Issues Tackled The growing emphasis of the feminist movement on social problems reflects its recognition that most problems of poor women cannot be solved on their own. “It's important to talk about women, but it's more important to talk about people,” Miss Heriguidez said. “The situation of many men is so pitiful that it's almost irrelevant to talk about the differences between men and women.” As the activists, who still number only about 300, have moved away from theory, they have lowered their sights from dramatically transforming society to advancing on specific issues, such as abortion, rape and education. “Feminism is still weak,” Miss Lamas conceded, “but tell me what political movement in Mexico is not weak. There is no democratic environment, there is great political apathy, the lack of political organization is not exclusive to women. Our view it that the enemy is not men but the system.” The New York Times/Alan Riding Marta Acevedo, right, a founder of Mexican feminist movement, with a fellow demonstrator at the Chamber of Deputies earlier this month in Mexico City."
"A Second Time, France Passes A Law Making Abortion Legal",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/02/archives/a-second-time-france-passes-a-law-making-abortion-legal.html,"PARIS — One side of the rue de i'Universite was lined with the blue buses of the tough riot police. Across the way, under the walls of the National Assembly, small groups of people, mostly women and mostly middle‐aged, huddled fingering rosaries and whispering prayers. Inside, after four days of debate, the Assembly voted 271 to 201 last week for a new, permanent French law permitting abortions in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy. Senate approval is expected. Interest was intent in this predominantly Catholic country, but there was no apparent need for the jack‐booted police. Despite street demonstrations and exhortations by church and political leaders, partisan scuffles were few, and the debate was surprisingly mild. In part, it was because this was France's second time around. In 1974, spurred on by Socialist and Communist support, which again proved crucial this year, the Assembly passed an abortion law — to last five years. Last week, leftists supplied 200 “yes” votes while most Gaullists and about half from President Valery Giscard d'Estaing's party opposed the law. The President had said it should be combined with measures to make adoption easier. “It is not a matter of choosing between life and death, but of dealing with real distress and offering [expectant] mothers a chance to have the child adopted if they don't feel able to take care of it,” he said. Conservatives, led by the Catholic Church, were opposed. “Every abortion is an act of death,” said Roger Cardinal Etchegaray, head of the French bishops conference and archbishop of Marseilles. But in a poll in Le Figaro, a leading conservative Paris newspaper, one‐third of all practicing Catholics approved permitting abortion. The left, including Communists and Socialists, wanted the law liberalized. The quality of enforcement was their main complaint. “If the existing law, whatever its imperfections, was really enforced, it would be more than sufficient,” agreed Monique Pelletier, Minister for Women's Affairs. Some 200,000 illegal abortions a year still are performed in France, plus an unknown number on French women abroad, particularly in The Netherlands. The new law increases fines and prison sentences for performing illegal operations. Many French doctors refuse to perform abortions; now they will be required to provide patients with a list of abortion centers. The 1974 law gave reluctant physicians several convenient outs. Doctors or other medical professionals can refuse if they object to abortion on grounds of conscience. A oneweek “delay for reflection” requires every woman seeking an abortion to consult a family counselor, a family planning center or other qualified social agency. A certificate affirming the consultation must be produced before the abortion can be performed. In Le Figaro's recent poll, 64 percent favored authorizing abortions. Among professional people, businessmen and educators, the percentage went up to 76 percent. Support was weaker among women under 40 (for whom abortion was a personal option). In an unwanted pregnancy, they were asked, would they have recourse to abortion? “Yes, certainly,” said 33 percent; “yes, probably,” said 18 percent, for a total of 51 percent. The apparently overwhelming public consensus had obvious effects on the National Assembly. After demonstrations all over France, including a pro‐abortion march by 20,000 men and women last weekend in Paris (antiabortion advocates held an equally large and peaceful march the week before), the debate was anticlimactic. At one point, Mrs. Pelletier, who had been prepared to battle with fiery advocates from both the right and left, was prompted to ask critics of the old bill: “Well, what do you propose in its place?” The best immediate answer was a vague request for political action “on behalf of the family.” While thousands march for or against it, abortion still is a politically touchy subject. French political figures usually preface a statement on abortion, particularly if they are going to vote for it, by saying: “well, of course, I am a natalist. . . . “The French birthrate has dropped steadily for more than a century, rapidly since 1964, so “natalism” — increasing the birthrate — is easy to support, even though it may ocasionally carry racist overtones. There are those who talk only about whites when they urge more births. In what was generally viewed as an attempt to mollify the natalists and the more conventional antiabortionists, the Government has announced increased benefits for larger families, particularly those with two children and which are expecting more. Outright cash grants will go from about $600 to $2,500, access to better housing was made easier, transportation subsidies were increased and the Government agreed to pay for child care for working mothers. Time off for pregnancy was boosted from four months to six for working mothers, and mothers of at least three children were promised that pensions would now be calculated to credit time they spend raising their families. Not coincidentally, most of these measures, while announced on the eve of the abortion debate, cannot be enacted into law until sometime next year, as the warmup for the 1981 presidential election is beginning.

Useful Skepticism; Author's Query,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/02/archives/useful-skepticism-authors-query.html,"THE CLAL I OF REASON Wittgensteir. Skepticism, Morality, an Tragedy. By Stanley C vell. 511 pp. New ork: Oxford Univ. rsity Press. $19.95. “After we came out of the church, we stood talking for some time together of Bishop Berkeley's ingenious sophistry to prove the non‐existence of matter, and that everything in the universe is merely ideal. I observed that though we are satisfied his doctrine is not true, it is impossible to refute it. never shall forget the alacrity with which Johnson answered, striking his foot with mighty force against a large stone, till he rebounded from it, ‘I refute it thus.’ “ — from Boswell's “The Life of Samuel Johnson” This is the most disappointing anecdote I know about Johnson, for it bespeaks an unwillingness even to face the problem or skepticism. Even as I recoil from the rock, overcome with pain, my right foot black and blue, it is possible that I am just dreaming or that I am a brain in a vat, being fed a computer program of experiences. Of course, during those moments in which I am contorted with pain or experiencing any of the violent emotions of everyday life, my response to the skeptic's challenge that I am dreaming will be, “Who cares?” “Skepticism and solutions to skepticism,” says Stanley Cavell, “make their way in the world mostly as lessons in hypocrisy: providing solutions one does not believe to problems one has not felt.” Mr. Cavell, who is Walter M. Cabot Professor of Aesthetics and the General Theory of Value at Harvard and the author of “The World Viewed” and other books, would like to provide a solution we do believe to problems we have felt. Skepticism, he thinks, can help us clarify our perceptions of personal and moral experience; and enable us to form a more mature view of the world. Skepticism forces us to confront a fundamental aspect of human experience: our sense of Jonathan Lear teaches philosophy at Cambridge University. separation from the world and from others. Only a few people, whom most of the rest of us are content to call “schizophrenic,” are genuinely afraid that the external world does not exist. But most of us spend quite a lot of time wondering whether what our acquaintances, friends and lovers tell us is an accurate expression of their feelings. How can we move from the outward behavior of our lover to his or her inner life? Is there any human relation so intimate that all parties can completely eliminate the possibility that they will be surprised, disappointed or hurt by another? Mr. Cavell does not claim to take the surprise out of life, but he does claim to give a better account of what we are being surprised by. Following the Viennese philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, Mr. Cavell rejects the skeptic's division between inner and outer, the dichotomy of soul and body. For Wittgenstein, it makes perfect sense to say, “looking at him, I can see his soul.” To assume that beyond another's professions of affection and his outward behavior there remains something forever hidden to us, namely his feelings, is to grant too much to the skeptic. This is not to say, as is often mistakenly supposed, that Wittgenstein is a crude behaviorist, rejecting hidden feelings in favor of outward manifestations. What he rejects is not the feelings but the skeptic's claim that the feelings remain hidden behind overt behavior. Thus, for Mr. Cavell as for Wittgenstein, our surprise at another's actions is not due to a failure to guess which feelings lay behind the behavior but to an inability to see what the behavior was. It is this failure to perceive ourselves and our world accurately that, for Mr. Cavell, is the source of tragedy. Since Freud it has been a commonplace that we can be estranged from ourselves and fail to recognize the situation we are in. But according to Mr. Cavell, it was Shakespeare, among modern writers, who first and most subtly elaborated the tragic consequences of such ignorance. Lear would not recognize Cordelia's silence for what it was; Othello refused to recognize Desdemona's sincerity: It is the skeptic, according to Mr. Cavell, who makes us aware of our separation, our ignorance, and who also sets a limit on the information we should expect the world to; provide. What more did Lear expect from Cordelia, Othello from Desdemona? The skeptic prepares us for the realization that the very human relations in which we are involved may be what Mr. Cavell calls “the best case” of relations with another; to look for more is to misperceive one's present situation. In the moral realm, the skeptic challenges us to explain how we can move from a way the world is to what we ought to do about it. The skeptic's world is morally inert; it never dictates my obligations. Mr. Cavell, following a tradition that goes back at least to Aristotle, rejects the skeptic's dichotomy between is and ought. He argues that moral debate is often over the correct description of an action — for example, whether or not abortion is murder. What ought to be done flows directly from the description. Thus moral knowledge is a form of self‐knowledge; it forms part of our ability to recognize ourselves and the world we inhabit. The main ptoblem with this book is one of style. Wittgenstein's own style is so overpowering that every interpreter risks a fate that. Wittgensteinhimself managed to avoid: writing prose so stylzed that it can only be appreciated by the writer himself or a few intimates. Mr. Cavell is deeply concerned with finding a philosophical voice. Unfortunately, this concern undermines him, for while much of the book is charming, there is much that is overwritten and self‐conscious. Yet perhaps stylistic difficulty is the inevitable cost of having taken on the remarkable task of, welcoming the poets back into the Republic and re‐establishing a dialogue between literature and philosophy. ■ For a biography of Elizabeth Packard (1816‐97), author and activist for the rights of married women and mental hospital inmates, I would appreciate any letters, diaries, hospital records and manuscripts, as well as in. formation on her heirs.

"Anderson, Presidential Prospect, Gets $5,000 From Abortion Unit",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/02/archives/anderson-presidential-prospect-gets-5000-from-abortion-unit.html,"WASHINGTON, Dec. 1—A Republican Presidential candidate, Representative John B. Anderson of Illinois, today accepted a $5,000 contribution from the National Abortion Rights Action League's political action committee. The gift marked the first involvement in Presidential politics by the group, which opposes limitations on abortions. Previous contributions went to Congressional candidates. Addressing about 50 members of the league who were here for a board of directors meeting, Mr. Anderson said, “This is one of the issues that ought to be discused.” Abortion, he said in an interview, should be a matter between a woman and her doctor. He added that he favored having Medicaid finance abortions for poor women who otherwise could not afford it. He told the league that he would continue to raise the abortion issue in his campaign. A spokesman for the league said that Mr. Anderson had been singled out for a contribution because he had been “actively speaking and out front on the abortion issue.”"
"The Nation; 13,000 Pink Slips From Big Steel Add Economic Gloom",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/02/archives/the-nation-13000-pink-slips-from-big-steel-add-economic-gloom.html,"Continued Jobs and the Government's stake in private enterprise combined with another 1 percent rise in the Consumer Price Index (for October) last week, to produce another grim seven days for the White House's economic unit. The nation's largest steel producer, the United States Steel Corporation, announced the closing of 15 outmoded plants and mills in eight states. That will cost 13,000 production and whitecollar jobs. David M. Roderick, U.S. Steel's chairman, called the plants “noncompetitive” and placed the blame squarely on Federal tax, import and environmental policies. But Peter Anker of the First Boston Corporation, echoed many other analysts when he asked “if they [steel management] had higher profit would they have put it in those outmoded facilities?” Representative Charles A. Vanik wasn't arguing the fine points. Warning of an ultimate loss of 50,000 jobs, the Ohio Democrat proposed a multibillion‐dollar loan guarantee program for industrywide modernization. A hint of how such a proposal might fare came in the Senate Banking Committee, where the Administration's bail‐out plan for the Chrysler Corporation was significantly modified. Arguing that those who stand to lose the most from a Chrysler failure should bear the greater part of the risk, Richard G. Lugar, a conservative Republican from Indiana, and Paul E. Tsongas, a liberal Democrat from Massachusetts, convinced their colleagues to vote out a $1.25 billion guarantee package ($250 million less than the White source: U. S. Department of commerce House had asked) — but only if the United Auto Workers agree to give up wage increases won earlier this fall, and only if $2.75 billion in legally binding commitments from private and local government sources are forthcoming. Bankers have said they won't extend more unsecured credit. A Tentative Test Of Abortion Law The United States Supreme Court last week re‐entered the dispute over Government‐financed abortions — but under circumstances that may not produce a definitive ruling. The Court agreed to hear arguments on an Illinois appeal involving the constitutionality of the Hyde Amendment, the four‐year‐old Congressional ban on Medicaid financing for most abortions. The case poses this question: Is it constitutional for the Government to refuse to pay for “medically necessary” abortions for poor women when it pays for virtually all other medically necessary procedures? While the words “medically necessary” distinguish this appeal from Maher v. Roe (in which the Court ruled two years ago that states have no obligation to pay for “elective” abortions), it is a less‐than‐ideal test. The original suit in Federal District Court in Chicago was brought on statutory, not constitutional, grounds. The judge ruled on the constitutional issue because a higher court had said it must be addressed. His finding that the Hyde Amendment was unconstitutional was then challenged by the Justice Department, the state of Illinois, and anti‐abortionists. Given this origin, it is not certain that the High Court will decide the broad question — or even, after bearing arguments next spring, that it will decide it has Jurisdiction. Some advocates on both sides would prefer that the Justices await a more clearcut case, expected to be decided soon in Federal District Court in Brooklyn. There, the amendment is challenged on the ground that Congress passed it to promote a religious viewpoint. Double Whammy For the F.T.C? Such is the state of siege between Congress and the beleagured Federal Trade Commission that when the House voted last week, 321 to 63, to give the legislators veto authority over some rulings of the regulators, it was far from the F.T.C's greatest worry. Worse, it fears, is ahead in the Senate, to which the agency's supporters had originally looked for protection. The House has approved a legislative veto three times before. The Senate never has, and one is not now before it. What is, is a Commerce Committee bill that would severely curtail current commission activities, including its proceedings on advertising in children's television and used car dealers. Similar amendments had been knocked out of the House bill. Not all, however. In the course of passing the F.T.C's spending authorization, the House also barred it from bringing antitrust actions against agricultural cooperatives and from cancelling trademarks it thinks have become generic. When the bill first hit the floor two weeks ago, the House voted that the commission shelve proposed funeral‐industry regulations. The House legislation would allow either house of Congress to adopt resolution of disapproval after a commission ruling, as for example in the funeral‐industry case, where the commission wanted to prohibit quotation of prices over the phone. If it is not overturned by the other chamber within 30 days, the veto would stand. History Turns, On Desegregation In 1951, 10‐year‐old Linda Brown of Topeka, Kan., was barred because of her race from attending an all‐white school five blocks from her home. Her father's anger led the United States Supreme Court, in 1954, to mandate desegregated and unified school districts “with all deliberate speed.” Today, Linda Brown is Linda Brown Smith; her children attended the same school she did, and when they entered, it was 98 percent black. Last week she and seven other parents heard United States District Court Judge Richard Rogers grant their petition that Brown v. Board of Education be reopened. The parents, who among them have 17 children in Topeka's elementary and high schools, argue that the 35school system is still in clear violation of the 1954 decision. As evidence, their petition cited school district data showing that while only 22 percent of the district's 17,480 students are members of minority groups, some elementary and junior high schools have a minority enrollment of 40 to 73 percent and others of 3 to 6 percent. School officials do not challenge the figures, but they deny that they are the product of deliberate efforts to maintain segregated schools. They point to a 1961 plan, which a lower court panel called a “good faith effort” toward desegregation. Eventually, eight of Topeka's most heavily segregated schools will shut. Iran Doesn't Count In Energy Debate Like a stalled hurricane, Congress generated high winds last week but moved forward very little on energy. Iran or no Iran, a de facto filibuster developed in the Senate over President Carter's “windfall” tax on oil profits. The House had trouble deciding how many members from each of two rival committees should be sent to confer with the Senate on creation of an Energy Mobilization Board. The Senate, in a similar dispute, still had not chosen its conferees on the syntheticfuels bill It passed several weeks ago. Congressional leaders admitted that the principal elements of an energy program once expected by Labor Day seemed unlikely to reach the White House until next year. The debate over the oil profits tax helps explain why. Nearly a half year ago, the House passed a bill designed to raise about $277 billion over ten years by taxing profits of oil companies freed from domestic price controls. The Senate Finance Committee eventually offered bill that would raise $138 billion. Most of last week's Senate battling was over plans to raise or lower that amount, with pro‐Administration forces seeking changes that would push the total to at least $185 billion, and opponents, including oil‐state Senators, threatening to kill the tax altogether if such pressure persisted. Negotiations continue this week, al, though Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd yesterday disclosed that a compromise may be close. A few perceptive Senators noted that increasingly the legislation looks more like a tax than an energy bill. It contains, for example, an amendment that would give taxpayers a new deduction ($200 for an individual, $400 for a married couple) for savings account interest and stock dividends."

Details of the potential exposure were being withheld until today so that the certified letters could be received first by the persons involved. Mr. Leon stressed that no complaint of any actual cancer had been received. Newark Still Seeking Aid Against Arson NEWARK (AP) — No one has taken home a share of a $50,000 reward fund created last February by the Newark City Council to help catch arsonists, to whom almost a third of the city's fires are attributed. Council President Earl Harrii said, “Although there is no way to put a cost on the value of life, the bounty fund was created in hopes that it might provide a cash incentive to persons who had previously been afraid to report suspicious fires.” The fund makes awards of up to $1,000 for information leading to arrests and convictions. Princeton's Policy On Abortion Fought PRINCETON, N.J. (UPI) — A organization at Princeton University called “Students for Conscientious Choice” is opposing the use of health fee to finance student abortions and hopes to meet this week with the college president, William Bowen, to discuss the issue. The organization has collected about 800 names on a petition demanding a rebate on that part of the $200 annual fee that covers pregnancy‐related medical expenses. University officials said about $5 of the tee was used to pay for abortions. The students say the mandatory health fee forces them to support a practice they find objectionable. But administrators have refused the demand for reimbursement, saying it would lead to similar requests from groups protesting other issues. University insurance pays for $135 of the cost of an abortion, which averages about $165. Officials said 35 undergraduate women received abortions during the last school year. Fire in 4 Conrail Cars Termed Arson Conrail reported that arson had caused the fires that broke out in four old cars of the New Haven and New York Central lines stored at a repair yard in Croton, N.Y., Saturday night.

"TV: ‘Friendships, Secrets and Lies’",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/03/archives/tv-friendships-secrets-and-lies.html,"HE gimmick mills are apparently inexhaustible. Tonight on NBCTV at 9 o'clock, “Friendships, Secrets and • Lies” is being billed as “the first television movie with an all‐female cast and creative staff.” But what some nervous males might subtitle “The Ultimate Revenge of Gloria Steinem” promises that “no.males are seen or heard in the milestone film.” Based on “The Walls Came Tumbling Down,” a novel by Babs H. Deal, the Joanna. Jane Crawford script is confined to one of the more awkward plots of recent years. As a college sorority house is being demolished, the skeleton of a baby is discovered in one of its shafts. With the help of modern detection techniques and a thoroughly obnoxious reporter for the local newspaper, it is established that the baby must have been aborted by one of the six women who spent a summer alone at the house 20 years earlier. As luck would have it, all six are still living in the same town. The discovery triggers vicious local gossip and a rash of emotional demonstrations for and against abortion. The six women are forced to band together, resuming the close relationships of their earlier days. Old resentments and jealousies are revived, threatening to destroy the group and some of its individual members. With this‐cumbersome ‐structure set up rather shakily, the women begin to emerge as distinctive Personalities. A few are divorced., One is'a widow. Another is a lesbian. The mix has been arranged with care. There is talk, of cotuser about abortion and contraceptives. As the woman recall their youthful innocence and enforced shame in sexual matters, today's generation cheerfully declares, “We are so lucky we have the pill.” There are also numerous passing references to growing old, to losing husbands to younger women. A mother warns her teen‐age daughter: “Don't you ever count on love … do your studies think like a man, work like a man.” The performances do manage to transcend this banality with surprising frequency. The six women are realized sharply and sympathetically by Cathryn Damon, Shelley Fabares, Paula Prentiss, Tina Louise, LorettaSwit and Stella Stevens. Sondra Locke has the thankless role of the overly ambitious journalist. And Fran Bennett manages to save the black maid Clarissa from mammy stereotyping. Directed by Ann Zane Shanks and Marlena Laird, the film is unable to avoid several ludicrous scenes. As distraught Tina Louise staggers about a beauty shop in what looks like Ophelia's mad scene, a friend asks sweetly, “Are you sure you're all right?” Miss Louise begins smashing everyone in sight with her outsized pocketbook and Stella Stevens stands by with a black eye from her wife‐beating husband, while Cathryn Damon clutches her head in disbelief. Mist Damon's plight is understandable. Males are indeed kept out of sight, but not without difficulty. One ‘wife waves out the window to her husband and sons as they depart on a trip. Another, the abused one, has to walk toward and beyond the camera, only to be thrown back bloodied by her unseen husband. The closing credits do list a few male names in categories such as set design and sound mixing. Presumably, they are not considered part of the “creative staff.” In the end, “Friendships” demonstrates the obvious: Given the right circumstances, women can be just as mediocre as men in their creative endeavors.

Teen‐Agers in Poll Back Traditional Home Values,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/05/archives/teenagers-in-poll-back-traditional-home-values.html,"A poll of top high school students indicates a swing back toward traditional values regarding home and marriage. Only 8 percent of those surveyed said they favored couples living together before marriage while 47 percent of those polled in 1971 said they favored cohabitation before marriage. By United Press International The survey was based on a sampling of 23,200 of the 355,000 juniors and seniors listed in “Who's Who Among American High School Students.” The results were announced Tuesday by Educational Communications Inc., publishers of the book. Other views on sex and marriage included the following: 76 percent said they had not had sexual relations and 86 percent said they would not have a child without being married. On abortion, 51 percent in the current survey said they were opposed to it while 69 percent said they favored it nine years ago. In a change from three years ago, the survey found that only 32 percent of the students felt that a woman should experience both career and marriage to be fulfilled, while 43 percent felt that this was so in the earlier survey. It was the 10th annual poll by the publishers of “Who's Who” of the young people who are recommended for listing by their high school principals or guidance counselors and national youth organizations. Criteria include leadership, achievement in academics, school activities, community service or athletics and recognition by the publishing company for high performance in national scholarship or award contests. The survey, taken during the summer, also recorded the students’ Presidential preferences. Of the potential Presidential candidates, the students favored them in the following order: Senator Edward M. Kennedy, 31.3 percent; former Gov. Ronald Reagan, 15.9 percent; former President Gerald R. Ford, 13.1 percent; President Carter, 9.9 percent and Gov. Edmund G. Brown 8.6 percent. Thirteen percent were undecided about a Presidential preference."

The episode, however, will turn the athlete into a spectator for the fifth annual United Negro College Fund/Arthur Ashe tennis benefit Sunday at Madison Square Garden, at which he was to head a celebrity lineup of players.

Columbia to Honor Tustice Douglas in Washington Not since 1861, when Abraham Lincoln received an honorary doctor of laws degree at the White House, has Columbia University conferred an honorary degree away from its campus. But William O. Douglas, law school class of 1925 and retired Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, is unable to come to Columbia, so Columbia is going to him. Twice in the past, frail health has prevented him from fulfilling the tradition of coming to the campus to accept the degree.

Kennedy that Mrs. Luce saved her most jagged barbs. “Teddy's refrain,” she said, “is, ‘Anything Jimmy can do, I can do better, I can do anything better than he’ ‐ of course he would say ‘him.'” “The women's movement,” which she favors, Mrs. Luce said, “ought to drop this thing they have about abortion and take up a really serious issue, like cosmetic surgery.

The prolific Broadway composer (“Bye Bye Birdie,” “Golden Boy”) is having a workweek that would break the back of a less hardy soul. Tuesday night, after weeks of rehearsal, Mr. Strouse opened a twoweek engagement as a performer at the King Cole Room of the St. RegisSheraton Hotel. The act, featuring Ann Anello and Kim Fedena, is called “Charles Strouse & Company” and, Mr. Strouse said yesterday, “It's even more fun than playing the piano at parties. It's a real ego trip, real kicks.” Yesterday afternoon, after a matinee of his show “Annie,” the composer was on hand to pick up a gold record, awarded because the original cast recording of the “Annie” score has sold more than 500,000 copies, a rarity these days for original cast albums. To be there, Mr. Strouse had to tear himself away from his new collaborator, Sammy Calm, with whom he is writing “Bojangles,” a musical biography of Bill (Bojangles) Robinson that they're rushing to completion in time for a spring opening.

Carter Held Strong in Minnesota As Party Prepares for Caucuses,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/06/archives/carter-held-strong-in-minnesota-as-party-prepares-for-caucuses.html,"ST. PAUL, Dec. 5— President Carter appears to be in a very strong position as activity is stepped up for February's precinct caucuses in Vice President Mondale's home state. But even if the strength holds, a CarterMondale victory may not have the desired effect. The Carter‐Mondale Presidential campaign hopes, its leaders confirm, that headlines reporting a victory in the Feb. 26 caucuses would take the edge off likely defeat the same night in New Hampshire at the hand of Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts. But those hopes are threatened, less by a Kennedy organization that is just getting started than by the strong possibility that there will be no comprehensive reporting of the Minnesota results, and that as a consequence, while out‐of‐state analysts wait for days to figure out what hap. pened here, attention will shift elsewhere.. Ulric Scott, chairman of the Democratic‐Farmer‐Labor Party, said today that he was inclined to abandon a system of getting reports from 50 sample precincts that the party used in 1972 and 1976 to report results. He said that with an active contest, there would inevitably be efforts to pack the sample precincts whose identity, he said, cannot be kept secret from the party's officials, most of whom are for Mr. Carter. Stands on Issues a Factor Another element of confusion is that in Minnesota, precinct delegates for the county conventions in March will be chosen not only for their Presidential preference but also for their stands on such issues as abortion and gun control. Nevertheless, Minnesota will eventually elect 75 delegates to the Democratic National Convention in New York, or nearly four times New Hampshire's 19. There is no sign yet, political leaders say, of a big effort for Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California. President Carter has the formal support of the state's elected Democrats, though with varying degrees of enthusiasm, except for Joan A. Growe, the Secretary of State, and Representative Richard Nolan. But in addition to those formal commitments, the Carter‐Mondale organization has had an active headquarters here for several months. It is run by Bob Meek, and its volunteers and staff are busy telephoning possible supporters. This early effort was spurred after Mr. Nolan announced his support for Mr. Kennedy last spring. Warren Spannaus, the Attorney General and the state's leading Democratic officeholder, said today that he had insisted on an early beginning as a condition for heading the operation here. Elizabeth McPike, the Kennedy coordinator and a former political worker for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said “I don't know how well we're supposed to do‐I just believe in working as hard as I can.” Mr. Spannaus and other Carter supporters made it clear in a series of conversations that they felt there were no strong anti‐Kennedy feelings in the state, and that the core of their support came from people loyal to the Vice President."
Books of TheTimes,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/07/archives/books-of-the-times-documents-and-clerks.html,"The Washington Post/Matthew Lewis Bob Woodward and Scott Armstrong, authors of “The Brethren” INSTEAD of Woodstein, Strongwood or .Armward?

Mr. Woodward. THE BRETHREN. Inside the Supreme  Court. By Bob Woodward and Scott Armstrong. Illustrated. 467 pages. Simon& Schuster. $13.95. assistant managing editor for metropolitan news at The Post, joins now with Scott Armstrong, a Post reporter„ to do for Warren E. Burger's Supreme Court what Mr. Woodward and Mr.. Bernstein did for Richard M. Nixon's Watergate, which is to read everybody's mind without identifying a single source. Documents and Clerks A few fussy qualms are in order : (1) Armward tells us that it interviewed more than 200 people, including several Supreme Court justices, “more than 170” of their law clerks, unknown scads of employees and assorted savants. Strongwood claims to have consulted eight file drawers full of “thousands of pages of documents from the chambers of 11 of the 12 justices who served during the period 1! to 1976.” The Chief Justice himself, Mr. Burger, declined to cooperate, and yet we are informed throughout of his private passions and disappointments. There is no bibliography. The footnotes, roughly one to every 10 pages of text, fail to substantiate any of the mind‐reading. If “The Brethren” were a high school term paper, any teacher in New York would give it an “F.” (2) Thus, when Charles Reich, who wrote “The Greening of America,” tells William 0. Douglas, who has suffered a stroke, “You can't even read. How are you going to decide cases?” And Douglas replies, “I'll see how the Chief votes and vote the other way,” we are entitled to wonder. We also wonder whether, when William J. Brennan, Byron (Whizzer) White and Potter Stewart had lunch on a Saturday at “a dimly lit restaurant on the other side of the Capitol. . . the Justices found themselves entering the clerks’ long‐standing debate: Was the Chief evil or stupid?” This is history written by leaks, not flashes of lightning. (3) The methodology of “The Brethren” is the same as the methodology of “The Final Days.” That is, at least somebody said it happened, so maybe it really did. (9) Most of what was reported as maybe really happening in “The Final Days” turns out, after we have read the various relevant memoirs of the variously culpable types, to have happened, really, given an irrelevant shift of emphases by the culpable. Well: so much for the principles of historiography. They have been trampled on. What remains of “The Brethren” is terrific. It is gumdrops and potato chips. According to Woodarm and Wardstrong, the Supreme Court behaves like any other committee with which I've had any acquaintance. Its scruples are relative; its personalities clash; its many pairs of eyes are on the main chance, the good opinion of posterity, the boss, the clock and sometimes the Constitution. One imagines that, even in the Agora, Socrates was hustled and there had to be backbiting. An associate justice of the Supreme Court is allowed to be ordinary. None, apparently, is more ordinary than Mr. Burger. We are advised that he delays voting until he can be in the majority or finagle the assignment of the writing of an opinion; that he is no stranger to tantrums; that his prose is bad, and that he holds a grudge. Thurgood Marshall, on the other hand, doesn't do his homework. William H. Rehnquist is an ideologue. The late Justice Douglas was an unpleasant man for whom or with whom to work. Hugo Black stayed on too long, John Marshall Harlan was nearly blind and Whizzer White had a simple rule‐ofsomething‐or‐other when it comes to “hard‐porn"": “No erections and no insertions equalled no obscenity.” Justice Brennan, the civil libertarian who gave us the “one‐man, one‐vote” decision, gets the best press in “The Brethren""; one suspects that Mr. Brennan talked the most, in deep “back‐ground.” This particular committee, we have to remind ourselves in our avidity for the details of moral defloration, was voting on how the rest of us would be obliged to behave when it came to abortion, busing, the rights of prisoners and the mentally ill, pornography, Nixon's tapes and the Pentagon Papers, among dozens of other issues, including whether or not the clerks could play basketball in street shoes on “the highest court in the land.” The role of the clerks, in fact, is crucial; they probably talked to Simon & Schuster more than Brennan did. Transcending Themselves “The Brethren” gives us deals, trade‐offs, breakdowns, snits, power plays, personal animosities, undue influences, headline‐huntings, incompetence. Reading it, one is amazed that the system works at all, until one reflects that most systems manage mysteriously to function at a higher level than their component parts would give us any reason to expect. Chief Justice Burger's opinions on blacks and Jews and women, as reported here, are so disheartening as to confirm our worst fears of what Herblock called a “Nixonburger” Court would do to us, and yet the unlikely center ‐ a Lewis Powell, a Harry Blackmun ‐ seems to hold; men of measured intellect transcend themselves spasmodically. The Court, though, needs a woman, even as this fascinating book needs documentation. Something essential a consumer warning with the gumdrops‐is missing."
ARCHITECTURE VIEW; Is This the Last Chance for Battery Park City?,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/09/archives/architecture-view-is-this-the-last-chance-for-battery-park-city.html,"If the present plan for Battery Park City goes ahead, will be the sixth version — give or take a plan or two —since 1966. If it fails, the state and city will have to write finis to one of the more curious chapters in New York's planning history. That prime waterfront land along the Hudson River edge of Lower Manhattan should go begging is curious enough in itself. The 92 acres of landfill created in part from the World Trade Center excavation and completed over a 10year period by the Battery Park City Authority, was meant to be the basis for an ambitious master plan. The possibilities of development in this spectacular location could not be more breathtaking; the site promises an unparalleled opportunity for an attractive commercial and residential mix with waterfront walks and parks and splendid river and harbor views. That promise has never been kept, for a variety of instructive reasons. Nothing has come out of 13 years high hopes and struggles except a barren expanse. In a last ditch rescue attempt, the New York State Urban Development Corporation has taken over the Battery Park City Authority and prepared a new development proposal. Part of UDC's strategy to make something happen a far less ambitious plan than any previously envisioned. The only other courses at hand are singularly grim. Either New York State will default on the Battery Park City bond issue next year (it is the last of those troublesome moral obligation bonds), something that is unthinkable terms of the state's credit rating, or it will have to ante up anything from $131 million to $310 million to redeem the bonds, depending on the speed at which they are paid off. Default or bailout are not happy alternatives. Measured against either one, UDC's proposal looks good ; in fact, would look good, simply as planning, even when not viewed from a back‐against‐the‐wall position. UDC is asking the state legislature to gamble $8 million over the next four years for a much more modest kind of development, with the hope that this can make the whole thing go. That $8 million would, essentially, buy time while keeping the Battery Park City Authority bonds afloat. To begin, the state would have to condemn the land. During that fouryear period, UDC would need to market part of the land successfully. It proposes to do so by concentrating on attracting commercial development immediately adjacent to the World Trade Center through very substantial tax advantages. With the new American Stock Exchange Building now committed to that area, and a stronger office market downtown, this seems like an opportune time. Another $35 to $50 million of state funds would be needed for streets and utilities and other initial costs. Assuming profitable venture producing the desperately needed cash flow, the state could be repaid and the bondholders satisfied. With expenses and debts taken care of, the land would then revert to the city. The present proposal has been put forward by Richard A. Kahan, who is head of both UDC and the merged Battery Park City Authority, on the basis of a study and a new master plan by Alexander Cooper Associates and a team urban experts. Mr. Cooper is an architect and former member of the City Planning Commission who combines a thorough knowledge of the city's tough urban realities with professional design expertise and not a little vision. The strongest thing going for the scheme is that it Battery Park City's last chance. But it also has some very real virtues; among them are simplicity, flexibility, logic and a reasonable scale. Instead of grafting an alien arrangement of streets and buildings onto Lower Manhattan, this plan relates to the city's familiar grid, with one brilliant twist: Battery Park City's streets would follow the diagonal Broadway axis rather than the later, right‐angled grid that was imposed on it. This would create “bias” streets with long waterfront views, and the chance of interesting intersections. Meant to be a schematic framework for flexible development, the plan would need more specific park and open space study if it goes ahead. This concept is in marked contrast to the former plan, which consisted of overreaching design ideas of epic complexity muddied by endless political juggling. A multi‐leveled megastructure was locked into a tortuous city‐state lease of demanding design specifics that made it virtually impossible to build. The new plan still faces serious obstacles. These include the current unreliability of the investment economy, the endless Westway battles that create an abyss of uncertainty at Battery Park City's western edge, and the strong psychological barrier of perceived failure thus far. Even the plan's sponsors speak of it with carefully qualified optimism. It presented as a gamble with considerable odds, but with chance of success as against total disaster. What went wrong with Battery Park City? Was it just the victim of fate, politics and finances? Or is there a planning object lesson in its history? Battery Park City was the kind of monumental blueprint that Daniel Burnham had in mind — in scale if not in style — when he exhorted his colleagues to make no little plans. But the trouble wasn't that Battery Park City's sponsors were thinking too big; it is that they weren't thinking at all. This was a scheme unrelated to the past, present or future in either economic or environmental terms. The history of Battery Park City has elements of tragedy, comedy and the absurd; it is Gilbert‐and‐Sullivan planning in which the marvelously elaborate process of compounding errors ‘takes on a life and a momentum of its own. In 1966, when Nelson Rockefeller, confirmed empire‐builder, was governor, and John Lindsay was mayor, the governor announced the scheme in press conference that caught New York City's planners by surprise. They were deeply involved in a comprehensive Lower Manhattan‐waterfront plan of their own, and were not expecting it to be blown out of the water on one side. The problem was not only that the state's plan didn't fit into the city's plan, but that it wasn't nearly as good. It was a tear‐off‐at‐the‐dotted‐line boxtop kind of design that related to nothing at all. The lack of political and architectural rapport between the governor and the mayor was no help. A team of architectural matchmakers came up with a face‐saving compromise — a “linear‐city” megastructure much in vogue in planning circles at the time. When the bottom fell out of the office building market, the financial base fell out of the scheme. Developers brought in by Battery Park City Authority's head, Charles Urstadt, in a search for housing alternatives, brought their own cookie‐cutter designs. Again, the plan doctors were brought in. Max Abramovitz added “pods” and platforms, and the landscape architects, Lawrence Halprin Associates, tried to soften the cumulative errors with remedial open space. To put it succinctly, the plan was an abortion. It was ill‐conceived to start with, overdesigned to continue, modified and muddled beyond reason, .and unrelated to market or neighborhood realities. Each attempt to fix it made it worse, or only slightly better, and no one could fix the economy. The moral is to think in terms of what can actually be built without a miracle of faith, financing, and entrepreneurial and municipal timing. Visionary Valhallas may be exhilarating exercises, but they rarely get off the presentation boards. The new, scaled‐down flexible Battery Park City plan, with its more immediate and incremental sensitivity to the city, is the way we look at planning now. With more than a little luck, this time it might even make it. ■"
THE WORLD OF MOTHER TERESA; MOTHER TERESA,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/09/archives/the-world-of-mother-teresa-mother-teresa.html,"In the sprawling slums of India, 1979's Nobel Peace Prize winner nurtures the poorest of the poor and envelops them with love. Jean‐Pierre Laffoni/Sygma 30 years ago, the tireless nun seeks out those in need and attends to their wants. “I believe in person‐to‐person,” she says, adding that, to her, “every person is Christ.” The poor, Mother Teresa says, deserve not just service and dedication but also the joy that comes from human love. In the streets of Calcutta, where her ministry began M. Sinh/Sipa‐Black Star At Nirmal Hriday, in halls where Calcutta thugs used to gamble, the ill and dying are now sheltered and tended by Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity and lay volunteers. First impression. She is remarkable in her ordinariness, a small, slight woman with a heavily creased face. There are puffy folds beneath her deepset eyes and she habitually purses her lips. She could be one of the Slavic ladies who clean the offices of Manhattan late at night. Like them, she is peasant in a big city. In her body ana movements there is the rustic efficiency of her Balkan ancestors. Mother Teresa is compact and close to the ground, the better to climb hills and till rocky soil, the easier to hug the earth in prayer. But when she smiles and laughs, which she does often, there comes the hint of special qualities. The human clay molds itself in unambiguous joy. The lines of her face become exclamation marks. As with all her emotions, she communicates pleasure purely. We first met shortly after she had been named this year's winner of the Nobel Peace Prize (which she will receive tomorrow in Oslo). Heralding the glad tidings, Calcutta's largest newspaper proclaimed: “THE MOTHER OF BENGAL IS NOW THE MOTHER OF THE WORLD.” Six days after that headline stirred India's pride for its adopted daughter's accomplishments, I was led to the small, bare second‐floor chapel at the motherhouse (the original home of the order) of the Missionaries of Charity in Calcutta. It was 4:30 in the morning. I found Mother Teresa praying with her sisters and novices, as she does at the beginning of every day. Not all the sisters can fit into the chapel at one time. Some were below in the courtyard, washing their single change of clothes in tin buckets. Mother Teresa had already done her laundry. I am a nonbeliever and I am vaguely uncomfortable among people affirming their faith. I want to be polite and I observe the protocol of worship, but I cannot share in the adoration and passions so apparent in this chapel. Instead, I spend most of the next two hours watching the small woman at prayer, sensing that in her communion lies the source of her strength and the heart of her achievements. After all, she has several times made her point, saying, “I am not a social worker. We do it for Jesus.” As I sit watching the barefoot nun at her devotions, the obvious questions repeat themselves. How could this slight, foreign‐born Roman Catholic woman have succeeded so remarkably, beginning her work in this now Communistruled city in a Hindu country? How had she, starting with almost no following, a mere 5 rupees and no powerful backers, been able to assemble the worldwide empire of love and charity that now operates 158 branch houses in 31 countries? Also, why have she and her sisters been able to work so efficiently among the poorest of the poor when governments and international agencies, with their far greater resources, have generally accomplished far less? Later in the day, when ask her these questions, she replies, as I knew she would, “I do nothing; He does it all.” Others who have written about Mother Teresa and have come under her spell have accepted this answer. Malcolm Muggeridge, the British television commentator and former editor of the magazine Punch, whose interest in Christianity is deep, if unaffiliated, has even come to believe that she is an actual saint and that her achievements can be understood only as true miracles. In “Something Beautiful for God,” his book about her work, Muggeridge has described Mother Teresa as a person “through whom the light of God shines.” This is a possible explanation, of course, but I cannot share it. Lacking faith — that quality that Mother Teresa explains as “a gift from God” — I have no other judgmental faculties but emotion and reason. Together they force a conclusion that impudently disputes her own sincere humility. The source of her success, I am convinced, rests in her own rare character, her strong pure passions and, yes, in her faith in God and love of Jesus. This perspective of mine, for which I apologize but cannot help, is not just a slight shift of emphasis. She says that she did nothing and He did it all, and I say she is responsible to a great degree. There is arrogance in my view, perhaps hubris. I wish it were avoidable. After devotions, a young French priest comes to give communion. Then Mother Teresa goes downstairs. Even before the Nobel award was announced, part of her days were spent in offering darshan, an Indian tradition where the powerful, the notable or the holy make themselves available to all comers. Some of those who come to Mother Teresa do so as supplicants. Some bring gifts and tribute and seek to touch her feet in homage. Among those waiting this particular morning is a young, crippled man who beams, “I am here because Mother loves me.” Also on hand are two well‐dressed businessmen. They seek her autographs, asking her to sign her name on, perhaps, 10 sheets of paper. From my perspective, they seem wily, and my suspicion is that they were seeking to exploit her celebrity, perhaps hoping to sell the signatures. I think Mother Teresa sees that, too, but it does not matter. They ask her to do something that is in her power and she does it. We talk. She explains what she meant when she initially responded to the news of the Nobel award by saying, “I am unworthy.” She says there were so many people in the world wiser than she, better trained, more educated. “But I know the prize is not for me, that it is for the poor and that I am receiving it in their behalf, Isn't that so?” It is clear that what she means is that the honor of the prize, as well as the money, was meant for the poor. In explaining its choice, the Nobel Committee had noted that “poverty and hunger and distress also constitute a threat to peace.” It is part of Mother Teresa's very concrete philosophy that the world needs the poor as a reservoir of love. “I am happy that the award recognizes that the works of love were works of peace,” she says. What will she say when she accepts the award in Oslo? “I will tell them to love each other as God loves each one of us.” Her words are crisp, direct. But there is a welcoming warmth in her manner. Her eyes look at me with genuine fondness. I feel she has time for me and cares about me, and not necessarily because of either my business or hers. Once she had said, “I believe in person to person; every person is Christ for me, and since there is only one Jesus, that person is the only one person in the world for me at that time.” Perhaps it is a trick, but it works, and I know better now what the crippled man had meant when he explained his presence at her darshan by saying that Mother loves him. I ask if I can spend the day with her. She says yes, but that I will find it boring. She has so many visitors who are coming. Old friends, officials, strangers. For the next few days, she is obliged to meet these people. Perhaps, she suggests, it would be better that I visit the places where her work began and continues. Malcolm Muggeridge has written that “the wholly dedicated, like Mother Teresa, do not have biographies.” Certainly the details of her personal past are subsumed by her activity. She rebuffs personal questions, or, at best, answers tersely with phrases such as, “I had a very happy childhood,” or “I wanted to be a missionary, so I came to India.” This last remark is her description of how an Albanian grocer's daughter living in Skopje, Yugoslavia, who spoke no English became a nun in British India. There are a few further details available but they include only the cold facts. The dreams, the fears, the dramas can only be imagined. She was born Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu on Aug. 17, 1910. She attended a government school and was a member of a sodality, a Roman Catholic lay woman's society. Some Yugoslav Jesuits had gone to missions in Bengal and their letters were read at meetings of the sodality. She has said that she knew she wanted to be a nun since she was 12 years old. Through the sodality, she was put in contact with the Irish Sisters of Loreto, who had missions in Bengal. In 1928, when she was 18, she went to their abbey in Dublin to study English, and later that year she was sent to the eastern Indian hill station at Darjeeling, where the Loreto Sisters had a school for the daughters of tea planters and Westernized Indians. There she began her novitiate. And this is all she has allowed to be known about her early life. Asked about her family, she will say only, “We loved each other very much.” But apparently there has been no close contact for some years, not even when her Nobel award was announced. After a year in Darjeeling, she was sent south to Calcutta to teach geography at St. Mary's High School. Calcutta in those days still had pretensions to being the “second city” of the British Empire, and St. Mary's was an exclusive school for the daughters of middle‐ and upper‐class Bengalis. Her English developed Indian cadences. She Mahendra Sinh/Sipa‐Black Star Each day. Calcutta's poor are fed by Mother Teresa's volunteers. Hindi. She was popular with the girls, and in time became principal of the school. There is no account available of her reactions to the war, when Calcutta became an objective of the Japanese advance. Or to the famine of the early 1940's, when as many as 2,000 people a day died on the city's streets; or to the accelerating excitement and tensions accompanying independence and the partition that cut Calcutta off from what is now Bangladesh. All that has been recorded is her assertion that she loved the school and that leaving it was harder than leaving home. She left because of what she says was “a call within a call” that she heard while on a train on Sept. 10, 1946. She described the moment to the Rev. Edward Le Joly, formerly one of the spiritual directors of her order, in this way: “The message was quite clear. I was to leave the convent and help the poor whilst living among them. It was an order. I knew where I belonged, but I did not know how to get there.” One slight but suggestive hint to Mother Teresa's hopes and motives when she was young rests in the name she. chose on taking her vows. Some Catholic priests, and even some of her own sisters, assume that she chose the name after St. Teresa of Avila, the 16th‐century Spanish mystic who, after a “second conversion,” left the Carmelites to found an order of barefoot nuns and helped establish an organization of friars. Actually, however, the inspiration for the young Yugoslav novice's choice was another saint, Teresa de Lisieux, the socalled “little Teresa,” a French nun of the late 19th century who was canonized in 1925, just three years before Mother Teresa became a sister of Loreto. This little Teresa, the patron saint of foreign missionaries, was an advocate of what she termed “the little way” — the accomplishing of good through the performance of the most humble tasks and the joyful undertaking of the most trivial actions. In light of the ambiguity that surrounds Mother Teresa's choice of name, it is at least possible that at different times both saints have been inspirations for her. Certainly, in her actions she has imitated the simplicity, piety and humility for which the little Teresa was revered, and she has also shown the high organizational skills, the directness of prose, the practically and humor that are ascribed to St. Teresa of Avila. Again, in the recounting of this fundamental change in her life, the story becomes simple. An obscure 36‐year‐old nun hears a call. In order to follow it, she will have to leave her order and found a new one. Permission to leave an order can be granted only by the Vatican. The then Sister Teresa made her application to Calcutta's archbishop. Whatever dramas took place are merely suggested by Father Le Joly in a book entitled “The Servant of Love: Mother Teresa and Her Missionaries of Charity.” “It took some time and much discussion and prayer for light before the archbishop was ready to apply to Rome for permission to start in his archdiocese a new religious congregation for women.” Whatever the hesitancy may have been, the bishop was persuaded and he made the various applications, the first being permission for Sister Teresa to become an unenclosed nun, living the life of a religious, but under obeidence to the Archbishop of Calcutta. On April 12, 1948, permission arrived from Rome. And on Aug. 16, 1948, a year and a day after India became an independent nation, Sister Teresa left the convent of Loreto, where she had been so happy, for the streets and slums of Calcutta. To blend more easily with the people she had set out to serve, she adopted a variation of the traditional Indian sari as her new habit ‐ a rough white cotton wraparound cloth with a blue border, and a cross worn on the shoulder. Even before starting out on her own, she had made trips to Calcutta's slums with some of her St. Mary's High School girls. And before she took up her mission to the slums, she spent three months with American nuns in Patna, on the bank of the Ganges, learning rudimentary medical skills. But evidently her plans were rather indefinite at first. Later, as she puts it, “God showed us what he wanted us to do.” It seems that for a brief time she kept some sort of diary, which she is reported to have subsequently thrown away. But before she discarded it, some priests who had seen it had copied out some entries and memorized others. One entry contains perhaps the only statement by her that approximates a complaint : “Today I learned a good lesson. The poverty of the poor must be so hard for them. While looking for a home, I walked and walked until my arms and legs ached. I thought how much they must ache in body and soul looking for a home, food, health. Then the comfort of Loreto came to tempt me, but — of free choice — my God, and out of love for you, I desire to remain and do whatever your Holy will [may] be in my regard. Give me courage, now, this moment.”’ The first person to join SisterTeresa in her new work was a 19‐year‐old Bengali girl named Subhashini Das, who had been a student at the Loreto school. She became the first novice and took her old teacher's baptismal name as her own, becoming Sister Agnes. A year and a half after Sister Agnes's arrival, the new congregation of the Missionaries of Charity was formally approved and instituted in Calcutta on Oct. 7, 1950, and Sister Teresa became Mother Teresa and a citizen of India. It was to Sister Agnes that Mother Teresa referred me when she suggested that I visit the facilities that the Missionaries maintain in Calcutta. Sister Agnes, who serves as acting superior of the order when Mother Teresa is away, is even smaller than her 5‐feettall mentor. She is also very shy, and she answers questions as briefly as possible. No, she says, back when the order began, they had no idea how it would grow. “We just wanted to serve the poor.” Poverty plays a major role in the life and thinking of Mother Teresa. For her, all people are a reflection of Jesus, but it is the poor, the dispossessed, particularly who are needful of love. For her, the love of the poor is an adoration of Christ. Once, she wrote, “Our people are poor by force, but our poverty is of our own choice. We want to be poor like Christ, who, being rich, chose to be born and liv,e and work among the poor.” But one thing that has been noticed by many who have come in contact with Mother Teresa is that she does not love the rich less. There are never appeals to possible guilts of those who are well‐off. Hers is a universal love. It's just that the poor have more urgent needs. Sister Agnes led the way to the first of Mother Teresa's major projects, the home for dying destitutes. It is a onestory building at the corner of the Kalighat Temple, that andent assemblage of shrines that is the center of Hindu veneration in the turbulent city of Calcutta. The square around the temple teems with life. There are beggars and holy men and street urchins seeking to extort guilt money from the tourists. There are merchants who sell flower petals to be offered to Kali, the goddess of destruction. At night, after their work is done, thousands of Indians throng and shove and wait to file past the temple and glimpse the idol for a few seconds. The tempo is boisterous, aggressive, jarring and alive. But things are different in the Missionaries’ building. There is a sign on the door identifying it as Nirmal Hriday, the place for the pure of heart. The light from the square sifts in with cathedral‐like shafts, but the noise is kept out. There are two large halls with rows of beds. The first is for men and the second for women. Some are unconscious. Some sit and acknowledge the greetings of visitors. It is remarkably clean, perhaps the cleanest place in Calcutta. The sisters bandage and nurse and feed the patients, helped by volunteers who come from all over the world. One of those emptying bedpans is Hari Shankat Das, a 36‐year‐old civil engineer. He has come every day for the last three years, working for two hours before goes to his office. He says he finds it comforting and restful and that he was inspired by Mother Teresa. He is of course, a Hindu. He also says that hopes that what little good he might do here might honor his parents. There are many thousands like him throughout the world who work with Mother Teresa in their own way. The remarkable thing about the home is that there is no moaning, no crying, no signs of self‐pity. Some who come regain their strength and recover, others die — but they die comforted, in cleanliness and in dignity. That was the idea of the place. Sister Agnes remembers that she was walking in the slums with Mother Teresa when the idea was born. “She found an old woman dying in the streets. We tried to get someone to take her to a hospital, but before we could, she died in the lane. Mother said there should be a place where people can die with dignity and know that they are wanted.” It is now accepted among those who know her that what Mother wants she gets, but then she was unknown and armed with nothing more than her faith. It was enough. She tackled the Calcutta Corporation — essentially, the local government. Under her onslaught, it capitulated and offered her the building at the temple square. It had been a refuge for pilgrims coming to the temple from out of town, but it had fallen into shabbiness and was being used by local thugs as a gambling den. Mother Teresa, her congregation then grown to 26, took it over. The nuns went looking for the dying. The thugs and temple hangers‐on were not immediately receptive; rocks were thrown. But among the early admissions was a man with badly rotting flesh who had been turned away from all other hospitals. He was wailing when he entered, but peaceful as his death approached. He had been a temple priest. The word got around. Today, when Mother Teresa makes her regular Sunday visit, some of the old rock throwers rush to touch her feet. More people came to know of her powers of persuasion. Among them was the late B. C. Roy, who for years was the most important man in West Bengal, serving as its chief minister, or governor. He was also a physician, and in keeping with both his own brand of populism and the custom of darshan, he offered free medical services to those who would come to his clinic at 6 o'clock in the morning. Among those who would regularly turn up at these sessions was Mother Teresa. But she did not come for medical attention. Instead, she would wait her turn and then ask Roy for advice on how to connect a water main in a slum, or how to get electricity for a school. By rising early, she had found the shortest route through the red tape that in India can ensnarl and immobilize the best intentions. Roy became one of her most powerful allies. She was given easy access to his office. Her relations with latter‐day politicians have also been good. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was an admirer and supporter of the Missionaries. When young Maoist radicals turned to terror in West Bengal in the 60's, they did not trouble Mother Teresa's nuns. Of these so‐called Naxalites, Mother once said, “We had no trouble, and sometimes they helped us.” And the Marxist government of West Bengal honored the Roman Catholic nun with an official recepton soon after her Nobel award was announced, as did the federal Government in New Delhi. And so one project led to others: an orphanage for abandoned children, a colony for lepers, a home for the elderly and bewildered, a workshop for unemployed workmen, a free‐lunch program. There was also the work during emergencies, such as floods and the refugee movements of the Bangladesh war. The children's homes developed from the school. Today, a few blocks from the Missionaries’ motherhouse on Lower Circular Road is a yellow stucco building that is the oldest of several nurseries. Unwanted babies are brought there either directly by their mothers or by those who find them in railroad stations, on church steps, or at police stations. Sister Agnes explains that, in the villages of West Bengal, if an unmarried girl has a child she loses whatever position she has and becomes a pariah. Pregnant girls who come from the countryside are placed in nursing homes, and shortly after giving birth to their babies, leave them for the sisters to look after. There are older children as well — in one dormitory, up to 7 years@@old. Here again, the remarkable thing is the mood of the place, and the cleanliness. And the children are dressed neatly, not in uniforms but in individual outfits, each different from the other's. But much more impressive is the warmth. In two hours, I heard no one say, “No,” while perhaps 80 children clambered around visitors. “They are hungry for love,” says Sister Agnes. They are getting it. From this building the Missionaries run their adoption program. Mother Teresa, whose local clinics teach natural birth control the rhythm method — opposes all artificial contraception and regards abortion as murder. “We fight abortion with adoption.” She has said that no child has ever been turned away from her centers. It is in the area of adoption and abortion that she treads closest to controversy. Some of the volunteers who work for her have complained privately that, perhaps because of the zealousness of some of her assistants, preference was being given to Roman Catholic applicants, although the bylaws of the organization say that, wherever possible, children will be placed with families sharing the religion of their natural mothers. Mother Teresa has also enraged the few Indian feminists by her references to women's roles and birth control. Addressing an international gathering in New Delhi recently, she urged women to concentrate on building stable and loving homes and “allowing men to do what they are better suited to do.” At the same time, she bitterly attacked abortion, which is legal in India. One of the feminists present said, “I suppose we just better let her have her say and keep quiet since, in terms of public relations, how can you challenge a saint?” There are some people who believe that she has been so long in Calcutta that she is unaware how many people elsewhere regard the views she holds as oppressive. “But it wouldn't make any difference to her if she were aware,” says one of her lay assistants. “Mother has her beliefs and she holds them sincerely and, anyway, her speciality is love, not moral philosophy.” Working in a Hindu country, Mother Teresa is aware of the suspicion that surrounds Christian missionaries. At the home for the dying, special care is given to insure that the dead are dealt with according to the rites of their individual faiths. The sisters consult with Hindu and Moslem societies about cremations and burials for people of those faiths, and the last rites of Roman Catholicism are not given unless requested. But there are reports that in the homes for children, dying babies are baptized, and, in the schools, the Gospel is taught. Speaking about conversion, Mother Teresa declared once, “I am not afraid to say, am in love with Jesus,’ because He is everything to me.” She added that this faith is a gift she would like to share, but one that “not even Almighty God can force a person to accept if the person does not want to.” Although some occasional doubts surface about adoptions, she has won the acceptance and the hearts of Hindus and Moslems. In another room of the children's home is a new project. Here some 20 children, severely handicapped by prolonged malnutrition, are taught, massaged and cuddied. There is among them a boy of 7 who looks as if he is only 2 years old. When he and his 5‐year‐old sister were found in a village not far from the home, neither had ever walked. Their mother, a widow, had been unable to feed them. One of the Missionaries’ sisters smiles at him and asks him to walk. With a happy, wide grin, the boy rises on pencil‐thin legs and awkwardly, twisting at the hip, walks. His sister sits crosslegged. Her legs have not yet responded to treatment. It is dreadful to imagine how they must have appeared when they first arrived. From treatment, the sisters moved to prevention. They established a clinic at the busy Sealdah railroad station, where hundreds of thousands of people arrive daily from the villages of West Bengal. Here mothers bring their children for diagnosis; family welfare is taught; innoculations are given; vitamins are dispensed, and at night safe and clean sleeping places are prowomen and children. Then there are the mobile leper centers, which travel throughout the city dispensing medicine, and a leper center out in the suburbs. There is also Prem Dan (the gift of love), a former chemical factory which was turned over unexpectedly to the sisters by its British owners. It is school, a nursery, a home for the insane and an old‐age home. One part of it is used by slum women as a factory for doormats made from coir rope, which is processed from the husks of the coconuts that glut the streets and clog the sewers of Calcutta. In addition to the religious sisters who have vowed chastity, obedience, poverty and service as Missionaries Charity, Mother Teresa has also organized thousands lay people into legions volunteers around the world. These people are linked by The International Association Co‐Workers of Mother Teresa. which is defined in its constitution as comprising “men, women, young people and children of all religious and denominations throughout the world, who seek to love God in their fellow men, through whole‐hearted free service to the poorest of the poor.” The organization combines both centralization and local autonomy. In each country a vice chairman is appointed directly by Mother Teresa, who is both the group's chief inspiration and president. The CoWorkers’ permanent secretary, Sister Frederick, lives at the order's motherhouse and tends to correspondence covering the details of projects and funds. Mrs. Ann Blaikie, a British housewife in Surrey, serves as chairman. They and Mother Teresa are the only ones who have the power to set up chapters and approve or reject campaigns. In practice, however, the national and local chapters are highly independent and are encouraged to finance their own projects. These projects range from hospital and prison visits to day‐care centers, clinics, leprosy centers and fund‐raising activities. Sometimes money is raised for local projects, sometimes for Mother Teresa's work elsewhere. Like the Missionaries of Charity, who never take out ads in Roman Catholic almanacs or periodicals, the volunteers keep a low profile. They have no public‐relations officials and they are admonished by the charter “to conduct all business affairs with economy and austerity.” Of course, blessed with the energy and personality of Mother Teresa, the chapters hardly need any public relations. If there is a center to their work, it is probably a room on the ground floor of the Missionaries’ motherhouse in Calcutta which serves as Mother Teresa's office. It is sparrely furnished, with just a bench and an uncluttered desk, and a photo of Mother Teresa with Pope John Paul II, who she says has been “very kind.” There are no voluminous files, no office machines. There is a single phone line, and for a while Mother Teresa was not certain whether even it was necessary. Most of her communication with sisters in faraway missions or with volunteers is by mail. She is said to answer all her letters, though the backlog at times runs to several months. She writes the answers, most of them by hand, late at night. Her aides, like Sister Frederick or the nuns who head the adoption program or food acquisitions, adhere to a more conventional office routine. They tend to the details while she sets the policy and offers guidance and serves as the primary link between the congregation and the world. Sometimes, the demands or her time by admirers, journal. ists and the curious are awesome. For 10 years after her order was founded, Mother Teresa was prevented by canon law from organizing missions or projects outside the archdiocese. It is clear she felt frustrated by the rule, and she appealed several times for an exemption, which is one of the few objectives she has failed to reach. Now she accepts that this was a good thing. She was able to concentrate on the education of the sisters what the local Communists would call the development of a cadre. There are currently more than 1,100 sisters and another 500 novices or postulants. It was during those 10 years, that Mother Teresa developed the Co‐Workers. When the 10‐year period ended, the machinery was in place to extend the good works. Eighty‐five centers were established in India and 65 branches of the mission now operate more than a hundred children's homes and leper centers abroad. The projects range from more houses for the destitute and dying to work with drug addicts, alcoholics and aborigines in Australia. Centers have been opened in the Bronx, in Yemen, in Jordan, in Venezuela, in Rome and in several countries in Africa. In 1965 the order was made a society of pontifical right, placing it directly under the authority of the Vatican. Two years earlier, after recognizing that some work among the poor might be more easily done by men, Mother Teresa aided in the formation of the Missionary Brothers of Charity. She is not the superior of this group of 250 brothers, since canon law prohibits a woman from heading a congregation of men, and Mother Teresa is as conservative in these matters as she is on other church doctrine. All of this expansion obviously has required money as well as energy. Yet despite the large empire she supervises, with its many houses, ambulances, massive shipments of food and considerable outlays, Mother Teresa”s attitudes toward finance would frighten most accountants. They are summed up by her certainty that “He will provide.” “Money,” she once told Father Le Joly, “I never think of it. It always comes. The Lord sends it. We do His work; He provides the means. If He does not give us the means, that shows He does not want the work. So why worry?” Once, the chairman of a large industrial company came to offer Mother Teresa a property that later became her home for the dying destitute in Bombay. He asked her how her work was financed. She asked him what made him come to her with his offer. “I felt an urge inside me,” he said. “Well,” she replied, “other people like you come to see me, and they say the same; that is my budget.” Yet her peasant practicality extends to money management as well. When Pope Paul VI gave Mother Teresa the white Lincoln Continental which had been provided for his use during his 1964 visit to India, she arranged to raffle it off, earning many times more than would have been gained by an outright sale. Furthermore, while progressive forces in India railed against the horrors of a dowry system, she saw nothing wrong in earmarking funds for the dowries of orphan girls who have grown up within her missions. Similarly, she says she is hoping to use some of the $190,000 Nobel prize money to give land and homes to her maturing children. And so she works, moving from project to project. “There is so much need, so much suffering.” And in the work there is a role for the givers. She does not solicit funds, but she cautions donors, as she used to tell her girls at St. Mary's High School, that they must not give only of their surplus. They must do without, deny themselves a meal, a dress. She has told businessmen that she does not want their money, she wants them. And in the process, in her terms, Jesus is honored, and man grows ever more human. There is yet another element to her humanness — her humor. She likes to laugh. As I returned from my visit to her homes and she was preparing for her evening prayers, she was telling her visitors how much she resented having to pay for airline tickets, and that she had once offered, in all seriousness, to work her way on Indian airlines by serving as a stewardess. She insisted her offer was serious, but it was turned down. (Since then, the Government of India has given its naturalized daughter free passes for the country's airline and railways, a mark of respect usually reserved for only the most important politicians.) Once, a visiting American couple remarked to her that, since she knew so much about love, she must be married. “Yes,” she answered, “but sometimes I cannot smile at Him.” For days after her award was announced, the motherhouse on Lower Circular Road in Calcutta was mobbed by friends, tourists, photographers and devotees. With grace, Mother Teresa made herself available. Finally, it became too much. She conveyed the feeling that the adulation was embarrassing and even somehow harmful. She announced that she would observe a month of silence. Silence, she once said, was the most important quality of religious life. If miracles are excluded as the source of Mother Teresa's success, what then accounts for it? No doubt there are others living religious lives who are equally devoted, pious, humble and in love with Jesus. Her life of self‐sacrifice is exceptional but not unique. Certainly her wonderful assortment of virtuous qualities has much to do with her attainments. But the real key. I think, is that Mother Teresa is one of those very rare people who can directly translate thought and emotions into action. Her passions are clear and unencumbered by nuance. Such notions of modernity as love‐hate and conflicting desires are alien to her. Her simplicity confounds sophisticates. People who have no trouble with psychological complexity often find her simplicity hard to comprehend. They search for comparisons, which are elusive. She is not an intellectual, like Albert Schweitzer. There are some similarities to the ideals of Tolstoy, Gandhi or Calcutta's other Nobel laureate, the author Rabindranath Tagore, but, by and large, they were all theoreticians or tacticians of love, while she is a lover. Hers is the wisdom of the heart, nurtured in convents I had not wanted to write as personally as I have about the woman many in India call simply Mother. It has proved unavoidable. By culture, I am alienated; by choice, a skeptic and by journalistic adaptation, suspicious. For 20 years have instinctively looked for the warts and wens and clay feet of journalistic subjects. Seldom have I been disappointed — almost never. With Mother it is different. I cannot accept her holiness, but her humaneness is exceptional. Some of it will surely evidence itself when she accepts the award in Oslo tomorrow. Watch, and decide for your. "
ESSAY,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/10/archives/essay-our-brethrens-keepers.html,"WASHINGTON — “A damned outrage,” said a former member of the Supreme Court. “Fourth‐hand hearsay,” agreed a present member of the Court. Both men were heatedly denouncing “The Brethren,” a new book about the hitherto secret workings of our highest tribunal by Bob Woodward and Scott Armstrong. Excerpts published in the past week dwell on backbiting between judges, gossip of clerks, and the supposed blundering or conniving of Chief Villain Warren Burger; the book itself seems to offer much more solid fare for students of political history. “Seems to” has to be inserted because the authors - to be known as Woodstrong - have adopted the same technique that made useless to historians much of the reporting of “The Final Days”: mind reading. Having unearthed a load of solid documentation (including much of the contents of Justice Brennan's safe) and having coaxed dozens of clerks and former clerks into breaking their code of confidentiality, the Woodstrong team reduces the impact of such journalistic enterprise by adopting a device of fiction — getting inside the minds of characters to say “Burger brooded” or “White thought” or “Brennan felt.” That dramatic hype was not needed ; Woodstrong had the goods, in the form of draft opinions and interoffice memos. Their leap into mind reading weakens their work. The intelligent reader knows what “Douglas thought” was not necessarlly what Douglas really thought: it was what a clerk thought he thought, or what a reporter guessed that a clerk thought another clerk thought Douglas thought. This essay opens with direct quotations from a judge and an ex‐judge, with no names given because it was at a social occasion. I put the words in quotes because I heard them with my own ears, but I cannot say what the men were thinking. Maybe they were thinking, “Here's a newsman, let's mislead him.” With that caveat established, and with additional grumbling about Woodstrong's roundheeled willingness to put in quotes what somebody recalls somebody else passed along about what a third person probably said, my hat is reverently doffed at the first unveiling of a judicial‐political institution at work. Assume “The Brethren” is 70 percent accurate; the wrongs will be set right in other memoirs and leaked rebuttals. The question that troubles some lovers of the law is this: Will this breach of the confidentiality of the judges’ conference room arguments, have “a chilling effect” (Justice Brennan's phrase in Dombrowski v. Pfister) on free and spirited argument? Of course some judges will be more cautious from now on, but the Court's members — having dismissed the inhibiting‐of‐advice argument put forth in the brief former President Nixon filed to recover his tapes and papers—can hardly apply a different standard to themselves. Outweighing the undoubted value of confidentiality is the purifying nature of publicity. An example: One of Mr. Brennan's faithless clerks says that his boss voted to deny a convicted murderer a new trial despite his expressed belief that the man deserved it. Brennan's swing vote went against his conscience because “Brennan felt that if he voted against Blackmun now, it might make it more difficult to reach him in the abortion cases or even the obscenity cases.” Brennan “felt” — Woodstrong is mind reading again. But if the charge is true, and if a judge did trade his vote on one case to buy support from a colleague on other cases — then the public ought to know about it. If true —and we do not know if the clerk's claim is true or not — then Justice Brennan betrayed the system that sees “the big picture” only in the form of justice to an individual. Another example, which we know is true: Mr. Brennan used clerks, at taxpayers’ expense, to prepare extensive histories of decisions to leave to his posterity. These were the diaries and notes that were taken from his safe and used as the primary basis for Woodstrong's book. Brennan's action in using Federal employees to edify or enrich his posterity was improper. A suit now before the Supreme Court argues that the telephone transcripts of Henry Kissinger are not his personal property, but belong to the public, partly because the records were prepared at taxpayer expense by public employees. Justice Brennan — caught doing much the same thing — will sit in judgment. I think that's wrong. Bothersome reporters turn up that sort of thing while writing irksome, hearsay‐ridden, fictionalized, sensational books. The Court's members may be quivering but the Court, as an institution is unshaken; the nation is well served by a peek at the politicking that has always accompanied the deliberations. Next week, the Court takes up the U.S.‐Taiwan treaty abrogation — let's hope at least one of the brethren is making notes."
"Board of NOW to Oppose Carter, Charging Lag on Women's Issues",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/11/archives/board-of-now-to-oppose-carter-charging-lag-on-womens-issues-must-be.html,"WASHINGTON, Dec. 10 — The executive board of the National Organization for Women, the largest feminist organization in the country, has decided to oppose President Carter's renomination or re‐election, no matter who is running aeainst him. The 27‐member executive board, the policy‐making arm of the 110,000‐member organization, discussed other candidates at a weekend meeting in New York but did not decide whom it would prefer to Mr. Carter, according to participants in the meeting. But the board decided yesterday to oppose the President because he had neither won ratification of the proposed equal rights amendment nor, in its opinion, tried hard enough to do so. The board also decided to oppose him on the ground that abortion rights had been restricted in his Administration. There were indications that the decision was not unanimous, but whether there was opposition could not be immediately determined. Sue Errington of Muncie, Ind., a member of the board, said its position was that even if the Democrats renominated Mr. Carter and the Republicans nominated a foe of women's issues, the group would still work against the President because “he must be held accountable.” Mrs. Errington said the board felt that, while Mr. Carter was on record for the amendment, his support had been weak. She also said he had not used grants and patronage to win ratification of the proposed amendment the way he was using them to promote his renomination. Rosalynn Carter, campaigning for her husband in Atlanta on Saturday, defended his efforts on behalf of the amendment. “I think we haven't passed it because people don't understand it and because there has been so much distortion about what it will do,” Mrs. Carter said. The proposed amendment, which would prohibit discrimination because of sex, was passed by Congress in 1972 and has been ratified by 35 states. Three more are needed for its adoption. In October 1978, Congress extended the deadline for ratification from last March 22 to June 30, 1982. Mrs. Carter also said her husband had appointed more women to “top jobs” in the Government than any other President, and accused his principal challenger for the Democratic nomination, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, of discovering women's issues only “because it was politically expedient to appeal to women's groups who carry large blocs of votes.” Technically, the executive board merely recommended a negative endorsement of Mr. Carter to the group's political action committee. The committee then adopted it as its position and scheduled a meeting on a possible positive endorsement for January. The board's action, like that of any large organization, hardly carries with the expectation of unanimous support by its membership. The organization is a broadly based group with a wide network of members and chapters across the country and is becoming increasingly political in its orientation. The fast‐growing organization has not been heavily involved in electoral votes in the past. Mrs. Errington said the other main objection of members of the board to Mr. Carter's record involved “abortion and reproductive rights.” She said that “we feel that women have lost enormous rights in his Administration,” and contended that strict interpretations of restrictive Federal legislation had denied abortion rights to poor women, women and dependents serving in the armed forces and women serving in the Peace Corps. Those interpretations, she said, had the President's “implicit approval.” Another important concern at the board meeting, according to NOW's Northeast regional director, Lois Galgay Reckitt of South Portland, Me., was its feelings that Mr. Carter had “placed women's concerns at the very bottom of his domestic priorities.” The board's decision, scheduled to be announced later this week, does not include a choice of an alternative to Mr. Carter. But sources close to the organization's leadership indicated that it was looking favorably to Senator Kennedy, and that he was listening very well. One person, who is active in women's politics, said one move that had impressed feminists was that Mr. Kennedy had women actively involved in the development of his positions on all issues, not just on “women's issues.” The report that the board had decided to oppose Mr. Carter regardless of who was running against him was disputed by Betty Friedan, the feminist author, who was present for the first part of the meeting although she is not a member of the board and left before the meeting ended. “It didn't happen,” she said of the board's decision to recommend a negative endorsement. “I'm sure it didn't happen. It would be ridiculous — there is no way NOW would be for somebody like Connally or Reagan.” “My understanding is that a very strong warning was issued to Carter,” she continued. “The sentiment was certainly that, unless he does more than he has done, he would not get the support of women.” She said she was personally opposed to endorsing anyone at all right now, and added: “Our priority has to be to get E.R.A.”"

"Strict Jersey Abortion Law Voted, But the Governor Considers a Veto",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/11/archives/strict-jersey-abortion-law-voted-but-the-governor-considers-a-veto.html,"TRENTON, Dec. 10 — The New Jersey Assembly gave final passage today to a ■ bill that would require women seeking abortions to sign a consent form and wait at least 24 hours before the abortion. The bill, one of the strictest in the nation, would also prohibit abortions in clinics after the 12th week of pregnancy, and would require physicians to warn women of the physical and psychological effects of an abortion. Physicians would also have to notify the parents of women under 18 seeking an abortion. Governor Byrne has suggested he might veto the bill because of doubts about its constitutionality. Originally, the bill declared that it was the state's position that life began at conception, and that women seeking abortions would have to acknowledge that an abortion would kill an unborn child. The 51‐to‐19 vote in the Assembly today was to concur in a Senate amendment striking that language from the bill. In other action today, the Senate, by a 21‐to‐5 vote, extended the life of the State Commission of Investigation for five years and voted 38 to 1 to give final legislative approval to a procedure to be used in court when news reporters decline to reveal sources. The second bill was prompted by a case last year involving M. A. Farber, a reporter for The New York Times. Mr. Farber was jailed for several weeks and The New York Times fined after he refused to divulge news sources in the murder trial of Dr. Mario Jascalevich, who was subsequently acquitted of charges that he had murdered several patients by injecting them with curare. The measure approved today and sent to Governor Byrne would require that a reporter not be ordered to reveal sources of confidential information unless it was shown that the information was necessary to a defendant, that it could not be obtained from any “less intrusive source” and that the value of the information as to guilt or innocence outweighed the value to society of allowing reporters to keep sources confidential. Mr. Byrne is expected to sign the bill."
"Mother Teresa, Receiving Nobel, Assails Abortion",https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/11/archives/mother-teresa-receiving-nobel-assails-abortion-bridging-gulf-from.html,"OSLO, Dec. 10 (AP) — Mother Teresa, Calcutta's Saint of the Gutters, accepted the $192,000 Nobel Peace Prize today in the name of the poor, the sick and the unwanted children. She also denounced abortion as “the greatest destroyer of peace.” United Press International Abdus Salam of India, Nobel Prize winner in physics, at banquet with Queen Silvia of Sweden The 69‐year‐old Roman Catholic nun, a native of Yugoslavia, said she would use the money, along with $70,000 from her Norwegian People's Prize, to build homes for lepers in her worldwide Missionaries of Charity organization. She asked that the traditional Peace Prize dinner be canceled so the $6,000 allocated for it could be used for her work. Prof. John Sanness, chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, presented Mother Teresa with a check, a Nobel gold medal and a diploma in the afternoon ceremony in the great frescoed hall of the University of Oslo. Praising her three decades of selfless service to the poor, he urged that rich nations, in assisting poorer nations, emulate Mother Teresa's spirit and respect for individual human dignity. “Mother Teresa has personally succeeded in bridging the gulf that exists between the rich nations and the poor nations,” he said. “Her view of the dignity of man has built a bridge. All aid given by the rich countries must be given in the spirit of Mother Teresa.” Mother Teresa told the audience: “Our poor people are great people, a very lovable people. They don't need our pity and sympathy. They need our understanding love and they need our respect. We need to tell the poor that they are somebody to us, that they, too, have been created by the same loving hand of God, to love and be loved.” Her tiny figure clad in the traditional sari of India, she stood beneath biblical murals, beamed her radiant smile and led her listeners in St. Francis of Assisi's prayer for peace. Though she usually steers clear of controversy, Mother Teresa chose to press her longstanding opposition to abortion. “To me the nations with legalized abortion are the poorest nations,” she said. “The greatest destroyer of peace today is the crime against the innocent unborn child.” At her mission in Calcutta, where she started helping the poorest of the poor in 1946, Mother Teresa and those who work with her try to place unwanted children through adoption. They also teach a version of the traditional church‐approved rhythm method of birth control. The nun, the sixth woman to win the coveted award since its establishment in 1901, is to give a formal acceptance speech tomorrow. Since her arrival Saturday she has insisted on maintaining the fast‐paced austerity of her life in Calcutta. 10 Honored In Stockholm STOCKHOLM, Dec. 10 (AP) — Ten Nobel laureates, five of them American, were honored here today in ceremonies that placed strong emphasis on the growing role of third‐world countries in the international community. The laureates included the first Pakistani and the first black economist, a native of the West Indies, to win Nobels in areas other than peace. Sune Bergstrom, president of the Nobel Foundation, stressed the importance of basic research and investment in “human capital” in the industrializing nations of the third world. A nuclear physicist, Abdus Salam, 53 years old, honored for his work in England and Italy, became the first Pakistani and the first Moslem scientist to win prize. Sir Arthur Lewis, 64, a West Indian, honored for his work with developing nations, became the first black to win the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science. He shared it with Theodore W. Shultz, 77, of the University of Chicago. The Greek poet Odysseus Elytis, 68, received the literature prize. Sharing the prize in physics with Mr. Salam were two Harvard professors, Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg, both 46‐year‐old natives of New York, for theoretical work in electromagnetism performed more than a decade ago. A London‐born Purdue professor, Herbert C. Brown, 67, shared the chemistry prize with an 82‐year old West German researcher, Georg Wittig, whose “Wittig Mother Teresa of Calcutta holding award she received in Stockholm. reaction” is one of organic chemistry's most important formulas. This year's Nobel in medicine was shared by a British engineer, Godfrey N. Hounsfield, 60, and Allan M. Cormack, 55, of Tufts, for their pioneering work on computer‐assisted X‐ray technique known as CAT scan. Their selection by the Royal Caroline Medico‐Surgical Institute aroused debate on whether the prizes should reward practical or applied research."

House Acts to Allow States To Bar Abortion Financing,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/12/archives/house-acts-to-allow-states-to-bar-abortion-financing.html,"WASHINGTON, Dec. 11 — The House extended the prolonged controversy over abortion policy to the state level today when it adopted an amendment specifying that states could not be required to pay for all “medically necessary” abortions. The abortion language was attached to a bill, passed by the House on a voice vote, to expand Medicaid health care for millions of needy children and pregnant women at a cost of $5.5 billion in the next five years. A Senate committee has approved much less costly health care measure but it has not vet reached the Senate floor. Because of the Senate delay and House action injecting the abortion issue into the bill, it appears unlikely that Congress will complete action this year on the child health measure. More stringent than any abortion policy ever adopted in either house of Congress, the amendment approved today by the House seeks to negate recent state court opinions holding that states must finance all “medically necessary” abortions. While the Senate and House have had continuing feud for several years over Federal abortion policy, the House action marked the first time that any Congressional attempt had been made to deal with the issue on the state level. Proposed by Representative Robert E. Bauman, Republican of Maryland, the so‐called “states rights” abortion amendment was adopted by a vote of 235 to 155. Under the amendment, federally financed abortions would be limited to those in which a mother's life was endangered. This is the normal House position, first espoused by Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois. The Bauman proposal went beyond the “Hyde amendment” by stipulating that nothing in the Federal Medicaid law “shall be construed to require any state funds to be used to pay for any abortion.” Mr. Bauman said that state courts in Ohio, Illinois, California, New Jersey, West Virginia, Michigan and several other states had held that the “Hyde amendment” applied only to the section of Federal law dealing with Medicaid abortions and not the entire law. He said that courts had further cited other sections of Medicaid law saying that states must provide medically necessary services and had thus held this to mean that states must finance all “medically necessary” abortions. “My amendment merely makes plain that states have the right to set their own policies on whether to use their own money for abortions,” Mr. Bauman said. The Senate, which has consistently been less conservative on the abortion issue, is considered certain to balk at the amendment. Twice in recent months the Senate and House deadlocked over abortion policy as they sought to enact an emergency money bill to finance departments and agencies whose regular appropriations bills have not yet cleared Congress. Both times the Senate and House reached a fragile compromise, restricting abortions to cases in which a mother's life was endangered and to cases of rape and incest. In other debate on the bill, Republicans sought to prevent the expansion of Medicaid benefits from becoming automatic that is, not subject to annual authorizations and appropriations — but they lost, 226 to 152. However, the House, by a vote of 226 to 162, subsequently voted to require Congress to review the legislation in 1984. The bill, by setting new national income‐eligibility standards for poor children, would place five million additional needy children under the Medicaid program. The new standards would provide mandatory coverage for children up to age 18, instead of six, as the law now stipulates."
NOW'S CARTER STAND PERPLEXES FEMINISTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/12/archives/nows-carter-stand-perplexes-feminists-officials-of-other-womens.html,"Representatives of many women's groups around the country reacted with surprise and, in some cases, consternation yesterday at the news that the policymaking board of the National Organization for Women decided last weekend to oppose President Carter for re‐election, no matter who runs against him. Without exception, leaders of other groups said that they would not yet follow the lead of the organization's board. At the White House, Sarah Weddington, assistant to the President, criticized the board's move as showing “a political lack of maturity.” “To have them say they would support Republican candidates who absolutely oppose the E.R.A. and women's issues, in preference to a President who has been a longtime supporter, is truly disappointing in political judgment,” she said, referring to the proposed equal rights amendment to the Constitution. Although an announcement on the NOW decision was planned at some point, the report about it yesterday in The New York Times apparently caught the organization by surprise. “It has been a difficult morning,” said Judy Goldsmith, the group's executive vice president. Eleanor Smeal, the president, refused to comment, but the group hurriedly scheduled a news conference for tomorrow morning in Washington to release an official statement. While officials of various other women's groups agreed with NOW's assessment of President Carter's record, many expressed doubt that such an early statement of opposition was good strategy. “Every organization has to make its own decisions,” said Carol Silverthorn, acting executive director of the National Women's Political Caucus, “but this differs from the kind of action we might take. I'm surprised they did this. The rumor was all over the country that NOW was going to endorse Senator Kennedy this weekend, and we were concerned that they would perhaps do so without getting much in return.” Karen Mulhauser, executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League, had a similar response. “We agree with the reasons behind the NOW decision,” she said, “but it seems like an unusual strategy at this point, one we cannot support and would not do ourselves.” Other feminists continued to caution against hasty commitments to alternative candidates. “There is no doubt there is great disgust about what Carter has not done,” said Betty Friedan, “but it is absolutely premature to endorse anybody else until we find out we're going to get more than promises from anybody else.” The group's resolution, accordingto board members who attended the weekend meeting in New York, condemned Mr. Carter's performance on women's issues, particularly the proposed equal rights amendment and abortion. “He has sold us out,” said Anne Gannon, a board member. Mr. Carter has opposed Medicaid funding of abortions, and while he supports the proposed amendment, many feminists accuse him of having failed to use the full powers of his office to win ratification of the amendment, which has been stalled three states short of adoption since Mr. Carter took office. Other NOW board members insisted that the group intended to continue to oppose Mr. Carter even if he won the Democratic nomination and faced a Republican who did not support women's issues. “That is the feeling at this time,” said Maureen Rogman of Evanston, Ill. But she added that members reserved the right to change their opinions."

Rhodes Says He Expects to Quit as Republican Leader,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/13/archives/rhodes-says-he-expects-to-quit-as-republican-leader-succeeded-ford.html,"WASHINGTON, Dec. 12 — Representative John J. Rhodes, Republican of Arizona, said today that he did not expect to seek another term as minority leader in the next Congress, but he added that he would run for the Speaker's post if the Republicans gained control of the House next year. Mr. Rhodes, a conservative, was criti cized earlier this year by House Republicans who said he worked too closely with Democrats and failed to provide aggressive leadership. He was assured a tough fight for re‐election as minority leader, but he said today that that had nothing to do with his “expectation” of giving up the post. “It's just a general feeling of frustration in knowing what ought to be done, and not having the votes to do it,” Mr. Rhodes said in an interview. “Nobody should be minority leader for more than seven years.” Mr. Rhodes said that he would be a candidate for re‐election as minority leader only if the campaign to succeed him turned into a fratricidal struggle. In that case, he said, he would enter the campaign as a peacemaker. Succeeded Ford in 1973 Mr. Rhodes, who is 63 years old, was elected to Congress in 1952 and became minority leader in 1973, succeeding Gerald R. Ford, who was appointed Vice President by President Nixon. Mr. Rhodes came under sharp attack from the 35 Republican freshmen earlier this year. “We wanted a more aggressive style and a lot more leadership,” said Representative John J. Rhodes yesterday after announcing he might not continue as minority leader. Representative Ed Bethune of Arkansas, chairman of the Republican freshmen. The freshmen expressed their dissatisfaction by running a protest candidate, Representative Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, for chairman of the House Republican Conference after Representative John B. Anderson stepped down to run for the Republican Presidential nomination. Mr. Hyde lost by three votes to the vice chair man, Representative Samuel L. Devine of Ohio. “By that effort we got the attention of the leadership,” Mr. Bethune said, “and they got the message.” Two conservative Republicans indicated in interviews that they would be candidates for the minority leader's post. They are Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the minority whip, and Representative Guy Vander Jagt of Michigan, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. Mr. Hyde, the author of an amendment that restricts the use of Federal funds for abortions, said he would be a candidate to succeed Mr. Michel as minority whip. Mr. Rhodes's decision came amid indications that he would face a tough fight to retain his post as minority leader. “The days of getting to the top around here without any competition are over,” Mr. Michel said. “Either you go for broke and find out where you really are among your colleagues, or you get out.” Mr. Vander Jagt said he was “definitely going to run” if Mr. Rhodes stepped down as minority leader. Mr. Rhodes insisted that he was not afraid of competition. “I don't feel threatened by anybody,” he said. The only things he would miss, he said, were the leadership meetings at the White House and his car and chauffeur. “I could put in a very enjoyable two years, at least, as senior statesman,” Mr. Rhodes said. Nor did he believe that it was unrealistic to discuss the possibility of the Republicans capturing the House, where the Democrats now hold a 275‐to159 majority. There is one vacancy. “We only need to gain 59 seats,” he said."

NOW'S CHIEF BARRED FROM CARTER PARLEY Group Conducts a Protest Outside White House as Other Women Confer on Rights Effort,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/14/archives/nows-chief-barred-from-carter-parley-group-conducts-a-protest.html,"WASHINGTON, Dec. 13 — As a small group of demonstrators from the National Organization for Women protested outside in the rain, representatives of two dozen other national women's groups met with President Carter at the White House today to discuss the proposed equal rights amendment to the Constitution. Group Conducts a Protest Outside White House as Other Women Confer on Rights Effort The White House rescinded its invitation to Eleanor C. Smeal, president of NOW, after the group's political action committee passed a resolution last weekend assailing President Carter for what it termed his lack of commitment to the ratification drive for the rights amendment and his opposition to Medicaid financing for abortions. The NOW executive board has decided not to endorse Mr. Carter for re‐election. Mrs. Smeal, who had originally requested the meeting with Mr. Carter, joined the demonstrators while other women's leaders met with Carter Administration officials in the presence of reporters. Then the women met for 45 minutes with Mr. Carter in private. “He said for the first time that he considers the E.R.A. to be a politically attractive issue,” Cristine Candela, president of Women's Equity Action League, said afterward. “He said there was nothing he would not do, within the limits of his own personal integrity, to get it passed. I think the issue has taken a fresh priority with the President. ‘Cautious Optimism’ Cited “We do not feel he's built an impressive record on E.R.A., but I think there's reason for some cautious optimism,” she added. During the Carter Presidency, the ratification drive has remained three states short of the necessary approval by 38. In the first stage of today's meetings, designed to outline the Administration's record on a variety of women's issues, Rosalynn Carter joined the Presidential advisers Sarah Weddington and Stuart E. Eizenstat ; John P. White, deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Eleanor Holmes Norton, chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Mrs. Weddington expressed an interest in meeting frequently with the group. Mr. Carter reportedly expressed a similar desire. “Basically he said, ‘You work out a strategy and then tell me what you want me to do,’ “ reported Anne Wexler, an assistant to the President, who said that Mr. Carter had promised to hold monthly meetings on the ratification drive with the group that assembled today. Session Termed ‘Fraudulent’ Protesting outside, NOW officials charged that the meeting was “fraudulent” because they said it purported to be a serious forum for the issues but was really only a “showcase meeting” to court women's support for Mr. Carter's re‐election campaign. In an interview yesterday, Sarah Weddington, the Carter assistant, said that she indicated to Mrs. Smeal last week that “if NOW took political action over the weekend it would make it very awkward to include her in the meeting with the President. “The meeting is to consult with a number of women to ask their advice on women's issues and it's obvious NOW is not interested in a serious dialogue about them,” she continued. “Nor are they really committed to the issue of the E.R.A., because to say that you would oppose a President who is in favor of the issue and support someone who is against it is politically self‐defeating and it makes it difficult to take their advice seriously.” Some of the women attending the meeting today said it had been more political than substantive. Carter Called ‘Out of Touch’ “If Mr. Carter doesn't understand how to use the power of his Presidency for ratification, I certainly felt he understood today how he could use the White House for support of his campaign,” said Iris Mitgang, chairman of the National Women's Political Caucus. “But I don't think the E.R.A. was adequately addressed,” she added. “I thought the President was out of touch with information that could have been readily available to him on the state‐bystate situation and on the status of the Idaho rescission case.” The Idaho case challenging the state Legislature's vote to rescind ratification of the amendment, which prompted NOW's request for the meeting today, involves a controversy over a Mormon Church official, Judge Marion Callister of the Federal District Court in Boise, Idaho, the presiding judge in the challenge case. Some women's groups believe Judge Callister should disqualify himself from the case in view of the recent action by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints (Mormon) to excommunicate a Virginia woman because of her work in behalf of the rights amendment. Although Mrs. Smeal was excluded from the meeting with Mr. Carter, she did meet this morning with Attorney General Benjamin R. Civiletti about the Callister case. NOW has requested intervenor status in the case but has been denied that role by Judge Callister. The group is appealing the judge's denial and is asking the Justice Department to take action in the case. Today's meeting with the Attorney General was inconclusive, according to Mrs. Smeal, who said, “We gave our opinion, but they did not give an opinion.” The New York Times/Teresa Zabala President Carter, meeting at the White House with women's groups, was joined by Patricia Hill Burnett of the National Association of Commissions on the Status of Women. Seated behind Mr. Carter was Sarah Weddington, an assistant."
The ‘Green’Irish Prime Minister Charles James Haughey,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/14/archives/the-green-irish-prime-minister-charles-james-haughey.html,"DUBLIN —; They call Charlie Haughey the Teddy Kennedy of Ireland. The two share several attributes: popularity among rank‐and‐file political workers, a certain magnetism that comes across even in their inarticulate moments, private wealthand its privileges, membership in a political dynasty and a rather cloudy past. It need hardly be added that Charles James Haughey, like Edward Moore Kennedy, has powerful enemies as well as positive friends. Man in the News Even by the rough‐and‐tumble standards of Irish politics, the election of Mr. Haughey as Prime Minister Tuesday was greeted with harsh language. Conor Cruise O'Brien, an old political foe who edits The Observer in London, wrote in that paper that Mr. Haughey was an ogre with a “faint touch of brimstone” about him. Dr. Garret FitzGerald, the opposition leader, termed him a man of “flawed pedigree” and “overweening ambition.” Mr. Haughey's roots lie in the tormented province of Northern Ireland. He is one of half a dozen men essential to a solution of the problems there, and he can be expected to commit himself to undoing the partition of 1920. On Dec. 7 he was chosen by a six‐vote margin as leader of the Fianna Fail party because a majority of his parliamentary colleagues were tired of the policies of John Lynch, his predecessor, who has de‐emphasized the party's longstanding commitment to national unity. In addition, they were convinced that Mr. Haughey, who is 54 years old and whose the name is pronounced HAWKH‐ee, would do something about Ireland's economic troubles, in the process helping them hold their seats. He was also elected because he is “green,” an all‐out republican who subscribes wholeheartedly to Fianna Fail's basic doctrine, which calls for British withdrawal from the North and reunification of the country. However, he is not expected to endorse the terrorist activities of the Provisional Irish Republican Army; indeed, he condemned them at his first news conference after the caucus. Mr. Haughey's reputation for republicanism is founded upon a single event, albeit one of the most shocking in the republic's short history. In 1970, when he was serving as Finance Minister, he was twice tried for conspiracy to use Government funds to smuggle arms into Ireland for the use of the I.R.A. After an abortive first trial he was acquitted in the second; nonetheless he languished in the political wilderness for seven years, viewed by many as a republican martyr. On the other hand, there are those who recall that as Minister of Justice in the early 1960's he imprisoned known I.R.A. agents, and among I.R.A. activists there is a suspicion that his “greenness” is that of a chameleon who finds it a useful political cloak. A minister who voted against Mr. Haughey said that he expected the new Prime Minister to talk tough, to “give the British an elbow or two in the ribs,” but to do nothing that would increase violence. Student of Law and Accounting Friends and enemies agree that Charlie Haughey — he is one of those politicians who is known to no one by his formal name — has unusual competence, if not always the best judgment, and tremendous determination. Born Sept. 16, 1925, in Castlebar, in County Mayo, one of the sections of Ireland that supplied tens of thousands of immigrants to the United States, Mr. Haughey is from a family that was in the Roman Catholic minority in the North until Protestant vigilantes burned the family farm and forced its inhabitants to flee. Mr. Haughey's father was an officer in the original I.R.A. and the new Free State's army. At University College in Dublin, the son studied law and accounting and went on to make a fortune in real estate in the boom of the 1950's and 60's. Having married the daughter of Prime Minister Sean Lemass in 1951, he began his political career early, entering Parliament in 1957 at the age of 32. By 1961 he was Minister of Justice. Camera Press Expects to commit himself to the reunification of Ireland. His most recent post was Minister of Health, and he glided through that notorious political minefield, underlain with delicate issues such as contraception and abortion, with the skill of tightrope walker. Once a heavy drinker and smoker, he stopped smoking and cut back to one or two social drinks, earning headlines in the process. A short but sturdily built man, Mr. Haughey likes to ride horses to begin his day, and he breeds thoroughbreds on his 280‐acre estate near Dublin. He and his wife, Maureen, and their four children live in a Georgian manor house on the estate; he also owns an island retreat off the southwest coast. He showed his flair for the unexpected this fall when the Cabinet was invited to meet Pope John Paul II during his visit to Dublin. The other ministers lined up on one side of the room to shake the Pope's hand, but Mr. Haughey, according to someone on the scene, managed to station himself on the other side, where he got more papal attention."
Around the Nation Court Rejects Plea to Bar Trial in '65 Rights Slaying,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/14/archives/around-the-nation-court-rejects-plea-to-bar-trial-in-65-rights.html,"MONTGOMERY, Ala., Dec. 13 (AP)—A state appeals court today refused to block the prosecution of Gary Thomas Rowe Jr., a former F.B.I. informer, for the 1965 slaying of a civil rights worker, Viola Gregg Liuzzo. Around the Nation Court Rejects Plea to Bar Trial in '65 Rights Slaying In a unanimous decision, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals denied a motion that the state be prevented from prosecuting Mr. Rowe on first‐degree murder charges. The justices did not address themselves to the argument of J. Paul Lowery, Mr. Rowe's attorney, that Mr. Rowe had been granted full immunity from prosecution by the state in return for his testimony against Ku Klux Klansmen who were charged with the Liuzzo slaying. Assistant Attorney General Sarah Kathryn Farnell told the court that, even if Mr. Rowe had immunity, there was reason to believe “Rowe possibly lied” in testifying against the Klansmen and thus “did not fulfill his part of the bargain.” 14 of 15 Indicted in Deaths Of 5 Communists at Rally GREENSBORO, N.C., Dec. 13 (UPI)—A grand jury today returned indictments against 14 of 15 Ku Klux Klansmen and Nazis charged in the shooting deaths of five Communists at a “Death to the Klan” rally last month. The grand jury returned murder and conspiracy indictments against 13 of the men and a conspiracy indictment against Claude M. McBride Jr., 16 years old, of Winston‐Salem. Mr. McBride's stepfather, Rayford Milano Caudle, 37, who had also been charged with conspiracy, was not indicted. The men were arrested after the Nov. 3 shootout between members of the Communist Workers Party and a group of Klansmen and Nazis. Florida Abortion Provisions Struck Down by U.S. Judge MIAMI, Dec. 13 (AP) — A Federal judge today struck down two sections of Florida's abortion law requiring doctors to obtain permission for abortions from persons other than the pregnant woman. District Judge Sidney Aronovitz said the sections, enacted in 1979, “are constitutionally defective in that they impermissibly invade a woman's fundamental right to privacy in the abortion decision.” One of the affected sections required a physician to obtain written permission from a “parent, custodian or legal guardian of an unmarried minor,” unless “good cause” was shown, before performing an abortion on an unmarried minor. The other required that the husband of a married woman be informed of the proposed abortion. Convicted Carolina Killer Granted Stay of Execution DURHAM, N.C., Dec. 13 (AP) — Eighteen hours before he was to die in the electric chair, a convicted killer, Joseph Carl Shaw, won an indefinite stay today from a Federal appeals judge who said all issues should be considered before such an “extraordinary” event was carried out. Mr. Shaw, 24 years old, who confessed killing two teen‐agers in 1977, had been scheduled to die in the electric chair at the Central Correction Institution in Columbia, S.C., at 5 A.M. tomorrow. But Judge J. Dickson Phillips of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit granted the stay in Durham after an hour‐long hearing with defense attorneys and lawyers for the South Carolina Attorney General's office. Judge Phillips set no time limit on the stay and did not state a reason for his decision. He said he would file a memorandum later outlining the grounds for his decision. Condominiums in Florida Upheld on Banning Children TALLAHASSEE, Fla., Dec. 13 (AP) —The more than two million elderly Florida residents, many of whom live in condominiums, are best served by letting condominium associations ban young children, the state Supreme Court ruled in a unanimous decision today. The court said, however, that age restrictions must be applied uniformly and that they could not be used to discriminate against a family with young children if other children already live on the premises. Although the court upheld the right of condominium agreements to set age restrictions, it rejected efforts by White Egret Condominium of Fort Lauderdale to block co‐ownership of a unit by Norman Franklin, who has children under age 12, and his brother Marvin. Marvin Franklin bought a White Egret unit as a vacation home, then transferred half ownership to his brother. The association objected, claiming that Norman Franklin was violating a rule prohibiting young children. The justices ruled that White Egret was being arbitrary when it tried to ban the Franklin children because six other young children already were living on the premises. Georgia Hospital Closing Fought by James Roosevelt ATLANTA, Dec. 13 (AP) — Warm Springs Hospital should be closed, says a state study group, but James Roosevelt has threatened to sue to keep open the facility that treated his father, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, for polio. The recommendation now goes to the State Board of Human Resources, which is expected to approve it, according to and aid to Gov. George D. Busbee. But James Roosevelt said that the state had a contractual commitment to operate the facility until at least 1989, and that a suit would be filed soon to ask that the contract be honored."
The Wolfe at the Door,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/15/archives/the-wolfe-at-the-door.html,"AKRON, OHIO Christmas break was about week away. Those evenings we sat on the steps of the monument of the park uptown and drank sweet red wine from the bottle, waiting for an Indian‐summer sunset to glow over the small college town, wasting “ our time with cheap talking wine. Seniors, we would graduate in the spring and, though it was many months away, nothing else seemed to matter. Graduation would mean going home: abandoning friends who had been four years in the making, and we know that in “these troubled times” friends weren't all that easy to come by. Encounter groups, yes. Friends, no. We had been told you could never go home again, and we believed our professors. As the sun set and the street emptied, we finished our bottle and pooled pocket change to buy another, and later, yet another. Bad wine was as much a part of college as books, and though no cure, it certainly did seem to be remedy. Soon, the sidewalks and bars began to fill with students, but we stayed on the monument. The bars were for the others. In a week, the town would purge itself of students. All would head home for the holidays to eat Christmas cookies, forget about Gatsby's green light and sleep in a bed grown strange: strange because our lives had changed since that September day four years before when our parents had dropped us off school. They had no idea. They didn't know that the world of college was like another country. Drugs of all colors, strengths and types went for the asking. Bartenders knew when the barbiturates hit town by the number of students falling out of their chairs on any given evening. Pot was smoked anywhere at anytime by everybody. Alcoholism ranked right behind V.D. on the top‐10‐disease list and both were epidemics. An abortion was like having a tooth pulled. The studies said we were illiterate. On the monument with the bottle between us and night and winter closing in, one felt lost within a lost generation. Students of the 70's, we had had to deal with the excesses of the 60's, and we knew that in the years to come we'd miss each other. When we were freshmen and said goodbyeto our parents, mother was crying and the shadow of a tear was in the Old Man's eye as he unloaded the suitcases and boxes. They remembered 3 A.M. feed ings, skate keys and bicycles. There on the sidewalk, they knew that something was slipping away besides the warm days of summer. And we wondered, hunkered on that statue dedicated to a hero from one of the wars, wondered what it would be like to leave the ivory tower forever, a place where wire‐rimmed professors hush‐puppied through alleys of tweed and tobacco, where leaves fell on the green, and at noon the bells chimed the alma mater. We wondered about adaptation and assimilation, about living rooms in suburbia and about poets who died young and tubercular. We wondered about insurance salesmen. We wondered about polyester. Fall finals was a week of overflowing ashtrays, sleepless nights, speed and coffee and then they were over and done with and it was time to pack blue jeans and flannel shirts and catch a bus home. It was hip to dress like a cowboy or lumberjack and it was hip to ride buses home, reading Kerouac Kesey as the bus rolled through the small Ohio towns. The light from the gas‐station signs fell through the fogged window to the floor and the snow was soft and white and scattered the night as freeway turned into expressway and finally familiar exits. The bus station was the seamy side of Christmas, not at all like a paperback book. Then the family car was framed in the doorway and there was a mad rush through the knee‐deep snow to it. We were shaking hands and saying hello and falling into the backseat, into its warm security. Thomas Wolfe wasn't quite right about that never going home. Or maybe those professors were wrong. No one ever really leaves. John Eckberg is managing editor of The Signal, a weekly newspaper published in Canal Fulton, Ohio. David Suter"
Abortion: Facing Realities,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/15/archives/abortion-facing-realities.html,"VILLANOVA, Pa. — When I left the United States a little more than a year ago, I believed that the controversy over abortion had been finally, if unhappily, settled. With one million or more legal abortions every year, mostly involving women with no previous history of abortion, there seemedto be a growing committed constituency on the side of the courts, if not of the angels. The vociferous “pro‐life” minority appeared to be struggling for a hopeless cause. To talk of searching for a middle position seemed pointless at best. My experience in the three months since I have returned has led me to revise my conclusions about the stability of this resolution, largely as a result of events in October. The first was the National Conference on Abortion. The conference, held at Notre Dame University, represented an attempt to arrange a forum where the two extremes could begin to conduct a dialogue. Although the speakers and the audience were, for a change, drawn from both sides, I could not escape the impression that the “pro‐choice” people felt themselves to be on the run, and not merely because they were outnumbered at the conference. Over and over, I heard expressions of anxiety over losing the battle — the millions of women who have had abortions prefer not to be heard from, and the minority who are really committed to choice seems hardly greater than the minority actively committed against it, if they are even that many. Only one week after participating in the conference, I witnessed the Philadelphia version of National Abortion Rights Action Week. Again I saw anxiety, at times approaching desperation, in strong contrast to the almost jubilant spirit among the “pro‐life” groups. This desperation is perhaps best illustrated by the increasingly shrill assertion of spdcious arguments by the “pro‐choice” groups — for example, that proposed “pro‐life” constitutional amendments would invade a commonlaw “liberty” preserved to the people by the Ninth Amendment in 1791 (and what change in the law since 1791 did not infringe someone's liberty?) and that the amendment would be a legislation of morality (what of the abolition of slavery, for example?). After all, a constitutional amendment's very purpose is to change the Constitution. This failure of the “pro‐choice” groups to articulate defensible principles has resulted in defection from the cause. It certainly contributes to vulnerability to the assault of the “pro‐life” groups. On the other hand, the “pro‐life” arguments at least. deal with the true issues : What is the essential nature of the fetus? What is the right of society to be involved in any decision affecting such basic concerns? The “pro‐choice” groups so evade these issues that they prefer to talk of the “products of conception” and in some contexts, at least, to describe abortion as “menstrual regulation.” But the “pro‐life” arguments do not reflect a politically viable view. These people seem peculiarly convinced that an almost total prohibition of abortion can collect a two‐thirds majority of Congress and majorities of the legislatures of 38 states in the face of more than 30 states having ratified the Equal Rights Amendment. Even though there is no logically necessary opposition between these two moralities, certainly there is an irremedial political antipathy that assures that at least 13 states will hold out on the amendment the “pro‐life” people want, even assuming it could get that far. And anything short of an amendment is a dubious venture given the continuing strong support of choice in the courts. Certainly this would seem to be the time for seriously concerned people who neither accept that abortion is a purely private concern of the mother, nor that abortion should never be permitted, to speak out and to articulate where the social interest in the fetus (shall we say “persenhood”?) begins, and to articulate what, if any, grounds are sufficient to justify abortion after that point is reached. The answer to both of these questions is simply not self‐evident. Who is a person is a moral, not a scientific, judgment, but if only the “pro‐life” people talk about this question we very easily lose sight of other possible ways of resolving the question: for example, the presence of a vital human brain — the same test that seems to be gaining acceptance for the end of personhood. As medical science gives us ever greater capability for keeping people “alive” we will confront increasingly difficult questions about whether a person should be kept alive. If my reading of the current trend of opinion is correct, it is also time for the two extremes in the debate to being to reconsider their positions. The “pro‐choice” groups must begin to address the questions they have sought so strenuously to avoid facing. The “pro‐life” groups must begin to ask themselves what is the best they really can expect to achieve. The distortions of the political processes that single‐issue politics create are well known, and this issue above all others creates those distortions. Unless we are to accept these distortions indefinitely, regardless of what the extremes do, it is time for the rest of us to be heard. Joseph W.

The Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/16/archives/the-nation-in-summary-connally-passes-up-matching-funds-for-a-free.html,"John B. Connally contends that the combination of election process and journalistic priorities gives incumbent politicians the edge in Presidential campaigns, and events last week supported his view. While President Carter (and by association Senator Kennedy) dominated the news first because of Iran and then because of an uproar over women's issues, Mr. Connally gained notice chiefly by passing up Federal campaign aid for the primary elections. He said the strings attached to it would prevent his making a splash in the one way open to him — big spending in strategic places. Mr. Connally undoubtedly wished that someone else had taken the step first, given his “high roller” reputation and the implication that a $16.8 million limit is too low. But he trails the Republican leader in the polls, Ronald Reagan, by 2‐1. Unable to buy TV time because the networks don't yet want to sell it, and lacking Mr. Reagan's wide recognition, he has concluded he must buy attention in the early primaries. The state‐by‐state limits for Federally aided candidates, about $280,000 in New Hampshire and $1.35 million in Florida, are not the Texan's idea of big bucks. It is not easy, of course, to feel sorry for a man who has raised $8 million and who is not exactly ignored by the press. But Mr. Connally is not the only one to question whether the postWatergate campaign laws are all for the good. Several candidates have complained lately that the $1,000‐perperson contribution limit (which Mr. Connally must in any case abide by, in addition to Federal reporting requirements) is unrealistic in light of inflation. Mr. Reagan, who accepted matching funds for his 1976 campaign, last week called for repeal of political contribution and spending limits, saying they infringed “on the right of the individual to do what he wants to do on behalf of his political views.” One thing that Mr. Reagan's managers have decided they don't want him to do is run in first Republican primary (in Puerto Rico Feb. 17). They don't want to run their man where they're sure the results will be noticed, and where they can expect to win. Pushing the Panic Button on Chrysler The big question on the Chrysler bail‐out plan slowly wending its uphill way through Congress is now not whether it will be too little, but whether it will be too late. Last week, after disclosures that the country's third largest auto maker will lose $50 million more than anticipated this year, and $27 million more than expected next, Vice President Mondale and the company announced that Chrysler will run out of cash by mid‐January — even if Federal loan guarantees are approved before Congress goes home for Christmas. Both House and Senate aid bills would require all parties with a stake in Chrylser's future, from banks to dealers to auto workers, to pitch in. Mr. Mondale called for their contributions now. Company chairman Lee A. Iacocca blamed “current softness” in the car market for the need for tideover cash. In December, Chrysler's sales were down 14.3 percent from the same period a year ago. Ford and General Motors dropped 40.7 and 18.7 percent respectively. New Abortion Knot May Tie Up States If the House and Senate had any chance of reaching agreement this year on Federal funding of abortions — and they probably didn't — it grew slimmer last week when the House passed an amendment expressly telling states that they need not pay for abortions. That seems certain to tie up the child health‐care bill to which it is attached, and other business, because of Senate objections. The change, proposed by Maryland Republican Robert E. Bauman, in effect closes a loophole left by the Hyde amendment, the disputed provision in current law that forbids use of Federal Medicaid money for abortions unless a mother's life is endangered. Judges in some states have ruled that the Hyde amendment applied only to a section of Medicaid law dealing with abortions — not to the entire law, which says that states must finance “medically necessary” services. Thus, those states have been required to pay for “medically necessary” abortions. The Bauman amendment stipulates that nothing in the law “shall be construed to require any state funds to be used to pay for any abortion.” Passage puts that much more distance between the House and the relatively liberal Senate. This fall, with the Government running out of cash because disputed abortion measures held up money bills, the two branches reached an interim agreement to permit Medicaid abortion funding in cases involving rape, incest or endangerment of a mother's life. In New Jersey, one of the states where judges had bypassed the Hyde amendment, the legislature sought last week to impose controls with a bill requiring women to sign consent forms and then wait at least 24 hours. Gov. Brendan Byrne, suggesting he thought the measure unconstitutional, said he would not sign it. Mrs. Feinstein Wins In San Francisco Dianne Feinstein, San Francisco's mayor by appointment since George Moscone, architect of California's liberal government coalition, was killed a year ago, last week became mayor by the ballot box. Mrs. Feinstein's victory in Tuesday's runoff against Supervisor Harvey Kopp was testimony both to a revitalized campaign and to the increasingly cohesive political power of the city's homosexual community. After running only 2 percentage points ahead of Mr. Kopp in a six‐way primary, and even with him in the opinion polls, she took 54 percent on Tuesday, apparently largely because of her endorsement by David Scott, a homosexual activist who had placed third in November. Ahead now is the issue Mr. Kopp had made his key campaign attack: the city's shaky finances. A deficit of at least $117 million is projected for the next fiscal year. New Ethics Charges For Congressman January 1979 may have looked bad for Charles H. Wilson. January 1980 looks worse. In the course of the special inquiry that led to a House reprimand 11 months ago for not reporting a gift from the South Korean master lobbyist Tongsun Park, enough questions about the nine‐term California Democrat's financial dealings were raised to warrant a House ethics committee investigation. That panel last week formally accused him 15 counts of financial misconduct. The charges include accepting cash gifts of $15,500 from someone who had a direct interest in legislation before Congress, converting nearly $29,000 in campaign contributions to personal use, payroll padding and accepting kickbacks, and perjury. Mr. Wilson has denied the charges, “categorically and vigorously.” The next step is a public hearing before the committee, which seems about to have the time available. Daniel J. Flood, due to appear last week to defend himself against charges that he took $60,000 in bribes, did not. The panel rejected a pyschiatrist's testimony that an organic brain disorder meant the 69‐year‐old Pennsylvania Democrat was incompetent, but postponed the hearing because Mr. Flood is in hospital. The legislators won't return from Christmas holiday until Jan. 22; Mr. Flood is retiring Jan 31. Mine Union Votes For a War Chest In their 60‐year history, the United Mine Workers have provided the labor movement with much of its drama from John L. Lewis's defiance of Federal troops in the 30's, to contract murders and revolt under W.A. (Tony) Boyle in the 60's and early 70's and dissension and near‐bankruptcy with former reformer Arnold R. Miller. Last week, Sam Church Jr. — who assumed the union's presidency on Nov. 16 when Mr. Miller, in increasing ill health, resigned — set his agenda for reviving the 260,000‐member organization that digs half the nation's coal. The 1,270 delegates at the U.M.W's 48th constitutional convention approved establishment of a multimillion‐dollar selective strike fund, to be paid for by $25‐a‐week assessments on working miners. The target is the Consolidated Coal Company, which withdrew in May from the Bituminous Coal Operators Association, for three decades big coal's bargaining unit. That raised fears that separate negotiations would make a national contract impossible, and the U.M.W. regards such a pact as vital in its effort to organize the mostly nonunion Western mines, from which more and more of the nation's coal will be coming.

Letters,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/16/archives/letters-moscows-ironic-stance-on-iran.html,"It is time the U.S. Government took strong measures to resolve the Iranian crisis. We ought to round up our timid friends to support us visibly in this confrontation, which is also theirs, and we ought to warn our adversaries that any meddling in this affair on the wrong side will cost them dearly. We could begin, for example, by issuing a strong demarche to the Soviet Government. To the Editor: Indeed, the Soviet Government showed exceptional insolence when denouncing America for harboring the criminal Shah. After all, for 60 years the Communist rulers of Russia have obliterated the distinction between the public treasury and funds they can dispose of freely, without accounting to anyone. Those few billions of dollars the Shah's family is supposed to have skimmed off the Iranian people are a mere pittance compared with the riches, produced by the Russian people, that the Communist Party bosses squandered since the October Revolution. And as the leadership turnover in the Soviet Union is rather slow, the present rulers are responsible for, more or less, 30 years of this economic exploitation. The brutal repressiveness of the Shah's regime — though it is of course no mitigating circumstance for the record left behind by the deposed Iranian ruler — also resembles an innocent tale when compared with the criminal record of the present rulers of Russia. Let us not forget that most of them, Kosygin and Brezhnev included, came to positions of power in the 1930's, during the zenith of Stalin's terror, as Stalin's henchmen. In view of this horrible record and the accumulating evidence that people — whether in Uganda, in Iran or in Nicaragua — ultimately get rid of intolerable despotisms, we should warn the Soviet Union that when the people of the U.S.S.R. finally throw off the yoke imposed on them during the October Revolution, the Soviet leaders will be denied political asylum in the United States. To make sure that Ambassador Dobrynin will forcefully carry the message to his employers, perhaps we ought to make all Central Committee members ineligible for asylum in this country. As the dean of the diplomatic corps (ever since Somoza's ambassador lost his job in Washington), Ambassador Dobrynin has grown accustomed to the amenities of life in a bourgeois democracy. I am sure he will argue our case eloquently before his fellow Central Committee members. (Asst. Prof.) JAN T. GROSS Dept. of Sociology, Yale University New Haven, Dec. 10, 1979 Time to Doff the American Hair Shirt To the Editor: In response to Thomas Hilton's Nov. 25 letter, I agree that it is indeed ironic that American outrage should be stimulated by the 1979 seizure of Americans by Iranians and not by the 1953 overthrow of the Iranian Government by the American intelligence apparatus. However, I suggest that this irony is at least tempered, if not wholly mitigated, by the very factors (Vietnam, Watergate, etc.) that Mr. Hilton reports as having fueled his outrage. It is intrinsically unfair to justify present violence (as distinct from accepted modes of political action) on the basis of past errors of judgment, and I submit that if such a precept were made the basis of diplomatic response all the nations on earth would quickly find themselves in a sort of global “Hatfields and McCoys” situation. It is immaterial to me whether Mr. Hilton continues to wear the hair shirt of knee‐jerk liberalism; I have learned from experience, and have taken mine off. ROBERT LINDERMAN Allston, Mass., Dec. 10, 1979 To the Editor: Gordon Haskell, president of the Association for Union Democracy, says “the list of men and women who are trying to democratize and reform their unions could fill pages” [letter Dec. 9]. He cites Edward Sadlowski, who “ran a determined campaign to elect a Steelworkers reform slate.” Mr. Sadlowski did indeed offer himself to the U.S.W.A. membership in a democratic election. He lost. What kind of “democracy” does Mr. Haskell want? (Assoc. Prof.) ROY GODSON Director, International Labor Program Georgetown University Washington, Dec. 10, 1979 Pro‐Life, Pro‐Death To the Editor: Paul Hecht (letter Dec. 5) seems to think that opponents of abortion cannot logically or humanely support capital punishment. Destroying an innocent and helpless life, solely because one or more of its sponsors find it inconvenient, is not the same thing as providing society its one sure protection against those whose conscious actions threaten us all. WILLIAM V. KENNEDY Mechanicsburg, Pa., Dec. 6, 1979 Casualty of the SALT Debate To the Editor: About a month ago, Harry H. Almond Jr., a senior career attorney in the Department of Defense, was fired for supplying unclassified information relating to the SALT treaty, including his own legal evaluation on some technical language, to retired Lieut. Gen. Edward J. Rowny, a well‐respected expert who is opposed to ratification of the SALT treaty. I am not an expert on the matters at issue in the SALT negotiations and take no substantive position in the current public discussions, but the Administration's apparent attempt to inhibit the dissemination of the unclassified data on the basis of which the true debate can take place seems deplorable. Mr. Almond's action appears not to have been inconsistent with Administration policy on the substance of the SALT treaty, whatever his private views may be, and General Rowny could have got all the data he sought by petition under the Freedom of Information Act. The firing of Mr. Almond thus seems an effort to apply adversary and partisan tactics to a national discussion in which the whole national interest should be evaluated by all concerned in the light of the best information available. Moreover, in principle the close managing of information and the plac The Times welcomes letters from readers. Letters for publication must include the writer's name, address and telephone number. Because of the large volume of mail received, we re- gret that we are unable to acknowl- edge or to return unpublished letters. ing of unnecessary impediments in the path of those seeking public information is inconsistent with the national policy set out in the Freedom of Information Act. It also seems inconsistent with the public posture of a President who has asked us to trust him. It is hoped that the officials responsible for firing Mr. Almond will be reprimanded and that all officials of the executive branch will be reminded of their overriding responsibilities to carry out national policy, including information policy, regardless of the temptation of overzealous advocates to win policy battles, like that over the SALT treaty, by an improper stress on futile and petty adversary tactics. ALFRED P. RUBIN Professor of International Law Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy Medford, Mass., Dec. 7, 1979 The Concorde 16 To the Editor: On Dec. 8 you told of the near‐collision of an Air France Concorde, carrying 16 passengers and 9 crew to Paris, and an Air Force fighter squadron 28,000 feet over the Atlantic. Question No. 1: How could this happen? Question No. 2: Was this trio necessary? ALFRED GESCHEIDT New York, Dec. 8, 1979 Burdens the C.P.I. Doesn't Weigh To the Editor: Your recent editorial, “We're Better Off Than We Think” makes some excellent points. It is unfortunate therefore, that it emphasizes a current misconception about the overestimation of inflation by the Consumer Price Index. The Consumer Price Index does not assume that everyone buys a house every month. It does assume, as your editorial correctly states, that everyone buys housing every month. This means simply that housing costs rise any month along with current prices of new and used homes, rents and mortgage rates. If we are asking what is the purchasing power of the consumer's income flow, this is the correct way to make the computation. It is true, of course, that for many people housing costs do not change as does the cost of newly acquired housing. If, for example, the consumer has bought a house many years ago, his housing cost is fixed in nominal terms although inflation may be raising housing costs all around him. Indeed, he can pay off his mortgage in “cheap” dollars, or, if he were to sell his house, he could make a sizable gain, though it would go to pay for his next house. The point is that the Consumer Price Index does not deal with the impact of inflation on consumer assets or debts. That would be a worthwhile investigation. If it were carried out, it would show that some people gain and others lose. Those who purchased houses and acquired mortgages years ago are gainers. Those who accumulated their assets in savings and loan accounts or government bonds are losers. One of the reasons people are unhappy about inflation is that it not only has eroded what we normally see as assets fixed in nominal terms — bank balances and bonds, as well as equity values to everyone's surprise — but also has greatly eroded their pension assets. As we get older, many of us look forward to greatly reduced real asset positions and to declining retirement living standards. “Destroying the village to save it is not economic wisdom.” I agree. But we will not achieve the policy consensus we so badly need by pretending the problem is largely a money illusion. F. GERARD ADAMS Professor of Economics and Finance University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia, Dec. 7, 1979 A New Breed Of Assassins To the Editor: The recent assassination of the Shah's nephew in Paris, the claim of an Iranian militant leader that his group is responsible and his avowal that there is a death list for further action call into focus certain aspects of Iranian history which make the recent events in the area more comprehensible. The very word “assassin” is historically (and etymologically) of PersianSyrian origin (for Persia, read Iran; for Syria, Iraq). The Order of the Assassins was first called to the attention of Europeans by the famous medieval traveler Marco Polo. The Crusaders also came in contact with them. In the 11th, I2th and I3th centuries a subdivision of the Shiites, a militant minority in Islam, were the Ismailites, and a branch of the latter were the Assassins. The order was first led by Hassan Sabbah, popularly known as the Old Man of the Mountain. From 1090 to 1091 his headquarters were in the mountain fortress of Alamut, 70 miles northwest of Teheran. The order represented an extreme approach to the earlier (seventh‐century) problem of Islamic succession the issue that had split off a reactionary minority, the Shiites, from the more moderate, democratic and orthodox Sunnites. These two are still the major divisions of contemporary Islam, with the Shiites predominant in Iran. The Order of the Assassins terrorized the Moslem world by its special political method — assassination, meticulously planned and fearlessly carried out. The specialists were trained killers knowns as “fedais,'the faithful (compare the present‐day Arabic “fedayeen”). They were reputedly intoxicated by the opiate hashish (hence the name “hashishin” or, in English, “assassin”). In preparation for their homicidal acts, they were indoctrinated to believe that the reward for their services was, by analogy with the euphoric state of hashish intoxications, an assured place in Paradise with all the sensuous perquisites of the immortal condition. Though a small sect, they were greatly feared because of their devious, unpredictable and fanatical activities. They were finally subdued between 1256 (in Persia) and 1272 (in Syria), but underground remnants were believed to persist. History does not, strictly speaking, repeat itself, but unsolved problems and regionally familiar modes of solution persist and recur. Thus history monitors destiny. It is, therefore, instructive that the Order of Assassins mainly terrorized the Moslem world, and Islam itself overcame the Assassins. In that historical precedent may lie the chief, slim hope of the American hostages as well as the optimal alternative for the United States and for the West in general. However, the “manifest destiny” of Russia with its everwidening embrace will also bear watching. SAUL ROSENZWEIG St. Louis, Dec.8, 1979"
The Women Talk and the Candidates Listen Hard,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/16/archives/the-women-talk-and-the-candidates-listen-hard-political-spectrum-is.html,"WASHINGTON — Laura Murphy is a lobbyist for the American Civil Liberties Union, and earlier this month she was invited to hear a speech by Senator Edward M. Kennedy. As she was waiting for it to begin, Miss Murphy said that she was far more concerned about “issues” than about “sex appeal.” “Women are a majority of the voting population,” she noted, “and we are more of a thinking constituency now than we've ever been.” They are also a more crucial constituency. As the Presidential campaign accelerates, women are emerging as one of the most articulate and soughtafter interest groups in the electorate. By party rule, 50 percent of the delegates to the Democratic nominating convention next summer must be women. The Republicans have promised to aim for similar representation. Accordingly, no candidate can be nominated without strong support from women. The battle for this critical constituency broke into the open last week when the political action committee of the National Organization for Women, one of the largest feminist groups, voted not to endorse President Carter for re‐election regardless of who runs against him. They said he had failed to throw the full power of his office behind the drive for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, and had opposed Medicaid financing for abortions. Political Spectrum Is Wide Women, like most voting blocs, cut across the political spectrum, and do not necessarily follow particular leaders or organizations. Indeed, leaders of other feminist groups said that although they too were disappointed in Mr. Carter, it was politically unwise and premature to dump him now. Nevertheless, Mr. Carter was stung. On Thursday, he pointedly excluded the National Organization for Women from a previously scheduled White House conference that had been requested, ironically, by NOW president Eleanor C. Smeal. She ended up picketing the meeting with other members of her organization, while women on the inside were getting renewed assurances of the President's commitment to their cause. In the past, he has said the Equal Rights Amendment was a good thing. Last week, one participant reported afterward, he said he considered it to be “a politically attractive issue.” In less noticed ways, Republican candidates are also wooing the women's vote. George Bush, for instance, has hired a well‐respected professional, Susan Morrison, as his press chief. John B. Connally and Ronald Reagan have made big pitches to the women's groups that oppose the Equal Rights Amendment and freer abortion. But most of the attention is focused on the battle between Mr. Carter and Mr. Kennedy for the Democratic nomination. That battle is being fought on two fronts, public issues and personal attitudes, and many women, says Boston columnist Ellen Goodman, are “schizophrenic” about it. “Carter's not great on women's issues but he's made some tremendous appointments,” said Pam Fleischaker, an official of the Women's Campaign Fund. “Kennedy's the opposite. He speaks on the issues with great compassion, but he still doesn't believe that women can organize a district in Iowa as well as a man.” Mr. Carter supports the Equal Rights Amendment, but many feminists feel that he has not used enough political capital to promote it. Three states are still needed for ratification, the same number as when Mr. Carter took office. Senator Kennedy, sensing a Carter weakness, says the E.R.A would be a “principal moral issue” in his administration. Both candidates oppose abortion personally, but Mr. Kennedy has voted in favor of Federal funding for poor women seeking to end pregnancies. While this has won praise from feminists, the Senator's campaign appearances often attract women demonstrators who oppose abortion. Beyond these two touchstone issues, there is a growing feeling among feminists that they should concentrate on the issue that affects every woman's life every day — the economy. Since the average female makes only 60 percent of a male's income, the argument goes, inflation hits women harder; 63 percent of the poor people in this country are women, many of them elderly and isolated widows. In recent speeches, Senator Kennedy has impressed feminists by calling for reform of pension laws, enforcement of antidiscrimination statutes and changes in Social Security provisions that harm women. Mr. Carter often strikes similar themes but more softly, because of his expressed concern for balancing the Federal budget. Accordingly, while the President might lose some liberal votes, he picks up support from women who consider fiscal responsibility a top issue. On appointments, Mr. Carter has a clear advantage. Two of his chief political advisers, Anne Wexler and Sarah Weddington, are active feminists; the Weddington office recently distributed a poster showing 98 top female appointments in the Carter Administration, including three of the six women Cabinet officers in the nation's history, as well as 19 of the 23 female Federal judges. Senator Kennedy's Capitol Hill office, on the other hand, has long been known as a male preserve. “He insulates himself from professional women,” asserted Ellen Berman, a consumer advocate. “He has to prove himself.” The Senator has hired women for his campaign staff, including Joanne Howes, his deputy campaign manager; Martha Angle, a deputy press secretary; and Susan Estrich, an issues coordinator. “There's no question that I was hired because Senator Kennedy wanted to send a signal,” said Miss Howes. “We want to get women to vote for Senator Kennedy; it's as simple as that.” Personal Reactions Matter More difficult than keeping score on such issues, however, is gauging women's personal reactions to the candidates. President Carter counts heavily on his wife's advice and they apparently have a close, stable marriage. Senator Kennedy has Chappaquiddick. And he and his wife, Joan, have lived apart for the last two years while she was fighting alcoholism. The difference is one that women, particularly, seem to take note of, and Mr. Kennedy's success in seeking the female vote might well be influenced by how he assuages the sort of doubt voiced by Connie Knox, an office worker in Des Moines. “If he can't manage his own home,” Miss Knox asked during a recent Kennedy campaign swing through Iowa, “how will he manage the country?”"
Ideas &Trends,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/16/archives/ideas-trends-a-70-million-ghost-rider-in-the-skies-when-do-doctors.html,"It's Sunday. Do you know where your communications satellite is? The RCA Corporation has been looking for theirs since Monday, when it vanished after a simple orbital adjustment. But RCA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the North American Air Defense Command and other interested parties do not know where to find it. And with its radio transmitter mysteriously dead, the satellite isn't helping. Satcom III isn't likely to fall, company spokesmen say, unless its present orbit, whatever that is, dips into Earth's atmosphere. In that event, the satellite would burn up. A Satcom III loss would cost RCA over $50 million, were it not insured by Lloyd's, in London, for $70 million —the price of the launch, the craft and the communications business it would have carried. It may cost cable networks supplying that business millions, since they had reserved transmission time on the craft's 24 channels and, in some cases, invested in staff and television program purchases. Designed to send television programs from their sources to cable‐and pay‐television systems, Satcom III was to be leased to subscribers for $800 thousand to $1.2 million a year. Some customers, said RCA, can be shifted to other communications satellites, including Satcom I, in orbit since 1975 but already congested. Others must await the launch of Satcom IV, now planned for June, 1981. A spare satellite, to have been kept in reserve, will become the new Satcom IV with launching set for October 1981. Another spare will also be built. Satcom II, dedicated to telephone and data traffic to Alaska, may also be cleared for cable traffic. The hide‐and‐seek game began when RCA flight controllers commanded the satellite to fire a small motor putting the $20 million craft into permanent, stationary orbit over the Equator. The engine fired. There was the expected radio blackout because of interference from the rocket's exhaust plume. But since then, silence. When Do Doctors Break Confidence? Ewa Berwid lived in fear that her former husband, Adam, a patient in a mental hospital, one day would kill her. On Dec. 6, the second anniversary of her divorce, as a police emergency operator listened in horror, Ewa Berwid screamed “I'm dying!” Mr. Berwid surrendered to police, having kept an all‐night vigil by her body. Beyond the immediate tragedy, the public and the medical profession last week were embroiled in a debate over the inability of psychiatrists to predict the “dangerousness” of their patients. Legal and disciplinary actions were taken against two psychiatrists at Pilgrim State Hospital who released Mr. Berwid on a six‐hour “honor” pass just hours before the murder. Dr. Irving J. Blumenthal, the attending physician, and Dr. Tsu‐Teng Loo, the unit chief, were accused of poor medical judgment and not following hospital procedure, including peer review, in allowing their patient to leave hospital grounds, unaccompanied, on his first furlough. Mr. Berwid had previously threatened his former wife, although Dr. Blumenthal claimed that for eight months, “Mr. Berwid was a model patient.” State mental health authorities began proceedings last week to dismiss the psychiatrists. The Nassau County District Attorney's Office is investigating possible criminal charges and is also drafting a proposal for a state law forcing psychiatrists to notify the District Attorney, the courts and the police whenever potentially dangerous patients are furloughed. Precedent for such action was set in 1979 in California when the state Supreme Court ruled that doctors who believe a patient intends to hurt or kill someone must notify the potential victim, his relatives, friends or the authorities. The decision involved a men tal patient who threatened to kill his girlfriend, and did. “Psychiatrists can predict dangerousness about as well as the corner butcher,” says Dr. Stanley Portnow, forensic psychiatrist and associate professor at New York University Medical School. As do other psychiatrists, Dr. Portnow questions legal definitions of a “potentially dangerous” patient, and the circumstances under which psychiatrists should break confidentiality. A Gloomy View On World Hunger “At least one out of every eight people on earth is still afflicted by some form of malnutrition” and the situation is going to get worse. So said the preliminary report of President Carter's Commission on World Hunger, delivered last week. Mr. Carter agreed with the commission's assessment. The United States should do more to aid the long‐range economic development of the poor nations, he said; it had been using foreign aid too much as an instrument of short‐term political interests. But Mr. Carter did not address the question of doubling America's economic aid grants, from $7 billion to $14 billion. The commission said it was possible to feed the world's hungry with current agricultural technology and the abundant production of the United States and other large food producers, but that a long‐term solution depended on increasing the ability of the poor countries to feed themselves, or to sell enough of their own goods to buy food. For now, the world's worst food shortages appear to be in Cambodia and Thailand, where hundreds of thousands are undernourished and may well die, and in Latin America, where, according to studies prepared for the United Nations, 35 million children under 6 years of age are chronically undernourished and a million die each year before the age of 4. Yes to Nobel Prize, And No to Abortion Prize Day came in Oslo and Stockholm last week. The 10 science and literature winners gathered in Stockholm for the Nobel speeches and medals, while in Oslo the Nobel Peace Prize was duly delivered to Mother Teresa, founder and head of the Missionaries of Charity in Calcutta. Mother Teresa accepted the $192,000 prize in the name of the poor, the sick and the unwanted children. She said she would use the money, along with the $70,000 Norwegian People's Prize, to build homes for lepers to be run by her wordldwide organization, which operates 158 branch houses in 31 countries, including one in the Bronx. Although Mother Teresa usually avoids controversy, she used the occasion in Oslo to express her longstanding opposition to abortion. “To me the nations with legalized abortion are the poorest nations,” she said. “The greatest destroyer of peace today is the crime against the unborn child.” Belgian Theologian Called to Vatican The Holy Office of the Inquisition sounded scarier. Its successor, the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, last week began its inquiry in Rome into the writings and beliefs of the Rev. Edward Schillebeeckx, the Dominican priest who is a theological adviser to the Dutch hierarchy. No theologian of comparable stature has appeared before the congregation since the Second Vatican Council (1962‐65) and the inquiry is being watched closely to see how much freedom Pope John Paul II intends to allow theologians. Father Schillebeeckx appeared before a four‐member panel of the congregation in what some “liberal” members of the clergy called a “heresy trial.” The Vatican broke its previous silence on the subject to deny that the body constituted a court or could make any decisions. They just want Father Schillebeeckx to clarify his views, the Vatican said. One member of the panel, the Jesuit theologian Jean Galot, recently said that Father Schillebeeckx and other modern theologians, “in trying to be more accessible to contemporary man,” put at risk basic tenets of the Catholic faith, decided forever in principle in the Fourth Century — above all the divinity of Christ and his equality, identity and co‐eternity with God the Father. N.Y. Church Group Adjusts Time Warp The Council of Churches of the City of New York, which embraces 1,800 Protestant and Orthodox congregations, is supposed to provide a forum for ecumenical interchange among the churches and to give them a certain unity of voice on social issues. Recently, however, the council has declined in membership, influence and activity, and has been preoccupied with criticism, from inside and outside, of the Rev. Dr. Dan M. Potter, its executive director since 1955. A successor to Dr. Potter has now been chosen; he is the Rev. Robert L. Polk, a minister in the United Church of Christ and the first black to head the council. About 90 percent of the city's Protestants are black, and some black church leaders said Dr. Potter lacked sensitivity to their concerns. A further firestorm fell on him last year when it became known that he and his brother owned 16 slum buildings in Albany and that they had been cited for 68 housing violations. Dr. Potter said that he had bought the buildings to save them from further deterioration. ‘Benign’ Cat Plague Turns Virulent Marion Island, 1,200 miles south of Cape Town, is as long as Manhattan, but wider, and contains a South African weather station and, until recently, 6,000 (estimated) cats. No doubt Manhattan has more cats, but it can absorb them. Marion Island, a habitat for Antarctic sea birds, cannot, and South African authorities have begun a campaign to exterminate the cats —to the outrage of animal lovers. It all began in 1947, when the weather station imported five cats to deal with rats that were pestering it. Things took their course, and a professor of zoology at the University of Pretoria says the cats kill 600,000 birds, mainly petrels, each year and several species are endangered. South Africa's solution was to fly to the island, by helicopter, 100 cats infected with feline enteritis (also called panleukopenia), a highly contagious and usually fatal disease. Dr. Michael Levine, chairman of the South African Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, called the tactic “cruel and inhumane.” Meanwhile the cat population has already been halved, South African authorities say. They defend the method as benign because the virus affects no other creatures. (More Ideas & Trends, Page 20. ) Margot Slade and Tom Ferrell"
The Justices and the Journalists,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/16/archives/the-justices-and-the-journalists-justices.html,"OF all writing in this society, the writing of courts — in particular, the Supreme Court — has the most immediate powers and consequences. Men go to jail or are released, great corporate structures are dissolved or left intact, laws are upheld or overturned, men regulate their future conduct on the basis of what judges write. Most writing, of course, as THE BRETHREN Inside the Supreme Court. By Bob Woodward and Scott Armstrong. Illustrated. 467 pp. New York: Simon and Schuster. $13.95. pares to De or to appear original, to tell something new. This is true in scholarship and art. It is especially true, almost by definition, of journalism, where what is old, self‐evident or well known is simply not the news. The writing of judges, however, aspires to just Renate Adler, a graduate of the Yale Law School, is the author of “Speedboat” and a writer‐reporter on the staff of The New Yorker. the opposite effect. Perhaps because of its unique powers, judicial writing rests very largely on citing precedents, on saying: What we say today is more or less what we have always said, or should have said; it's what our citizens have tacitly agreed; it's what the Constitution meant; it's obvious. Every Court decision clearly contains some new element, or there would be no need to make it; what creativity there is, however, goes mainly into saying why it ought to come as no surprise. When serious investigative reporters confront the Court, there is thus a profound clash of aspirations. It is compounded for Bob Woodward and Scott Armstrong, in “The Brethren: Inside the Supreme Court,” by another problem. The Court, more than any other public institution, explains itself, identifies its sources. A dictator can say: This is the law because I say it is. A journalist can say: These are the facts and I need not tell who told me so. The Court says: This is the law (as applied to facts ascertained in a public forum) and, under our system, we are obliged to tell you why. To attempt, as Woodward and Armstrong have done, to go behind the Court's explanations over a period of six terms (1969 to 1975), and to find insights, or even secrets, of any importance whatsoever is an enormously ambitious undertaking. There are intimations, as early as page one of their introduction, that the authors may not be ideally equipped for it. “And because its members are not subject to periodic reelection, but are appointed for life,” they write, “the Court is less disposed to allow its decision making to become public.” Now, however long you may study that sentence, and whether or not you are a lawyer, you will realize that the connection between its two facts (if they are facts, if there is a connection) cannot be “because.” If there were a connection, it would more logically be “although.” But there is no connection. And looked at more closely, the two facts linked by that “because” are not quite facts. It is true that all Federal judges are normally and constitutionally appointed. ‘for life”; the Constitution just happens to phrase it “during good Behavior.” This distinction might seem unimportant — were it not that the authors later devote pages to efforts made to impeach Justices Douglas and Fortas. There could have been no such efforts if Justices were so simply and unequivocally appointed not during good Behavior but “for life.” And, since the “decision making” of Justices is, in the most obvious sense, precisely what is public, the authors can be alluding only to the Justices' (and, till now, the clerks') reticence about what goes on in conference (where clerks are not present) or in chambers. What the authors promise, however, and not just in their subtitle, “Inside the Supreme Court,” is revelations per se, disclosure of secrets on a grand, even unprecedented scale. Their information, they claim, is “based on interviews with more than 200 people, including several Justices, more than 170 former law clerks, and several dozen former employees of the Court.” A question immediately suggests itself. The custom of protecting the identity of sources, in daily journalism at least, has become extremely widespread. (I happen to believe that, except when actual, identifiable harm would result, to the source or to some other worthy cause or person, that practice can be unprofessional, a serious impediment to journalism of all kinds. It makes stories almost impossible to verify. It suppresses a major element of almost every investigative story: Who wanted it known.) But even if the identity of sources ought, almost invariably, to be protected, is there any tradition of reporting which requires that their number be protected as well? “More than 200 people,” “several Justices,” “more than 170 law clerks,” “several dozen former employees.” Well, how many? Twohundred and one people or 299? Three Justices, or five? What in the name of Journalism would be compromised if we knew? By the next page, we learn that the authors had “filled eight file drawers with thousands of pages of documents from the chambers of 11 of the 12 Justices” who served in the period under investigation. Then there is an apotheosis: “In virtually every instance [of what, they do not say] we had at least one, usually two, and often three or four reliable sources in the chambers of each Justice.” (Italics added.) Apart from an occasion to smuggle that word “reliable” into what appears to be a quantitative statement, what can these vague enumerations mean? They mean that, at least as regards number, the authors prefer their own pointless secret (how many) and implications of massiveness to precise statements of simple fact. A related preference appears in more trivial contexts: “‘No way,’ Justice Rehnquist shot back, adding a mild obscenity for emphasis.” By this point in the book, page 395, the authors have attributed to one Justice or another almost every obscenity I know. Are the identities of even mild obscenities now to be protected? Eight Justices were allegedly in the room when Justice Rehnquist said whatever it was, so there can be no question of needing to protect a source. But again, the authors prefer a knowing‐sounding secret to a simple fact. Most of the facts in this book, however, are far from simple; I have not meant to imply that this is a light or even unimportant work. It is only that, in this first, extended confrontation at book length, outside an actual lawsuit — between the Court (with its secrets, whatever they are) and investigative journalists (with their secrets, such as they are), the Journalists' own technique seems unexamined, and often very far from sound. “The Brethren,” as it hap pens, contains no scandals; and, although the authors clearly do not know it, no revelations that would astonish any lawyer or other student of the Court. Nonlawyers, I think, will find the book extremely hard to read. Since early in this century, most American law students have been taught (in what is called the “case method”) by textbooks called “Cases and Materials”: essentially very heavy compilations of appellate decisions (in Contracts, Torts, Procedure, and so on) interspersed with some expository matter by the author/compiler, and even a few questions at the chapter ends. Whatever the pedagogic value of these textbooks, every law student would concede that they are among the world's most boring books. “The Brethren” is, in some ways: Woodward and Armstrong, “Cases and Materials on the Supreme Court.” The cases, however, are not appellate judgments, but journalists' (not lawyers') summaries; and the materials are meditations — and an odd form of gossip that the authors seem to regard as investigative scoops. The gossip most characteristically takes the form of a de Earl Warren and Warren E. Burger. clarative sentence about a frame of mind: “Burger was furious.” “Harlan was furious.” “Brennan was furious.” Innumerable paragraphs begin with the information that one Justice or another was “furious,” “delighted,” “upset,” “especially upset,” “exceedingly upset,” “happy,” “not happy,” “also unhappy,” “disturbed,” “worried,” “pleased,” “not pleased,” “both pleased and frightened,” “glad,” “troubled,” “tormented,” “elated,” “despondent,” “overjoyed,” “shocked,” “as usual more amused than shocked,” “once again enraged,” “crestfallen,” “flabbergasted,” and so forth. Not only do the Justices ride these gusts of mood and feeling; all the more, the clerks. My favorite piece of American judicial history may be the news (page 326) that “Marshall's clerks were miffed.” The book also chronicles less subjective states of mind: realizations, for example; also vows. “Burger vowed to himself that he would grasp the reins of power Immediately.” Since the authors admit that Chief Justice Burger refused all contact with them, it is hard to know how they can write this quite so categorically. Justice Burger may, of course, have confided his vow to someone else, who then anonymously passed on the information that Justice Burger said he, had vowed something to himself. But it is precisely the weakness of this kind of journalism that, because there is no way to check almost any of its assertions, the journalists themselves are sooner or later drawn into some piece of irresponsibility or idiocy; and one has to read every one of their assertions, from the most trivial to the most momentous, with the caveat “if true.” (Justice Burger “vows” again, 312 pages later, this time “to his clerks.” The content of that vow: “that he would hold his ground.”) As for realizations: “When Nixon was informed of the investigation, he realized that Fortes' actions were perhaps criminal and perhaps not.” In fairness to the authors, one ought to raise the possibility that the above sentence reflects editing by lawyers—not good lawyers, certainly not constitutional lawyers—but lawyers who did not think Justice Fortes a “public figure” within the meaning of New York Times v. Sullivan, and who also thought (rather incredibly) that a libel, if libel there was, would evapo rate with the addition of two “perhaps” and .one “not.” There arises, then, the question of “The Brethren” and the law — which the authors treat confidently, seriously and at length. In small things and in large, with surprising frequency, they get it wrong. They don't seem to kliow, for example, the difference between appeal and certiorari or even what an appeal is. This leads them to major misstatements in their first explanation of the steps by which the Court decides to take a case: “1. The decision to take the case requires that the Court note its jurisdiction or formally grant cert. Under the Court's procedures, the Justices have discretion in selecting which cases they will consider.” The second sentence is plain wrong. The Justices have such discretion only when the issue is whether to grant cert; they do not have that discretion when a case comes to them on appeal. The first sentence, of course, does not mention appeal. There are small matters: Justice Douglas, for example, confined to a hospital bed, asking another Justice to be his “best friend [authors' italics] and swear out a writ” to get him out. Now the ancient legal locution happens to be “next friend”; the only reason (apart from the knowingness implied by those italics) that this is not just a slip too inconsequential to mention is what it implies about the authors' ear for dialogue. In a journalistic enterprise that relies so heavily on a sort of telephone game (Justice, for example, who confides to clerk, who tells reporter) a demonstrably inaccurate ear may be a handicap. It casts doubt particularly on extended conversations that the authors reconstruct, unqualifiedly, in quotes. As it happens, the way the Justices treat one another's illnesses, aging, reluctant retirements, death is a genuinely moving subtext of the book. The authors, and especially the clerks — because another serious subtext is the patronizing, self‐infatuated trivialization, by recent clerks, of the relation of clerkship — have a tendency to reduce the Justices' concern with mortal fallibility to the news that Justice Douglas smelled, in conference, because he had become incontinent. There are also large, quite complicated mistakes of law, which should startle and confound lawyer and non‐lawyer alike. I'll mention just one, be fore returning to another sort of gossip, which, finally, constitutes the “Materials” of the book. “Moreover, Stewart felt trapped,” they write, “by a phrase Rehnquist had convinced him to add to a 1971 opinion (Roth v. Bd. of Regents). Though it had seemed harmless to Stewart at the time, the phrase said that due proress should be invoked only for rights specifically created by governments.” Roth v. Bd. of Regents came down in 1972, not 1971; but that is not the point. The point is that if Justice Stewart had ever written that “due process should be invoked only for rights specifically created by governments,” he would have abrogated the Constitution — letter, spirit and Preamble. Among the truths which the Framers held to be self‐evident, the reader will remember, was that certain, emphatically not governmentcreated rights — life, for instance, and liberty — are inalienable. If Justice Stewart had written a phrase to the effect that citizens could, without due process, be deprived of life or liberty, that would be news indeed. Of course, that is not what he wrote. What he wrote was that due process should not be invoked for property rights other than those created by government. That view is problematical, controversial and probably, in spirit, unconstitutional enough. But nothing like what the authors say. Their discussion of the abortion cases is also, for its length, remarkably askew and superficial; their summary of Alexander v. Holmes County (a wonderful case in which the Court reversed a decision of the heroic Fifth Circuit, to that lower court's eternal credit and surprise) shows they have not even a minimal understanding of civil‐rights litigation in the South. The reason they cannot address in any depth even the important questions of which they are aware lies in their unusual preoccupation with a very odd kind of gossip: who voted how and when, and whose vote changed; who thought what about whose earlier drafts; but, above all, who liked or disliked whom. One would have thought the matter of earlier drafts could have been disposed of in a second. No writer, least of all an investigative reporter working on a book, wants to be held accountable for his early drafts. But, “‘If an associate in my law firm had done this,’ Powell told a clerk [of Chief Justice Burger's draft in a busing case], ‘I'd fire him.’ ” “White thought Blackmun's drafts [in the abortion. cases] were dreadful.” “Stewart told his clerks that the Chief's initial draft of the decision [in the Nixon tapes case] would have got a grade of D in law school.” Hardly anyone, I think, would contend that even the final opinions of the Court very often reflect the work of nine, or even any, distinguished draftsmen. To the caveat “if true” about this sort of news, in short, one is inclined to add “So what?” But Woodward and Armstrong endlessly return to who thought what of drafts. Another subject that fascinates them is shifting votes. Now it must be obvious, on a moment's reflection, that it is desirable — even essential to the judicial process — that the Justices be able sometimes to persuade one another, to change their minds. The authors do have evidence in support of two old and interesting rumors. The first, that Chief Justice Burger often reserves (or repeatedly and perhaps disingenuously changes) his vote, in order to retain the prerogative of assigning a majority opinion, is not too serious; the result, most often, is only that he joins in a majority position more liberal than any he would have taken on his own. The second, that the Chief Justice has tried to alter certain traditions of the Court (to assign from the minority even when he is in the majority; or to permit rehearing of a case when no member of the deciding majority has voted to rehear), would strike lawyers as more disturbing. Except that, under protest from other Justices, these efforts failed. But more than drafts, more than vote changes, the authors are concerned with the popularity, within the Court, of Justices. Their villain is, beyond doubt, Chief Justice Burger. He is characterized, in terms attributed to other Justices, as “grossly inadequate,” “overbearing and offensive,” “tasteless,” “without substance or integrity,” “intellectually dishonest,” “abrasive,” “asinine,” a “blustery braggart,” and so on. Other Justices are also characterized in terms attributed to' their colleagues: Justice Marshall,. for instance, as “petulant”; Justice White as “not particularly likeable,” “an enigma” who cheats at basketball. But every Associate Justice, according to this book, has something disagreeable to say about the Chief Justice. This may or may not be true. If true (as everyone who has ever worked in an office with even a beloved boss will know), it may or may not have any meaning. But on page 323, in another apotheosis, there may be a kind of clue. “The Justices found themselves entering the clerks' longstanding debate: Was the Chief evil or stupid?” “The clerks' longstanding debate.” There have been countless other clues on this order: “The language remained Blackmun's; the more rigorous analysis was the work of the clerk.” “How, Powell asked his clerks, did Marshall turn out such a masterpiece so quickly? The clerks were frank. Marshall's clerk was first rate….” “The clerks were frank,” to the same effect, it seems, quite often. On page 279, this achieves an almost wonderful fatuity. Justice Rehnquist has allegedly brought to conference an issue of the National Lampoon, Which depicts all members of the Court in obscene postures: Justice Brennan, for instance, opening his robe in front of two little girls; Justice Blackmun sodomizing a kangaroo. Justice Brennan, the authors say, thought he alone was portrayed as innocent: “His clerks decided they owed it to him to explain ‘flashing.’ “ Justice Blackmun claimed not to know what he was supposed to be doing to the kangaroo: “The clerks drew straws to see who would tell him.” Oddly enough, and for reasons of which the authors seem to have no notion, this is the only “Materials” scoop they have: the fact that clerks spoke to them; the precise number who did; the apparent smugness and foolishness of what they said; and the fact that (although they clearly believed otherwise, else why speak to investigative reporters?) the clerks knew no important secrets at all. The origins of Supreme Court clerkship are recent — the turn of the century. Justices White, Rehnquist and Stevens are, in fact, the only former Supreme Court clerks to have become Justices. There used to be one clerk per Justice; even in the late years of the Warren Court, when there were two, the relation was close. A clerk was, for a year, an apprentice, son, research assistant, ghost‐writer, friend. His real importance to the Court, I think, if any, was, as a student recently graduated from law school, to bring the views of law faculties to the attention of Justices. Whatever it was, it was a unique and fine relation. Now, with the mushrooming of clerkships (four to each Justice), there is a possibility that they have become a bureaucracy like any other —with confidences to violate, surely; but with fewer secrets, because the Court explains itself, than others have to tell. The authors' “Materials” scoop, in other words, would have had to do with what has happened to clerks and the relation of clerkship. Their “Cases” scoop, for not unrelated reasons, would have had to do with Justice Rehnquist and his work. As clearly as Chief Justice Burger is their villain, Justice Rehnquist is very much their man. Their inquiry about how he came to be appointed, compared to their discussion of the appointment of other Justices, is remarkably uninquisitive. Here's how he is characterized, however, as a member of the Court: “jolly,” “jovial,” “sincere,” “thoughtful;” “remarkably unstuffy,” “good natured,” “aware of Burger's faults,” of “crisp intellect,” “diligence” and “friendliness toward clerks,” “hard not to like.” “Rehnquist and his clerks,” the authors typically write of him, “chuckled quite a bit.” It is true that they also quote other Justices to the effect that Justice Rehnquist is “slow even to correct an outright misstatement,” that he “misrepresented the legislative history,” “twisted the facts,” used “disingenuous scholarship,” made “misuse of precedents,” tried an “underhanded attempt to slip through a major policy shift.” But they seem unaware that these adverse characterizations, if true, are of an entirely different order from any others they have made. Even if the clerks did have a “longstanding debate” as to whether the Chief Justice, for instance, was “evil or stupid,” that debate, those adjectives, would have no legal or other substance. The Court, after all, is an ongoing body, committed to the Constitution and its own history. If the Burger Court has allowed certain critical rights to erode (the right, for example, in all criminal trials to a jury of 12 and to a unanimous verdict), it has also (in the first abortion decisions) made some of the most radical and humane judg ments in the history of the Court. Even Alexander v. Holmes County — in which the Brown v. Board of Education integration formula, “all deliberate speed,” was superseded altogether by “at once … now and hereafter” — was hardly ineloquent or unradical. These were, however, questions about which reasonable men, and honorable Justices, might differ. But Justices, whatever their views, are supposed to be committed, in the exercise of their profession, to straight facts and valid precedents in law. This has nothing to do with ideology. There should, there must, at all times, be conservatives on the Court. But if there were a Justice who did “twist facts,” “misrepresent … history,” “misuse precedents,” and so on — if there were a Justice somewhat unconcerned, not only with what is humane or just (matters, arguably, of rhetoric), but even with what is apposite — such a Justice would be fundamentally unserious. If there were a Justice who had few thoughts or even arguments, but only positions and strategies (like a teething Jesuit or a Talmudic scholar), such a Justice would represent not the judicial mind at all, but the legal mind at its most trivial and base — making, in the name of advocacy, arguments that it is precisely the business of the judiciary to cut through. It is possible that the Court has just such an unprecedented casuist in Justice Rehnquist — not a “constructionist” or even a “conservative” at all, except in caricature. It sometimes seems that if a genuine conservative, of real distinction, were ever on the Court, one would find Justice Rehnquist in dissent. The authors' partiality for the youngest Justice makes his influence on their book considerable as considerable in its way as (and analytically more important than) the influence of the clerks. Their error, for instance, about what Justice . Stewart wrote in Roth — no due process for non‐governmentcreated rights, instead of no due process for non‐governmentcreated property rights — originates, in all probability, with Justice Rehnquist, who (in consistently eliding liberty and property rights) gradually has been trying to obscure precisely the distinction Justice Stewart made. In Arnett v. Kennedy, which most lawyers would agree was his worst opinion (al though the authors cite two others as his “worst”), he further managed, by a characteristic piece of analysis, to deprive due process of any meaning as was noted by his colleagues, including Justices White and Powell, but not by the authors here. In their rapport with the youngest Justice, the authors miss the essence of just such attempts to “slip through a major policy shift.” If the book fails, in its legal analysis, in its efforts to find and disclose important secrets, as an account of the Court in any significant or coherent sense, why is it an important book at all? Because of who the authors are and the very extent of their ambition: “Inside the Supreme Court.” The relation between the press and the courts, in our society, is rarely devoid of interest. It is an important event in the history of both institutions when highly serious journalists approach the nation's highest Court. The trouble is, it turns out to be futile to approach the subject in this way. It is not unusual for people to misapprehend the nature of the institution and make more or less misguided approaches to Justices; Chief Justice Burger himself made at least one unjudicial approach, in the matter of the bombing of Cambodia, to Presi dent Nixon. (This story, however, is not the authors' scoop but Mr. Nixon's, in “RN.”) What does the failure mean? It means that certain techniques, well suited to investigation of breaking stories of a criminal nature, are entirely unsuited to extended, serious analysis in other contexts. The only scoop there could possibly be about an institution as public as the Supreme Court would be a revelation of crime or corruption (of which Woodward and Armstrong, at least, found none). It may be that an analytic mind and an integrating theme — an instinct for which facts have meaning, which are meaningless and which are not even facts — are more suitable than an investigative reporter's sheer persistence, and obsession with keeping (his own) and breaking (others') secrets, to pursuing certain kinds of stories. Most stories — apart from affairs of the military, of crime, and sometimes of the heart are not, after all, secrets as such. Anticipation of this book was high, in journalistic and in legal circles. The Court, with the possible exception of the relation of clerkship, survives — no more nor less public than it ever was. Investigative reporting, perhaps, might think again. ■"
Anguished Searc h to Cure Infertility,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/16/archives/anguished-search-to-cure-infertility-medical-advances-offer-new.html,"They arrive one by one at the back door; stealing through the night, afraid to be recognized by the neighbors. A woman answers and they enter, awkwardly taking their places on the brown corduroy couch, clutching their overcoats to their laps like armor. One lights a cigarette. Another twists the ends of her hair. These are not women to whom rap sessions come easily. Shame is a feeling they have learned to keep to themselves. But here they are: strangers to each other, they have come to this home in Great Neck, L. I., to share their most painful anguish, an intimacy they have disclosed to very few. Their need to speak is tangible. “It's the idea that you don't have the option,” a woman in an armchair says. “It hurts me. “It's that feeling of helplessness. I chose my husband. I chose where I want to live. But now I can't choose. I've lost control.” “The feeling of paralysis,” the woman with the cigarette says, “is terrible. I can't go on with my life because, in my heart of hearts, I think it will happen. I really do. I think if I just wait a little longer, the whole thing will blow over.” These women in their 20's alternate between nervous laughter and tears. Passing around a box of Kleenex, they speak of guilt, failure, disgrace and fleeting time. They feel cheated. They question their femininity and mourn the emptiness of their future. These women are incapable of having children. While much of the world worries about preventing unwanted births, millions of other people are struggling with the opposite problem: bearing the children they want. In this country alone, an estimated 10 million individual men and women between the ages of 18 and 40 experience difficulty either in conceiving a child or in carrying a pregnancy to term — a number that experts say is growing. Although there have always been couples unable to have children, today's life styles and mores have aggravated infertility to new proportions. The tendency for women to postpone childbearing into their 30's, when fertility generally decreases, the epidemic rise in venereal disease, as well as —ironically — current methods of birth control have all contributed to a sharp rise in infertility. Three decades ago, one out of 10 couples was believed to have difficulties bearing children; today, experts estimate, that figure is one out of six — an increase that reflects not only exacerbated physiological problems but also the greater willingness of infertile couples to seek medical help. “Infertility is a problem of modern society,” says Dr. Alvin F. Goldfarb, a Dena Kleiman is a reporter for The New York Times. Philadelphia gynecologist and obstetrician associated with the University of Pennsylvania, and president of the American Fertility Foundation, whose headquarters is in Birmingham, Ala. Some doctors contend that among the most important factors in the upswing in infertility has been the widespread use of the intrauterine device, the birth‐control pill and abortion. Pelvic infection is the leading cause of infertility in women because it can ravage the delicate anatomy of reproduction. It can result from any number of things, from a burst appendix to venereal disease, and it has also been linked in some instances to the IUD. The pill has been found to halt ovulation in certain women, particularly in those who have had ovulation difficulties or irregular menstrual periods in the past. Abortion, too, has been blamed for infection, and the forced opening of the cervix in later stages of unwanted pregnancy may make it harder to hold a future pregnancy that is desired. Infertility has emerged as a major concern in the fields of gynecology, urology and endocrinology as more couples than ever before seek medical assistance. Because of the current dearth of healthy infants available for adoption (this, too, partly a result of society's increased reliance on birth control), couples who in the past might have adopted children are pursuing medical treatment today. Others who would have shied away from the expense and inconvenience are buoyed by recent highly publicized advances in the field — most notably the birth in England last year of Louise Brown, the first so‐called testtube baby. There have been other major developments as well. With new drugs that induce ovulation, improved tools with which to examine directly a woman's reproductive organs, sophisticated new surgical techniques, and a better understanding of sperm production and what can disrupt it, specialists today are more optimistic and better equipped than ever before to assist couples. “The key word these days in fertility is ‘hope,’ “ says Dr. Sherwin A. Kaufman, a New York City gynecologist in charge of the infertility clinic at Lenox Hill Hospital. When he began his practice 30 years ago, Dr. Kaufman said, only 25 percent of the couples who sought help eventually conceived and had a child. Now he and other experts agree that between 50 and 70 percent of those who seek a specialist's help can expect to have their problem diagnosed and successfully treated. Still, even for couples who eventually succeed, the struggle to have a child is long, lonely and expensive. While others take the experience for granted, they must undergo lengthy, painful examinations, wrestling with feelings of guilt as they wait to learn what is “wrong,” who is “at fault.” Often there are no immediate answers, and tests must be repeated; the uncertainty continues. Bedrooms are transformed into laboratories complete with charts, thermometers, bottles and timetables. Intimacy evaporates from their lives as sexual relations are reduced to documentation for study. The quest for a child becomes an obsession. Vacations are postponed, employment opportunities rejected, business trips synchronized with doctors' appointments and ovulation schedules. Many couples say that if they only knew for certain that they could never have a child, they would give up and get on with their lives. But as long as there is one more doctor, one more possible remedy, even the most unlikely straw to clutch at, they continue, trapped in a seemingly endless cycle of expectation and disappointment. The psychological trauma can devastate individual selfesteem and erode even the most secure marriage. To deal with such stress, groups such as the one in Great Neck have been organized across the country. This particular one met at the home of Dr. Marilyn Varadi, a Long Island psychologist who for many years was herself unable to have a child. She is a member of a Boston‐based counseling organization for infertile couples known as Resolve that was begun in a living room six years ago and now has chapters in 24 cities. Unaware that there are such counseling groups, as well as physicians who specialize in infertility problems, many couples live alone with their ordeal, too ashamed or hurt to seek help. This is the story of three couples who were willing to share their experiences so that others will realize their situation is not unique. Deep inside Katie Berry's bedroom closet is a large wooden box stuffed with baby clothes and hand‐knit blankets. She never looks inside the box; she just opens it from time to time to add new things. By now the box is almost full. Mrs. Berry, who is 26 years old and lives with her husband, Edward, on the outskirts of Nyack, N. Y., has been trying to have a child for six years. When Mrs. Berry dropped out of college at the age of 20 to marry, she expected to have children right away. Her husband had just gotten started in his family's home‐heating business, and she decided she would postpone her own career until after she had been a mother. They did not practice birth control, and they purchased an elegant, three‐bedroom Tudor house in which they planned to raise their family. After three years of not becoming pregnant, Mrs. Berry decided to consult her local gynecologist, who told her to “go home and relax,” and that she was “too young to worry about having children.” Another doctor — also without formal expertise in infertility — offered what Mrs. Berry said were “insulting” charts about the logistics of sexual intercourse. It was yet a third doctor who finally agreed to conduct a routine examination. Like many couples, Edward and Katie Berry at first felt uneasy about undergoing these tests. While both were eager to learn what could be done to help them, they were also afraid to discover what was “wrong.” For both Mr. and Mrs. Berry, the ability to have a child was linked to their self‐images and sexual identities. When they first arrived at the doctor's office, Mr. Berry said, he found it “degrading” to masturbate in the bathroom to obtain a fresh sample of sperm. This is a routine part of any proper fertility examination. For, while infertility was once believed to be solely a woman's problem, it is now known that men are responsible in at least 40 percent of the cases. In another 20 percent of the instances, the wife and husband may both be responsible. After it was found that Mr. Berry's sperm count was within the normal range of more than 20 million healthy, mobile sperm per milliliter (one‐fifth of a teaspoon) of semen, Mrs. Berry underwent a series of examinations at various points during her menstrual cycle. Her doctor scraped the lining of her uterus with a long, thin, razorsharp tool to determine if she was ovulating properly, and, by analyzing the tissue specimen under a microscope, he decided that she was. This test, called an “endometrial biopsy,” can be extremely painful, and some doctors administer an anesthetic. Mrs. Berry said that she received no warning of the pain, nor any means to alleviate it. In another painful but necessary examination, by means of a narrow tube attached to a hose, the doctor filled Mrs. Berry's oviducts with pressurized carbon dioxide to determine whether they were properly open. Since Mrs. Berry felt a sharp pain in her shoulder during the test (an indication that the gas had passed through her tubes up into her pelvic cavity and diaphragm), he determined that there was no tubal blockage. Toward the middle of her menstrual cycle, Mrs. Berry's doctor performed a postcoital examination — sometimes the most awkward of these tests because a couple must coordinate intercourse with a physician's office hours. Several hours after relations, the doctor aspirated Mrs. Berry's cervix with a thin tool in order to determine whether a sufficient number of healthy sperm had successfully passed through her vaginal canal. They had, and the doctor found that Mrs. Berry's cervical mucus had the right consistency and acidity. There was no evidence of an allergic reaction that can kill sperm. Then, in an excruciating examination, Mrs. Berry's uterus was injected with dye and X‐rayed to see if it was structurally impaired. The doctor decided it was not. In addition, for almost a year, Mrs. Berry took her temperature every morning, noting when she and her husband had had intercourse the night before. Still, the doctor found “nothing wrong.” Convinced that her doctor was right and that “the problem would disappear,” Mrs. Berry repeatedly turned down opportunities for employment and educational advancement. But as more time elapsed, the strain increased. Alone at home while her husband was at work, Mrs. Berry began to wonder whether her husband thought any less of her as a woman, and whether sometimes he secretly regretted not having married someone else. “We always both assumed we would have them,” said Mrs. Berry. “We never really ever talked about the possibility of not having children.” It was a lonely time for both of them. Every time he passed a baseball field and saw a father playing catch with his son, Mr. Berry said, he felt pain. For Mrs. Berry, the anguish ran in tandem with her menstrual cycle. Every four weeks she would hope that “this is the month,” and then, as another period began, she would plunge again into despair. Her worst depression, however, occurred last summer, when her best friend had a baby: “It was as if she had gone a whole step beyond me and there was no way I could get to that point. She was a mother. She had joined the ranks. She wasn't just my friend Patty anymore. That's when it really hit me. I realized I tend to look at women in terms of mothers and nonmothers. Are you a mother? Yes. Oh. You're one of those. I'm not one of those. I'm a nonmother and, when it's not by choice, it's very painful.” Slowly, the Berrys began to confront their situation together and they grew closer than they had ever been. Like many other couples searching for answers, they became experts in the intricacies of infertility. They read extensively and kept up with the research. Armed with this knowledge, they decided last summer, after Mrs. Berry's deepest depression, to see a doctor in New York City. Until they took “the long drive to see a specialist,” Mrs. Berry said, they had refused in their own way to admit that the problem was real. Mr. and Mrs. Berry consulted the New York Fertility Research Foundation in Manhattan, which deals exclusively with infertility problems, and there Mrs. Berry learned she suffered from polycystic ovarian disease —her ovaries produced microscopic cysts instead of eggs. “Here was this doctor saying I have this disease,” Mrs. Berry recalled, “and we were elated. We came home and called our family. It was like someone had handed us a solution.” Mrs. Berry began receiving doses of clomiphene citrate (Clomid), an ovulation‐inducing drug considered one of the major breakthroughs in the treatment of infertility. These pills, taken orally from the fifth through the ninth day of the menstrual cycle, are designed to stimulate the pituitary gland to produce FSH and LH — two hormones that in turn trigger the ovaries to release eggs. The drug has been shown to induce ovulation in some 70 percent of the patients for whom it is prescribed, of whom an estimated 40 percent eventually conceive. Mrs. Berry, like many other patients with ovulation difficulties, was also given monthly injections of progesterone, a hormone normally released after ovulation that prepares the lining of the womb for the implantation of the fertilized egg. After three months, however, Mrs. Berry had not conceived. It became clear from her temperature charts that she had not begun to ovulate, and that a stronger drug would be needed. That drug is human menopausal gonadotropin (Pergonal), a powerful fertility drug, extracted from the urine of menopausal women, that is known to carry numerous risks, including multiple births. The Berrys had already decided that their treatment would stop at Pergonal, because they did not want to “tempt the fates.” Despite the poor prognosis, Mrs. Berry has decided to continue with an increased dose of Clomid. Mrs. Berry has begun taking courses in psychology at Fordham University, but only part time. She says that going to classes full time would be to acknowledge that she will never be a mother. The Berrys wait. On the second floor of their spacious home, theirs is the first bedroom to the right of the stairs. The other rooms are empty. The doors are always kept closed, and only rarely does either one of them go inside. An abandoned ironing board and easel are the only items in the “nursery.” The “guest room” is piled with storage and a collection of stuffed animals covered with dust. A gaily colored felt duck next to the bed still bears its price tag. There are times — especially now, when the downstairs fireplace is blazing — when the Berrys say they hear strange noises from those upstairs rooms, as if children were laughing or running down the hall. “Ghosts,” they call them. And when they hear them, they do not go upstairs. They put on the stereo. The new techniques for treating infertility are impressive even if they haven't yet given the Berrys the children they long for. The birth last year in England of a baby conceived in vitro is perhaps the most dramatic of these advances. It has given hope to tens of thousands of women unable to conceive because their Fallopian tubes are hopelessly damaged. The mother was 32‐year‐old Lesley Brown, who had tried unsuccessfully for nine years to have a child by her railwayworker husband. She finally was able to become pregnant and go through normal labor after an egg cell was removed from her ovaries, exposed to her husband's sperm in a laboratory petri dish, and allowed to grow briefly before it was implanted in her uterus. While there is no law in the United States prohibiting this procedure of in vitro fertilization, developed by Dr. Robert G. Edwards and Dr. Patrick C. Steptoe, it has yet to be put into use here. Last March, the Ethics Advisory Board of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare lifted a fouryear‐old ban on the method, but American doctors eager to begin its application have run into local opposition. Critics, decrying the method as an invasion of the reproductive process, warn of possible birth defects, dangerous implications for the future, and legal questions concerning parenthood, legitimacy and child support. Some fear that if the technique spreads, someday it will allow couples to choose the sex of their offspring and to adopt embryos — instead of children — when the prospective mother is unable to ovulate. Others envision with dread a time when a woman might be hired to house until birth an egg produced by someone else. Although in vitro fertilization currently has a success rate of less than 10 percent, it has been approved for research by the directors of the Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk, Va. Dr. Howard W. Jones and his wife, Dr. Georgeanna Seegar Jones, had planned to perform the procedure there late this year, but final preparations have been suspended pending hearings by local hospital authorities. Already, more than 2,500 women have signed up to be included in the program, and thousands more have made inquiries. In vitro fertilization is certainly dramatic, but it is only one of numerous significant advances in the field. Thanks to improved technology and a better understanding of infertility's causes, an estimated 90 percent of the couples who seek medical assistance now can at least expect to have the source of their difficulty properly diagnosed. This high rate is due in part to new instruments that enable a doctor to examine directly the ovaries, uterus and Fallopian tubes, which were previously hidden from sight. There is, for instance, the new hospital procedure known as laparoscopy, in which a thin, telescopic tool is inserted into the pelvic cavity through a small incision near the navel. Carbon dioxide is then blown through a needle into the incision so that the organs are separated from each other and a doctor can look for abnormalities. With this test, doctors have been able to detect subtle structural problems in the Fallopian tubes, as well as endometriosis — a common cause of infertility involving the presence of uterine lining (the endometrium) outside the walls of the womb. Laparoscopy is also used to remove an egg from the ovary for fertilization in vitro. In addition to Clomid and Pergonal, .. which assist in ovulation, another new drug, danazol (Danocrine), has been found effective for more than 70 percent of women suffering from endometriosis. It succeeds by suppressing the production of estrogen and progesterone, producing a “postmenopausal” state which, if prolonged for six months, reduces the excess endometrial lining. Endometriosis, which is more common among older women, may also be treated with pills that have the opposite effect: simulating a pregnancy. When the condition is severe, doctors operate to remove the unwanted tissue. Newly synthesized drugs designed to stimulate hormones have offered new hope to many infertile men, too. But the main strides here have been surgical. Men who suffer from varicocele — varicose veins in the testicles, the most common cause of infertility in males — may now undergo a simple operation that is often successful. A doctor can diagnose this condition simply by probing above the testicles while the standing patient strains the muscles in his lower abdomen. Dr. Richard D. Amelar, a New York urologist specializing in male infertility who has performed hundreds of operations with his partner, Dr. Lawrence Dubin, to correct this condition, has said that the surgery results in pregnancies in more than half of the cases in which semen analysis indicates that this is the cause of infertility. Sometimes a woman will develop antibodies — an allergic reaction — to her husband's sperm. Doctors have found that the use of a condom for a period of time, during which exposure to sperm is eliminated, often alleviates this problem. In cases where there is large seminal volume (more than five cubic centimeters) but a borderline sperm count (less than 20 million per cubic centimeter), an “at‐home” technique known as split ejaculation, whereby a man deposits only the first portion of his ejaculate in a woman's vagina, has been tried with considerable success. A practice that has been rapidly gaining acceptance in the treatment of infertile couples when the husband has an extremely low sperm count is artificial insemination. While the practice of inserting another man's semen remains controversial and legally ambiguous, experts say that thousands of couples nationwide secretly elect this procedure every year. Despite these many advances, however, when a couple is finally enabled to conceive, the mother still may have difficulty carrying her child to term. Whereas the miscarriage rate normally is 15 percent, in infertile women who eventually conceive, it may be as high as 40 percent. Sandra James was sitting in a Park Avenue doctor's office with a satisfied grin and an enthusiasm in her speech that those who know her well had not heard in years. Miss James, who is 30 years old, was at her obstetrician's office. She was perched on a straight wooden chair with her hands pressed against her belly, as if they would transmit an extra warmth that would be acknowledged by a flutter of appreciation from within. “It has been 13 weeks,” she was saying, as if she could not believe that, after three years of trying, it was finally true. The doctor called Miss James into the examining room and listened for the fetus's heartbeat. He heard nothing but reassured her that “it was still early.” Miss James made an appointment to come back in two weeks. “I want to have this baby,” she said afterward, the simplicity of her statement underscoring its power. That Miss James is black and poor has little to do with her bout with infertility. Like many women, rich and poor, who are unable to conceive, her Fallopian tubes did not function properly, and one ovary did not, either. Through surgery, her tubes were freed from adhesions that had rendered them nonfunctional. In addition, she took costly monthly injections and pills to induce ovulation. But unlike wealthier victims of reproductive disorders, Miss James, a $139‐a‐week clerk at a Lower Manhattan printing company, has gone into debt trying to have a baby. “ I don't know how I'm going to pay $950 to the obstetrician,” she said. “I still owe the fertility clinic $392. But I will. If there's a will, there's a way.” Miss James has spent every last penny of her salary on treatments. Her company's insurance does not cover infertility treatments — most medical insurance plans do not —and she is, she says, “too proud to go on welfare.” She cannot imagine a life without a child. “I used to cry and cry and cry. I have a rocking chair, and I would sit in it and rock and cry. I felt like half a woman, not a whole woman. Sometimes I wanted to die. I had no will to live.” For a long time Miss James, who had taken birth‐control pills for five years until she and her companion decided to have a child, told no one about her plight. Afraid that he might abandon her, she even kept it for some time from her companion. “‘What's wrong with you?' he always asked me. ‘You have woman problems?’ It was always me. It was never him. He wouldn't even come with me to the doctor's. He said, ‘Nothing's wrong with me. Why should I go?’ “ When Miss James finally consulted a doctor on her own, she had to take a sample of her companion's sperm in a glass jar on the subway from the Bronx. “I was afraid,” said Miss James. “I thought he would leave. He didn't like the sex on schedule. ‘It will happen if it will happen,’ he would always say. But I told him it would have to be every other day. If he wanted a baby too, he would have to do it. And he did it. He did what I told him.” Miss James learned she was pregnant last July. She and her companion, who asked not to be identified, spent hours discussing names and making plans to move into a larger apartment. Her mother bought diapers and bottles to give her daughter at Christmas. Her sister gave her a bassinet. It was last September that Miss James sat waiting to hear her baby's heartbeat at the doctor's office. Five days later, she had a miscarriage. According to her obstetrician, Dr. Irving Buterman, the cause of the miscarriage remains a mystery — as is often the case after seemingly successful treatment for infertility. “It took three years to happen,” Miss James said from her hospital bed. Her mother and companion were with her, but there was little either of them could say. “Can I do it again?” Miss James asked. “Can I go through those treatments again? I don't want to go through the agony again, the awful pain. You think you're dying.” Miss James was weeping. A nurse entered and helped her sit up to take a pill. “But now I know I am a woman,” Miss James said. “I can conceive and I will try again. I won't give up. I can't give up.” At a time when most men and women can decide how many children they want and when, the infertile couple often feel alone, cheated of an option they had long taken for granted, an experience they still regard as a rite of passage into adulthood. In an era of choice, they have been denied the right to decide. Often plagued by guilt, they scan their pasts, looking for an answer to why they have been (Continued on Page 149) Continued from Page 69 singled out. Some attempt to atone for perceived past sins. Others, finding none, take their frustrations out on themselves. “I hear the words over and over again,” said Dr. Miriam Biddelman, a Central Park West psychotherapist specializing in infertility counseling. “‘Defective,’ ‘freak,’ eunuch,’ ‘mannish.’ But the strongest feeling I deal with is anger — anger at doctors, their spouses, themselves.” Infertility can create strife and tension in even the most secure marriage. Because society often equates the ability to have a child with sexual prowess, some men and women seek self‐affirmation elsewhere. Previously faithful couples begin to have extramarital affairs, some harboring the suspicion that conception may be possible with someone else. Barbara Eck Menning, a nurse and author who founded Resolve, the national organization devoted to infertility counseling, says that infertility can bring a couple closer together than ever before, or tear them utterly apart. However, even though abandonment is a common fear, Mrs. Menning says that a spouse rarely leaves because of infertility. In the initial stages of dealing with the problem, affixing “blame” and “fault” may vent frustration and anger, but in a healthy relationship, this passes quickly. The battery of medical examinations, the fertility “workup,” imposes a strain of its own. What with the charts, tubes and scheduled sex (every other day for two weeks out of the month), intercourse becomes mechanical, depersonalized. Couples feel violated, robbed of sexual spontaneity, invaded by clinical eyes. Some couples begin to avoid intercourse, and then berate each other for not really wanting children. It's a vicious cycle. “Frequently the ‘workup' will flip the male into my office,” said Dr. Herbert E. Walker, a psychiatrist associated with New York University School of Medicine who often treats sexual dysfunction related to infertility. “He feels forced to perform. Suddenly a third party appears in the bedroom and is judging how well he's doing.” In helping couples resolve their feelings, many psychologists tell them it is important to grieve. The anguish of men and women told they will never be able to have a child is often as intense as that of a couple who have lost a baby. It is only after they have accepted and mourned the loss of the child they will never have that a couple can move on with their lives. Some psychologists and psychiatrists prepare couples for adopting a child by helping them distinguish between the desire to achieve a pregnancy, on the one hand, and the desire to be a parent, on the other. These are two separate needs, these experts say, and if couples can accept this, they can successfully adjust to raising a child borne by someone else. There is a point infertile couples reach, somewhere beyond hope but short of resignation, when having their own children becomes an acknowledged impossibility. For some, this may lead to a decision to adopt. For others, it may bring the realization that a life without children can be rich and that they have already found happiness in each other. Mary‐Pat and Kevin Monaghan, of Selden, L. I, are such a couple. When the Monaghans were married six years ago, both at the age of 20, children were taken as much for granted as the wedding bands on their fingers. “We'll have two and adopt two,” they replied whenever anyone asked — a number that by their standards (each comes from a large Catholic family) was small. After three years of trying without success to conceive, it was with embarrassment and hesitation that they sought medical assistance. “I didn't want to do it,” said Mr. Monaghan, who is in charge of maintenance for a Long Island fast‐food chain. It was not that they did not want to learn what was wrong, but that neither felt comfortable with the language of sex or public discussion of their intimacies. The postcoital examination was particularly unpleasant. “That's very difficult, knowing you have to have relations at a certain time,” Mrs. Monaghan was saying. “Your appointment is at 11 and it's 9:30. You're thinking, ‘Should I try to start?’ You're made to function. And when you do, you want to hurry up and get it over with. It's something to reduce someone you love down to that level.” But they went through the test once, twice, more times than they care to remember. And still the diagnosis was the same: nothing was “wrong” with either of them. “By this time I was angry,” Mrs. Monaghan said, “that no one had answers, that there was no one to help us out there.” Mrs. Monaghan learned about the Resolve organiza tion and decided to start a chapter on Long Island. It was soon after that that Mrs. Monaghan finally became pregnant. Almost afraid to admit it to themselves, the Monaghans kept it a secret for three months. Then, deciding that it was “safe,” they took off two weeks from work and went to Buffalo to share the news with their families. “We told them,” Mrs. Monaghan said, “and 12 hours later, I started to abort. There was a party all ready to go. But Key and I went to the hospital. We didn't tell anyone. I have little brothers and sisters, and I did not want them to go through it.” “When the doctor told us the baby was dead,” Mr. Monaghan said, “all Mary‐Pat wanted was to see her doctor.” Until the last moment, Mrs. Monaghan believed that her doctor on Long Island, the one who had helped her get pregnant in the first place, would save her. “So we got in the truck,” he continued. “It was the longest ride I ever had. Pat was crying and screaming. By the time we got to Syracuse, we couldn't go any farther.” “I could never go to Syracuse again,” Mrs. Monaghan said. “Everyone else can mourn for a child that died. If you talk to someone who has a child and tell them, they'll say there's no comparison, that it isn't really the same. But I had nothing to compare it to. It was the biggest loss of my life. There was no wake. There was no grave. No remembrance. Just a toilet.” When they reached Long Island, there was nothing left for Mrs. Monaghan's doctor to do, except to perform a dilation and curettage to cleanse her reproductive system. “The last thing he told me as I was going under the anesthetic was, ‘Don't blame yourself.' And, it was just horrifying because I didn't blame myself. Maybe I should have, but I didn't. If anyone, I blamed him. Why didn't my doctor warn me? Why couldn't he do anything for me?” It has been more than a year now since the miscarriage, and the Monaghans have moved out of their small apartment into a three‐bedroom house that they say they bought for just the two of them. They have decided that, even without children, “they are whole,” and that their life together has meaning. Mrs. Monaghan says she used to dwell on the fantasy of coming home one day from the supermarket and announcing to her husband, “Surprise! Yep. I'm pregnant.” But now the Monaghans say they do not want to suffer through a miscarriage again. They want to put an end to the ambiguity of their existence so that they can resume and rejuvenate their lives. Mrs. Monaghan has a new job at a local bank and Is attending school at night to learn computer programming. Perhaps someday they will adopt, but not now. “I have no time now for a child,” she says. What they talk about are vasectomies and other permanent methods of birth control. Their quest for children, they say, is over. “If I became pregnant again,” said Mrs. Monaghan, “I'd have a really big decision to make. I don't want to have to make a big decision.” While this talk of finality brings comfort, it also frightens the couple. Mr. Monaghan admits that if his wife should become pregnant, it would be a source of great joy. He fears the kind of person he will become without the experience of having children. Mrs. Monaghan worries about growing old. To whom, she wonders, will she pass on her china. “We're not trying to have a child. Am I correct about this?” Mrs. Monaghan suddenly asks, surprised at their own ambivalence. “I'm not forcing myself,” Mr. Monaghan says. It is late. The Monaghans have not yet eaten dinner —one of the many luxuries, they say, in not having a child. They have learned to enjoy their freedom. They settle back in their comfortable living room and show a visitor a small stained‐glass plaque that sits over the fireplace. It is something they picked up on Cape Cod after the miscarriage. It reads: “God grant us serenity to accept the things we cannot change, courage to change the things we can, and wisdom to know the difference.” These days, over the hearth of their home, it is never out of sight. ■"
Mexican President Unexpectedly Opposes Legalization of Abortion Campaign Is 4 Years Old,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/17/archives/mexican-president-unexpectedly-opposes-legalization-of-abortion.html,"MEXICO CITY, Dec. 16 — Amid a growing campaign in Mexico in favor of the legalization of abortion, President José López Portillo has unexpectedly described abortion as a barbaric practice and has expressed outright opposition to it. “I think there are more civilized and reasonable ways of controlling the birth rate,” he said at a recent news conference. Proponents of a change in the law, who say they will press on with their campaign despite the President's disapproval, maintain that their objective is not to curb population growth but to reduce the number of victims of unhygienic “back street” abortions. “It's a woman's right not to die because of a clandestine abortion,” said Anilu Elias, a leader of the women's movement. “Even if there were zero population growth, a woman has a right to a free and safe abortion.” Estimates of the number of illegal abortions annually range from 800,000 to 1.2 million, and more than 10,000 women die every year as a result of abortion complications, according to Government estimates. Other studies indicate that only 8 percent of abortions are performed under proper medical supervision. The campaign for a change in the abortion law — to revoke the penalties for abortions and instruct the health authorities to provide such a service — was started by feminist groups four years ago after the first official family‐planning program was instituted. This fall the National Front for the Liberation and Rights of Women won the support of the Communist Party for its position on abortion. Last month Commu nist members of Congress introduced the first bill to legalize abortion. The preamble to the bill, which will probably not be taken up before late next year, says abortion should not be seen as a birth‐control method. “We talk of the broader concept of voluntary maternity,” said Marta Lamas, a member of the Women's Liberation Movement. “This encompasses sex education, efficient, cheap and safe contraceptive methods and, only as a last resort, abortion.” Advocates of legalization were taken aback by the President's comment. Given Mr. Lopez Portillo's overwhelming power, the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party seems certain to oppose the change in Congress."
Yet Another Assault on Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/17/archives/yet-another-assault-on-abortion.html,"However tired others may get, the House never seems to tire of pushing the Senate against abortion. Congress recently reached a compromise in its annual argument about whether to pay the costs of abortions for poor women. But annual arguments must seem too infrequent; the House has tacked anti‐abortion amendments to yet another piece of legislation even though knows the Senate will balk. The burdened bill would create a child health assurance program to get more medical care to needy children and pregnant women. The House approved the program, which is fine. But the anti‐abortion drive now jeopardizes the whole idea. The child health program does not deserve to be delayed by one obsessive issue. At a cost of about $1 billion a year for the next five years, it would expand health screening and treatment among poor children. It would extend care to older youngsters than those treated now and to children in two‐parent families. Care would be available also for teen‐aged mothers who are pregnant for the first time. A slighty less generous version of the program has been cleared by a Senate committee and awaits floor action. But the abortion amendments would undo the House‐Senate accord so painstakingly found after Thanksgiving. As now agreed, Medicaid may pay for abortions performed on women whose lives are endangered or who are victims of rape or incest. If the House gets its way, the victims of such crimes would no longer be eligible. The House would also make clear that Federal law does not oblige states to pay for abortions under other circumstances. This provision could pull the legal rug from under state courts that have been inclined to rule that the Federal law requires states to pay for abortions that are considered medically necessary. Federal outlays for abortions have already dropped by 99 percent since Congress tightened the restrictions several years ago. The House thus pursues ideology more than policy as it drives for 100 percent. For the sake of getting on with important legislation, for the welfare of poor women who need abortions and for the health of poor children who need medical care, the Senate needs to find a way around this bullying."
Preliminary Israeli Vote Backs a Curb on Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/18/archives/preliminary-israeli-vote-backs-a-curb-on-abortions-more-women-will.html,"JERUSALEM, Dec. 17— Led by politicians from the religious bloc, Prime Minister Menachem Begin's coalition succeeded today in winning a preliminary vote to repeal a section of an Israeli law allowing abortions for family and other social reasons. The action by Parliament reversed a tie vote Nov. 13 that rejected an effort to tighten the statute. Today, by 58 votes to 53, Parliament passed on first reading an amendment demanded by members of the ultra‐Orthodox Agudat Israel as the price for remaining in the coalition. To win the measure's approval Mr. Begin made it a vote of confidence in the Government, effectively forcing affirmative votes from a few legislators who opposed the change the first time. The amendment now goes to committee, then returns to the floor for second and third readings, at which it is also expected to pass. The modification would still legalize abortions for those who are unmarried, over age, the victims of rape or susceptible to psychiatric damage. In eliminating the fifth condition, in which “the continuation of pregnancy is liable to cause serious harm to the woman or her children, owing to the difficult family or social conditions of the woman and her environment,” the legislation would have the greatest impact on poor women who get abortions in state‐run hospitals. Women in better circumstances will be able to get abortions from private physicians just as they did, illegally, before the provision, enacted under the previous Government, headed by the Labor Party, took effect last year. “More doctors will get rich, more women will suffer,” said Shulamit Aloni, a liberal politician. “There will be more tragedy, more ignorance, more poverty. I hope courageous doctors will step forward and say they are prepared to go on trial to perform abortions.” About 150 social workers demonstrated outside Parliament against the change, chanting, “Children must be raised, not only born.” Several of the protesters, seeing a group of black‐hatted Hasidic Jews at the gate waiting for the vote, shouted at them, “Down with Khomeinism!” The issue has exposed severe tensions between the ultra‐Orthodox and many other Israelis. Some of the others, noting an upsurge of influence on the Government by the ultra‐Orthodox, have likened it to the billowing of Islamic orthodoxy. Though Agudat Israel has only 4 of the 65 seats in the governing coalition, its withdrawal would leave Mr. Begin with precarious majority of one. The only political issue in Israel on which there is unanimity is the prediction that if he had to go to elections now, he would lose, so no one in the Government wants to bring down and face the the people at the polls. Consequently, when Mr. Begin decided to make the abortion issue a vote of confidence, party discipline prevailed. He invoked an obscure law requiring ministers to vote with the Government in such an event or resign. Exempted were the members of the Democratic Movement who joined the coalition after this arrangement was made. Two Democratic Movement ministers voted against the amendment —Deputy Prime Minister Yigael Yadin and the Minister of Justice, Shmuel Tamir. All the Liberal members of Parliament who were present — three were absent voted in favor. Mr. Begin's Likud faction, with two absent, voted with him. Sara Doron, a Liberal who voted against the amendment last month, when it lost by 54 votes to 54, and voted in favor today, said: “I feel very bad, and I hope to live to see a time when it will be changed. I didn't change my views. I only changed my vote because it was put as a confidence vote in this Government.”"
News Summary,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/18/archives/news-summary-international.html,"A final accord on Rhodesia was reached as leaders of the Patriotic Front guerrillas accepted a British cease‐fire plan aimed at ending the seven‐year civil war. The agreement, achieved after 14 weeks of intensive negotiations in London, also provides for a new independence constitution and early parliamentary elections. The guerrilla leaders said that private assurances by Britain had helped convince them of fair treatment under the truce. [Page A1, Column 6.] The militant Iranians occupying the American Embassy and holding 50 hostages in Teheran express the will of the people and are not setting a separate foreign policy, Ayatollah Khomeini said. Broadcast comments by the Iranian leader left in doubt whether Iran would react to the flight of the Shah from the United States to Panama by carrying out a threat to try the captives for espionage. [A1:4‐5.] Washington expressed frustration over the disagreements in the Iranian leadership over American hostages in Teheran and vowed that new economic pressures would be exerted on Iran unless the captives were freed. [A10:4‐6.]  The taking of hostages is outlawed in a code approved without dissent by the United Nations General Assembly. The convention requires signers to prosecute hostage‐takers or return them to their homelands to stand trial “without exception whatsoever.” Adoption of the code culminates a three‐year effort begun by West Germany. [A1:5.] A curb on some abortions was given preliminary approval in the Israeli Parliament. The elimination of a provision allowing abort ions for family and other social reasons was adopted on a first reading and is expected to win final passage. [A3:4‐6.] The blocking of aid to Cambodians by the Phnom Penh Government was reported by the Red Cross, which warned that relief shipments of food and medicine might not continue indefinitely if the authorities did not distribute them. A Red Cross official said after an inspection tour that very little of about 33,000 tons of supplies delivered had been given out.

[A5:1.] Energy Approval of a “windfall” profits tax on the oil industry was voted by the Senate, 74 to 24. The Senate version of President Carter's proposed levy, believed to be the largest single tax ever imposed on an industry, would increase Federal revenues by $178 billion from 1980 to 1990. The bill passed last summer by the House of Representatives would raise about $276 billion. The measures must be reconciled by a conference committee. [A1:1‐2.] Higher Iranian oil prices were confirmed by Teheran's oil minister, who said that the charge would be raised by $5 a barrel to $28.50, or nearly 68 cents a gallon. The announcement was made at the opening in Caracas of a ministerial meeting of the petroleum‐exporting countries and heightened speculation that they would be unable to agree on a uniform price for 1980.

The Complaints of the Women's Lobby,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/19/archives/the-complaints-of-the-womens-lobby-when-now-was-too-soon.html,"We've held back comment on the rejection President Carter's candidacy by the National Organization for Women. The nominating convention is eight months off and the election is 11 months off. Perhaps, we thought, there is a way out of that tightly painted corner, or an explanation. Alas, the ineptitude stands unrelieved. NOW should try to get out of its corner even before the paint dries. Advocates of women's rights have every right criticize the Administration. Mr. Carter endorsed the equal rights amendment long ago but, as NOW insists, hasn't twisted many arms in hold‐out state legislatures. He has also opposed spending Medicaid money for abortions; and that, says NOW correctly, has undermined resistance in Congress to the mean‐spirited campaign against abortions for poor women. But Mr. Carter has also advanced the cause of women's rights by appointing many women to the Federal bench and to high executive positions. Only this week, he chose Prof. Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a veteran of the women's movement, for the Appellate Court. But NOW leaders say these appointments aren't enough. “With the expansion of the Federal courts,” says NOW's president, Eleanor Smeal, “he had a great opportunity but he retreated. Female judgeships increased from 3 to 5 percent and that is no big thing. Our major concerns are women's issues, not jobs.” So NOW rejects Mr. Carter's candidacy. But what has it done to itself? If confronted finally by a choice between Mr. Carter and a candidate it would regard as even less sympathetic to its cause, NOW's leaders say that they would then work only in state and local elections. We'd like to know how one gains greater political influence by withdrawing from political campaigns."
Where NOW Has a Point,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/19/archives/where-now-has-a-point.html,"The National Organization for Women and other groups have raised a more persuasive complaint against a Federal judge in Boise, Idaho, who is hearing a court challenge that could kill the Equal Rights Amendment. The judge, Marion Callister, also holds a high position in the Mormon Church, one of the most energetic opponents of the amendment. Nobody argues that Judge Callister is unfit to try the suit merely because of his religion. Catholic judges are not and should not be disqualified from abortion cases; Quaker jurists are not barred from disputes over military service. But Judge Callister holds the lay Mormon post of Regional Representative. He is one of about 100 men who supervise congregations and keep local churches in touch with the national church about policies and programs, including some political objectives. It seems entirely reasonable for supporters of the amendment to be concerned that the judge's high church rank and duties might influence his judgment on a matter of such importance to the Mormon high command. The suit before Judge Callister was brought by Arlzona and Idaho. They seek to invalidate Congress's extension of the time in which the amendment may be ratified by the states. They also ask for a judicial declaration that states are free to withdraw previous ratifications. The Justice Department, defending what Congress has done, contends the suit is premature. Moreover, the department shares the concerns of the women's groups and asked the judge to remove himself from the case. He refused, with a memorandum that glosses over the demands of the Federal law on disqualification and fails to allay the doubts about his impartiality. Solicitor General McCree decided not to appeal the ruling, saying it would delay the case, including appeal of this point. The women's groups have asked Attorney General Civiletti to press again for Judge Callister's withdrawal. They fear that an adverse judgment, even if ultimately overturned, would cripple their political drive for ratification in legislatures early next year. Whatever the legal and political merits of all these tactics, the bid for a more clearly impartial judge is in no sense frivolous. Indeed, Congress made clear in 1979, when it changed the rules of disqualification, that the appearance of justice has a lot to do with the reality of it. Mr. Civiletti can address that problem immediately, as we think he should, or later, as the course of the case might justify. NOW has raised a serious question that the courts, sooner or later, will have to face."
Feminists Cool To NOW Stand Against Carter,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/21/archives/feminists-cool-to-now-stand-against-carter-many-different.html,"In the aftermath of last week's controversial condemnation of President Carter by the National Organization for Women, women's groups around the country are reassessing their own agendas. Despite NOW's generally accepted position of leadership, most women's groups seem to be deciding that, as Joyce Miller, president of the Coalition of Labor Union Women, put it : “Each group has to do its own thing.” Iris Mitgang, chairman of the National Women's Political Caucus, said, “My guess is most feminists are so independent that although they may take into consideration what their leadership says, they will make their decisions as individuals.” Although NOW is acknowledged to have a significant influence, particularly in its role as a strategist for ratification of the equal rights amendment, leaders of other women's groups stress that they don't follow NOW automatically. Indeed, most consider the attack on Mr. Carter premature if not ill advised. Saying it would not support the President's re‐election, NOW assailed his record on the E.R.A., contending that his support has been insufficiently aggressive, and condemned his opposition to Medicaid financing for abortions. As a result of that criticism, the president of NOW, Eleanor C. Smeal, was not invited to a White House meeting between Mr. Carter and leaders of other women's groups last week. NOW officials asked many of them to boycott the meeting to express solidarity, but they refused. Many Different Constituencies While Mrs. Smeal calls her group “the largest grass‐roots feminist organization” in the country, she added that “the women's movement is a coalition with a lot of different constituencies. Women are not a monolithic group, and I don't think anybody should expect them to express dissatisfaction in the same way,” she said. However, Christine Candela, president of the Women's Equity Action League, said, “I think it would be foolish to underestimate NOW's influence in the women's movement. I'd say the whole movement is dependent on NOW's leadership on the E. R.A. right now. On the other hand, as leader of a different organization which represents a more moderate constituency than NOW's, I'd say we would pay a lot of attention to any stand they took, but we certainly wouldn't just fall in step.” The National Organization for Women is frequently regarded as “the cutting edge of the women's movement,” in Miss Candela's words. But partly because of its position in the Leaders of other women's groups feel the attack was premature and intend to go their own way. vanguard and partly because of its tactics, other women's groups often agree with its ends but not with its means. “E.R.A. is also our No. 1 priority, but we approach it in a very different way from NOW,” said Irma Brosseau, executive director of the National Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs. “We are not demonstrators; we do not get headlines. We have a much more legislatively oriented approach.” Mary Grefe, president of the American Association of University Women and a resident of Des Moines, said, “Most of our members out here would regard NOW as fairly militant. There's a wariness of it — not necessarily terribly critical, but there's the idea that NOW will do its thing, picketing or whatever, while our members would prefer to work in other ways.” Some are harsher in their assessment. “The majority of our women are more conservative, and they have objected strongly to what they consider the influence of more radical groups like NOW,” said Mary Elizabeth Quint, president of the General Federation of Women's Clubs. “In fact I think NOW has hurt the E.R.A. within our membership, which feels groups like NOW have brought in other issues that are not pertinent, like lesbianism and this type of thing.” NOW's advocacy of homosexual rights, as part of its policy of human rights for every group, is viewed by officials of other organizations as simply one aspect of the organization's agenda, just as their own groups have individual agendas. “As black women, our No. I priority is education, jobs and housing,” said Dorothy Height, president of the National Council of Negro Women. “We put the passage of the E.R.A. as a priority, and we want to throw our full force behind it, but we can't neglect our other priorities.” Minority Women Estranged From the Movement Many minority women have long felt estranged from the feminist movement, believing it to be more a reflection of the concerns of white women. “I think they are viewed by minority women as ‘the National Organization for White Women,’ ” said Wilma Espinoza, president of the Mexican American Women's National Association. “We focus on Chicanas, and they don't. We watch what they do, but we have our own agenda.” The isolating effect of NOW's attack on President Carter was of particular concern to many minority women, who tend to feel their task is to gain a foothold inside the system rather than to alienate themselves from it. “We Puerto Rican women have had so little input in any other administration that we feel at least we're in there talking now,” said Angela Cabrera, president of the National Conference of Puerto Rican Women and one of the leaders invited to last week's meeting with Mr. Carter. “We do not want to cut ourselves out.” One of the more immediate concerns for other women's leaders has been the potential negative impact of NOW's move on the E. R.A. ratification drive, which has the support of a coalition of church, labor, academic and many other groups and which has played a significant role in unifying women's groups around a common goal. “I personally think NOW used very bad strategy,” said Shirley Leviton, president of the National Council of Jewish Women. “When you isolate yourself there's very little you can do. I really think they've hurt the cause.” But whatever their differences with NOW, other women's leaders often support the impulse behind it. “We all have to take risks in order to move ahead,” said Martha Edens, general director of Church Women United. “That's how social progress happens.”"
Keepsakes and Valentines,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/23/archives/keepsakes-and-valentines-teasdale.html,"HISTORY has not been kind to Sara Teasdaie. You will not find her poems in the Norton An- thology of Modern Poetry, the Oxford Book of American Verse or the Mentor Book of Major Ameri- can Poets. But in the teens and the 1920's, her rhymed lyrics of love and loss were hugely popular -“her vol- umes were Keepsakes and valentines, the co‐ed's un- failing companion, and the Bible of every disap- pointed lover,” as her friend Louis Untermeyer envi- ously noted in his memoirs - and she was respected by critics and fellow poets. She won a Pulitzer Prize and saw a book of her verse on the best seller list, a feat no poet today is likely to duplicate. It would be nice to think that this comprehensive and thought‐provoking biography will do something to give Teesdale a permanent, if small niche in the his- tory of American poetry. She is a good poet, if not a great one - much better than her splashy contempo- raries Vachel Lindsay and Carl Sandburg, for in- stance, to say nothing of the dreadful poetasters - the Untermeyers, Jessie Rittenhouse, John Myers‐O'Hara -who were her friends. Her best lyrics have an emo- tional simplicity and a musicality that are still mov- ing: Let it be forgotten as a flower is forgotten. Forgotten as a fire that once was singing gold, Let it be forgotten for ever and ever, Time is a kind friend, he will make us old. Born in 1884, on the cusp of the Victorian and mod- em eras, the last and very belated child of a wealthy St. Louis merchant and his wife, Teesdale had an overprotected and isolated girlhood. She was treated like an invalid, dressed always in gray or white, for- bidden rough-and-tumble play - she used to receive her little Mends for tea at appointed hours, like a prin- cess - and imbued by her prudish mother with all sorts of sexual fears. Had shit been born a generation or two earlier, she would surely have become a rec- luse, like the 19th‐century women poets with whom William Drake places her - Emily Dicldnson, Emily Bronte, Elizabeth Barrett and Christina Rossetti. As it was, the damage was deep. Sbe was painfully shy- too shy, for example, to read her poems in pub- lic. She suffered all her life, from a host of real and im- ginary illnesses as well as a chronic “low vitality” that sounds like a permanent depression. (She even believed a doctor's absurd diagnosis that she had been born lacking a layer of skin.) Worst of all, her literary ambition and her sensuality were both blocked by an overwhelming need to be, or appear to be, complai- santly and conventionally feminine. The struggle be- tween the two halves of her nature - pagan and Puri- tan, as she called them - eventually cost her her life. “I don't want to be a ‘literary woman,’ “ Teesdale wrote in her mid‐20's, already a published and hard- working poet. “Art can never mean to a woman what it does to a man. Love means that” For Teesdale, love meant “kneeling” in worship and submission to a sublime and powerful man. (Mr. Drake doesn't say so, preferring to blame Sara's character on her mother, Katha Pollitt is a poet and freelance reviewer. but surely her adored, autocratic father was at the back of her view of men as all‐important and omnipo- tent beings whose love must be purchased with self- suppression.) And so, while countless women of her generation went off to colleges and careers, she spent her whole youth in her parents mansion, writing her “songs,” as she liked to call her poems, and longing for a white knight to rescue her from loneliness and dependence. Who would it be? John Hall Wheelock, who was the great love of her life and seems to have been even shyer than she was, rejected her after two years of ladylike hints. Vachel Lindsay wrote her passionate letters, but he was too poor and too crazy to take seriously. On the desperate edge of 30, she married Ernst Filsinger, a St. Louis businessman, and more or less regretted it for the rest of her life. Teasdale's abhorrence of direct self‐assertion (she loathed feminists) did not mean she was passive; she simply resorted to covert forms of self‐will. One struck by the skill with which she exploited the con ventlonal image of woman as fragile, ethereal and cold in order to protect her artistic self from the demands of wifehood and to replicate the sheltering isolation of her childhood within married life. She and Ernst had separate bedrooms from the start, and her only pregnancy- despite her statements that motherhood was woman's noblest calling - was terminated by abortion. “Low vitality” prevented her from joining Ernst on his globe‐trotting business travels, and his return was usually followed by her own immediate departure to the country for a rest cure - and a bout of writing. In one 18‐month period she and Ernst lived together fora total of six weeks. In the end, though, this covertness was her undoing, for it left her with a bitter sense that she bad denied herself the sweets of life. “With my own will,” she wrote, “I vanquished my own heart.” When, after 15 years of marriage, she obtained a divorce (traveling to Reno under an assumed name for fear of scandal), the rigid persona in which she had precariously balanced the demands of art and conventional femininity was unable to unbend in independence. Lonely, obsessed with hypochondriacal fears of a stroke, despondent over her declining fame - the fine, austere poems of her last poetic flowering had not been well received, although they were her best work - she killed herself at 48, Teesdale herself could not have wished for a better biographer than Wiliam Drake: he is sympathetic, astute, utterly without condescension. His detailed treatment of Teasdale's historical context - St. Louis's brief moment as the Athens of the Middle West, the women'sclub movement, the genteel tradition in poetry - gives a more balanced picture of bourgeois literary America than one finds in biographies of the great moderns - Frost, Pound, Eliot, Williams - who rebelled against it. It is a bit like looking at a familiar picture upside down, so that such stock figures of fun as Amy Lowell and Jessie Rittenhouse look for a change like sensible and serious Mr. Drake's ranking of Teasdale with the 19th‐century women poets mentioned earlier leads him to make some intrigu- ing suggestions about a possible female tradition in AngloAmerican poetry. There is much to ponder in his notion that the particular limitations of women's love poetry, with its cycle of rapt anticipation. rejection, resignation and longing for death, are connected to guilt about literary ambition as well as about the expression of sexual feelings. Less persuasive is Mr. Drake's claim that Teasdale, thanks to her later birthdate, attained a greater freedom of expression than her Victorian sisters. Here he is, I think, too partisan. Teesdale lacks, after all, the harsh sensuality of Bronte and even Rossetti ( see “Goblin Market” ), the intellectual command of Elizabeth Barrett, the metaphysical daring of Dickinson. Her work seems far more muted by self‐censorship than theirs, the product of a consistent and lifelong habit of translating unacceptable feelings of rage and hostility into acceptable ones of gentle resignation, sadness. No wonder her favorite adjective was Could it be that the very straightforwardness of Victorian restrictions helped give women writers, for all their loneliness and misery, the courage of their gifts? Knowing one's enemy makes for a steely soul. By Teasdale's time, however, there was just enough theoretical flexibility in woman's lot to confuse a gifted woman, to make her feel that the price of ambition was not spinsterhood but redoubled efforts to prove her femininity through marriage and to disclaim competition with men by keeping her work small and delicate and pleasant. It is no accident that it was Teesdale, not the Victorian women poets, who married a man she did not truly love rather than risk not marrying at all. If it is in the lives of Bronte, Dickinson, Rossetti and Barrett that we see the price they paid for their gifts, it is in the poems of Teesdale that we feel the price she paid for ■ Author's Query For an authorized biography of the late poet Robert Lowell (1917‐77), I would appreciate hearing from friends, literary acquaintances and ex‐students who might have letters from him or other information.

Anderson Is A Slow Starter But Has Some Quick Ideas,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/23/archives/anderson-is-a-slow-starter-but-has-some-quick-ideas-a-true-moderate.html,"WASHINGTON — Six months ago at the University Wisconsin, as he was about to begin his run for the Republican Presidential nomination in 1980, Representative John Anderson of Illinois pledged to inject issues, controversial ones, into the campaign. “I don't care whether you call me a liberal,” he shouted to a cheering student audience. “I don't care whether you call me conservative. Just don't call me a man without ideas.” In the months since, the silver‐haired 20‐year Congressional veteran from Rockford, Ill., has put forward positions on a host of topics. And gotten very little attention. It is not for lack of outspokenness. Mr. Anderson can be as direct as John B. Connally, though he comes at things from the other side. Indeed, he chided Mr. Connally for “turning back the clock on campaign ethics” by refusing Federal matching campaign funds. He took issue with Ronald Reagan's proposal for political asylum for the Shah Iran. He has lately issued his own call for a 50‐50 plan to fight inflation and energy shortages: a 50-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax and a 50 percent cut in Social Security taxes. (When Senator Edward M. Kennedy called this “vintage Republican economic policy,” Mr. Anderson said the Massachusetts Democrat did not understand and challenged him to a debate.) A ‘True Moderate' in Trouble Alone among Republican contenders, he advocates all the following: approval of the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty, ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, freedom of choice on abortion, better tax incentives for investment and capital expansion, training in the private sector rather than “dead‐end jobs in the public sector” to combat unemployment, and welfare reform with work incentives. In short, Mr. Anderson calls himself the “only true moderate” in the Republican field. That may be his biggest trouble, since it sets him against the grain of a party that has been solidly in the hands of conservatives ever since Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona bested the eastern liberal challenge from Gov. Nelson Rockefeller of New York in 1964. He argues that only a Republican of his stripe can reach independents and Democrats and thereby win in November. However, he must first pass the litmus test of Republican primaries, where the party activists and even rank-and-file voters are mostly conservative. So far, he has won the respect of other politicians and commentators — a rival called him “the brightest man in the race,” The Wall Street Journal described him as “a thinker and probably the best orator Congress” ‐but not the support needed for nomination. Campaigning at near zero temperatures in Nashua, N. H., last week, Mr. Anderson reported a new sense of momentum in his campaign and a doubling of his public visibility in New Hampshire since Labor Day. Still, only four percent of the state's Republicans cite him as their choice, far behind the leaders, and he is operating on a shoe‐string budget because so far he has raised only $425,000. By comparison Mr. Connally, the leading fund‐raiser, has more than $8 million. Given the situation, a few have suggested that Mr. Anderson's real goal is not to win the Presidency but to raise the level of political debate. “People give me credit for being more of a philosopher king than I am,” he replies. “I have some competitive instincts. I won 10 elections and I don't intend to lose this one.” He appears to be not only undaunted, but unbending. George Bush and Senator Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, two other candidates sometimes typed as moderate though they are well to his right, have sought to make peace with the Republican right wing. But Mr. Anderson has not. Senator Baker has been making amends for supporting the Panama Canal treaties by opposing SALT II; Mr. Bush, under rightwing fire a year ago, resigned from the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission. Such accommodations may be necessary, according to other liberal Republicans. Representative Paul J. McCloskey Jr., the California liberal who ran a protest campaign against Richard M. Nixon in 1972, says polls in his district show that since 1967, the conservatives have doubled in strength, from 30 to 60 percent of Republicans, while liberals and moderates together have shrunk from 70 to 40 percent. “At the moment,” says a liberal Republican senator who twice considered a Presidential run but backed off, “the center line of the Republican Party has moved sufficiently far to the right that a genuine moderate like Anderson can't get a good hearing.” In the face of a strong conservative frontrunner like Mr. Reagan, moderate Republican Governors like William G. Milliken of Michigan, Robert Ray of Iowa, Richard Thornburgh of Pennsylvania and Pierre S. DuPont of Delaware have fended off pleas for support from Senator Baker and Mr. Anderson. Back in 1964, Governor Rockefeller suffered from similar hesitancy of other moderates. Furthermore, moderates seem less able than conservatives to develop the organizational muscle that is so vital to primary and caucus victories. A Late Start on Organization “It's hard to find a well‐organized moderate in either party,” observed John Deardourff, one of former President Ford's media consultants. “The passionate moderate is hard to find, and it usually takes passion to build enthusiasm and organization.” With their bent toward issues, liberal and moderate Republicans also tend to minimize the importance of organization. In this campaign, both Senator Baker and Mr. Anderson focused very late on their field organizations. By contrast Mr. Bush, who has positioned himself pragmatically between the moderates and the established right‐wing candidates, developed an organizational base early on. “I'm closer to Anderson ideologically than to Bush Baker,” Representative McCloskey said, echoing a view other liberal and moderate Republicans in Congress. “But I've chosen to help Bush because I feel that if we're going move the Republican Party away from the right, we've got do it gradually.” “I refuse to accept that kind of defeatism,” Mr. Anderson asserts. “I just happen to think I am different enough from this bland menage of candidates that people will perk up and listen to what I have to say.” Charlea Waller"
The World,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/23/archives/the-world-critics-display-a-first-strike-capacity-on-salt.html,"Jimmy Carter certainly doesn't need another crisis in foreign affairs, but one is building up in the Senate over ratification of the nuclear arms treaty with the Soviet Union. And in contrast to the moratorium on debate over Iran, the SALT II critics are relentless, numerous and vocal. In a fresh attack last week, 19 senators headed by the influential Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, wrote to President Carter suggesting delay on the ratification vote until after next year's election. Offering a prophecy and then proceeding to help fulfill it, the signers — 11 Republicans and 8 Democrats — contended that the arms treaty is headed for a defeat that could damage United States foreign policy. They urged Mr. Carter, during the postponement, to demonstrate an improved intelligence‐gathering capability, military manpower quality and an expanded military presence in volatile areas. They also want intensified missile development, to narrow “the window of vulnerability” in the early 1980's, when Moscow is expected to enjoy a temporary advantage in firststrike potential. In addition, they asked for plans to deter Soviet “aggressive activities” in developing countries and they want Mr. Carter to set a date for deploying cruise missiles in Europe. (In the Netherlands, where opposition to the new weapons is strong, the Dutch Government last week survived a parliamentary chal- Replying to the senators, the President stuck to his commitment to seek speedy vote on ratification, but the Administration was ready, he said, to hold discussions to seek “a bipartisan consensus” on arms control and defense policy. In another maneuver, treaty opponents forced Senator John Stennis of Mississippi, the dominant — until now — chairman of the Armed Services Committee, to release a report condemning the treaty, although the committee withheld endorsing the critics' recommendations. Senator Henry M. Jackson, Democrat of Washington, and Republicans John Tower of Texas and Barry Goldwater of Arizona led the fight. The Administration and Senator Stennis had argued that releasing the report undercut the treaty‐ratifying prerogatives of the Foreign Relations Committee. South Korea Gets A Hedged Pledge Formally taking office last week as President of South Korea, Choi Kyu Hah promised revision of the country's autocratic Constitution “in about year's time, unless any unexpected contingencies arise.” And elections? “As early as possible” after constitutional revision. These cautious promises, promptly criticized by South Korea's opposition parties, evidently represented the program that was least offensive to the generals who have been jockeying for behind-the-scenes power since President Park Chung Hee was assassinated in October. The United States, within the limits set by South Korea's security needs, has been urging swift reforms, viewing President Park's death as an opportunity to open up the Korean political process. However, Maj. Gen. Chon Too Hwan, who masterminded the arrest of at least 16 other senior officers earlier this month, prefers delay. General Chon also heads the investigation into the Park murder and is said to favor the swift execution of Kim Jae Kyu, the former head of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency, who was sentenced to death last week for the Park killing. The conviction is subject to appeal, and the sentence can only be carried out if President Choi signs a death warrant. At the sentencing, Mr. Kim said he would not beg for his life “as I have found a cause to die for. My motive was a wish to establish a foundation for peaceful changes of government. There was never a peaceful transfer of power in this country so far.” Israel Revises Its Abortion Law It is in the nature of parliamentary government that a small party sometimes can wield political power all out of proportion to its size. Which is why Prime Minister Menachem Begin's Likud coalition, threatened with dissolution, last week. passed a measure tightening Israel's abortion law. The vote ‐58 to 53 — caine after Mr. Begin made it a vote of confidence in his Government. It reversed an earlier negative vote, a 54‐54 tie on Nov. 13. The measure, in the form of an amendment to Israel's existing law, eliminates “difficult family or social conditions” as a legal reason for abortion. The amendment had been demanded by the ultra‐Orthodox Agudat Israel, whose four members in the Knesset had threatened to desert the Begin coalition if the amendment were not passed. Their withdrawal would have reduced Mr. Begin's alreadyshaky coalition to 61 members in the 120‐member Knesset. Backers of abortion also suffered a setback in Mexico, when President Jose Lopez Portillo, who has given heavy support to birth‐control programs in his country, announced that he opposed the growing campaign for legalization of abortion. “I think there are more civilized and reasonable ways of controlling the birth rate,” Mr. Lopez Portillo said. Mexican feminists, who have led the drive to legalize abortion, said their efforts are unrelated to concerns about the birth rate but are meant to reduce the number of victims of unhygienic “back street” abortions. Saudis Elaborate On Mosque Attack “Outside agitators” are a favorite scapegoat of governments attempting to explain away unrest. Still, the scope of the Nov. 20 attack on the Grand Mosque of Mecca made plausible Saudi official's remark last week that “international organizations, probably Russians,” may have had a role in the seizure of Islam's holiest shrine. Partly to protect the mosque but also because the rebels were so numerous and well‐organized, it took Saudi troops two weeks to smoke out the last of the 500 attackers. The Saudi official said that 50 of them, masquerading as mourners, smuggled weapons into the mosque in coffins; the attackers, he said, were mostly Saudi and some were Islamic ultrafundamentalists of the Oteba tribe. He suggested that they had been co‐opted by guerrillas trained in Aden, the capital of Southern Yemen, a Soviet ally. However, Crown Prince Fand was quoted on Riyadh radio last week as saying “no evidence” of a foreign role in the seizure had emerged. Whoever was responsible, the siege came to a particularly bloody end as the rebels retreated into the giant mosque's 220 underground rooms. The Saudi official said 300 attackers were killed or wounded, along with 20 hostages and 60 Saudi soldiers. He said that the 160 people who were captured, excluding 20 minors but including 20 women, were sure to be beheaded. A Rare Admission, Brezhnev Is Ailing Leonid I. Brezhnev has died a dozen deaths (most recently Oct. 18) — to believe the rumor‐mongers inside and outside the Soviet Union who scrutinize every Kremlin reception to see whether the 73-year-old Soviet leader is there. So last week, perhaps to make sure nobody thought he was dead when he failed to show up at a luncheon for visiting Angolans, Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko announced that Mr. Brezhnev was suffering from a cold. Actually, Mr. Gromyko said “a catarrhal indisposition,” but Radio Moscow colloquialized that to keep anyone from making a cancer out of catarrh. The reason for the rampant speculation, of course, is that Mr. Brezhnev has long been in very poor health. Also reported to be seriously ailing is Prime Minister Aleksei N. Kosygin. Mr. Kosygin, who is 75, has not been seen in public since October, but the Soviet media has kept silent about his condition. One Last Hurrah For Pierre Trudeau “Trudeaumania” is a relic of the 60's but Pierre Elliott Trudeau, at age 60, is not. He announced last week that he would run again for Prime Minister of Canada in the general elections Feb. 18. He accepted a Liberal Party draft, as he phrased it, to put an end to “unacceptably bad government” under the Progressive Conservatives of Joe Clark. Mr. Trudeau, said that, if elected, he would not serve the full term but would withdraw “well before the next election.” As for Mr. Clark, who spent less than seven months in power and narrowly lost a confidence vote over an austerity budget the week before last, he was again campaigning. He called Mr. Trudeau a leader from the 60'S without a platform for 1980. Caught somewhat by surprise by the confidence vote in their favor, Mr. Trudeau and his colleagues were hurriedly hammering together a new platform.

World News Briefs,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/26/archives/world-news-briefs-popes-christmas-message-affirms-abortion-stand.html,"ROME, Dec. 25 (Reuters) — Pope John Paul II used the traditional papal Christmas message today to reaffirm the Roman Catholic Church's opposition to birth control and abortion. In the address, “Urbi et Orbi” (""To the City and the World""), he said that the morality of nations centered on children. “The child is a test of our respect for the mystery of life, upon which, from the very first moment of conception, the Creator places the imprint of His image and likeness,” he said. “Let that child speak for the rights of every child, speak of every child's dignity, its significance in our lives.” He added that “the dignity of the child demands, on the part of parents and society, a great sensitivity of conscience.” He concluded by wishing the world a Merry Christmas in 33 languages. Israeli Parliament Ends Social Basis for Abortion Special to The New York Times TEL AVIV, Dec. 25 — The Government paid a political debt to a religious bloc today by winning abrogation of threeyear‐old legislation permitting abortion for social and economic reasons. The final vote in Parliament in Jerusalem on an amendment to the abortion law was 55 to 50, with the governing Likud bloc holding rebellious deputies in line by designating the vote a test of confidence in the Government of Prime Minister Menachem Begin. The device averted a Cabinet crisis. Agudat Israel, a member of the Government coalition, had made the continued support of its four deputies conditional upon passage of the amendment. Their defection would have left the coalition with 61 of 120 seats. Abortion is still legal in cases where the mother is under 18 or over 90, where the pregnancy resulted from out‐of‐wedlock or incestuous relations, where the fetus is believed to be physically or mentally damaged or where a continuation of pregnancy would endanger the mother's life or cause her physical or mental harm. The abrogated clause authorized abortions when continuation of pregnancy is liable to cause serious harm owing to difficult family or social conditions. Japanese Communists End 15‐Year Split With Soviet TOKYO, Dec. 25 (UPI) — A 15‐year breach in relations between the Communist Parties of Japan and the Soviet Union has been repaired. This became evident today with the issuance of a joint communiqué condemning China's invasion of Vietnam. Japanese dispatches from Moscow said that the communiqué, without directly mentioning China, branded its invasion of Vietnam early this year as “an act of hegemony carried out in disregard of peaceful negotiations.” The statement said the Soviet Union was seriously concerned about what it views as an anti‐Soviet alliance between Japan, the United States and China, the reports said. They said the communique made no reference to the dispute over four North Pacific islands claimed by Japan but held by the Russians since World War U. The two parties had been at odds since 1964, when the Japanese party expelled pro‐Moscow elements to follow a line independent of influences from the Soviet Union and China. The Japanese and Chinese parties are still at odds. French Government Is Ruled In Violation on Budget PARIS, Dec. 25 (AP) — The Government suffered a major embarrassment yesterday when it was judged to have breached the Constitution in the course of pushing the budget through the National Assembly. The ruling by the nine‐member Constitutional Council, long regarded as a docile referee between the executive and legislative branches, left France without a budget for 1980 and dramatized a worsening split in the governing coalition. The Council said Prime Minister Raymond Barre violated the Constitution by failing to put the budget through the two votes required by law — one on the income section and one on the expenditure section. Unable to get a majority for the income section, he chose to have the 499member house vote on the budget as a whole, winning a majority by making the vote a test of confidence in the Government. He is expected to call an urgent special session and try again to push the income section through."
Conservatives in Idaho Pressing,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/27/archives/conservatives-in-idaho-pressing-drive-to-defeat-senator-church.html,"BOISE, Idaho — Word has been out in political circles for months now that Senator Frank Church, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, is in big political trouble back home. He is high on the “hit list” of the National Conservative Political Action Committee, and the campaign against him went into high gear in mid‐summer, making it longer than the Presidential campaign. “Anybody But Church” ads have been dogging him, and his real competition, Steven D. Symms, a 9I‐year‐old fourterm Republican Congressman, plans to announce in mid‐January. On paper, Frank Church, a 55‐year‐old Democrat who has been in the Senate for 29 years, always appears to be in trouble politically in Idaho. Voters here do not register by party, but the Republicans have a clear majority. To win, Senator Church estimates that he needs to carry 90 percent of the Democrats, two‐thirds of the incependents and at least 20 percent of the Republicans. Attacked on Abortion He acknowledges that his vote for the Panama Canal treaties has cost him more home‐state support than anything else he has done, and the issue has been kept alive by the state's conservatives. In addition, his support of new wilderness areas has cost him the allegiance of lumbermen, miners and ranchers. The president of the Boise Cascade Corporation, one of the state's largest employers, is actively opposing him. The MorrisonKnudsen Company, the giant Idahobased construction concern, is not supporting him. Republicans accuse him of having gutted the Central Intelligence Agency with his 1976 investigative panel. Mr. Church is even being attacked by “right to life” groups. He opposes abortions except in cases where pregnancy is the result of rape or incest or would endanger the life of the mother. And he has gotten himself into a double bind on the treaty to limit nuclear arms, which is favored by less than half the people here, according to opinion polls. Those who do favor it seemed to be offended by what appeared to them to be a politically motivated stand by Senator Church linking passage of the treaty to a firm response by President Carter to the presence of Soviet troops in Cuba. Political Role of Wife After surveying that situation, the Senator said mournfully, “Maybe I'll be like Harry Truman, and only the people will be for me.” Senator Church can be an effective orator — he won a scholarship to Stanford University by winning the American Legion debate competition — and, on a stump, he is reminiscent of Hubert Humphrey. In small states, oratory still seems to have great impact. He also has 24 years of constituent service that is considered excellent. Every year the Senator gives Christmas parties for the elderly, and he never misses one. Last year, Mr. Church, a longstanding friend of Israel, turned down an invitation to be on the American delegation to Golda Meir's funeral so he could be in Idaho for the Christmas party. It seemed that almost everyone at those parties had got help from the Senator — with a pension problem or in getting a moon‐trip souvenir for a grand child. Or they knew the Senator's wife, Bethine. Mrs. Church is the daughter and niece of former Idaho governors, and she has either inherited or acquired a fine political sense. Many analysts here believe that Senator Church's problem is that he is simply more liberal than his state. The Senator often has to shift roles when he goes home. A few years ago, one of the television networks was taping a show on the Senator in Idaho. He borrowed a sheepskin jacket from a local men's store to look more western and returned the jacket after the television people left. Senator Church says that Idaho voters, after more than a year of being too angry at him to listen to why he voted for the canal treaties, are now listening — even if they are not persuaded. Delight at Refuge for Shah The normally serious Senator appeared overjoyed after Panama gave refuge to the deposed Shah of Iran. “It really couldn't be more fortuitious,” he said, beaming, and issued a news release that said, “This is the first great friendship dividend to flow from the Panama Canal treaty.” A November poll by The Idaho Statesman, a Boise newspaper, gave Mr. Church a I6‐point lead over Represenative Symms and included a wider sampling than a similar poll, taken just a few weeks earlier, that showed him 12 points behind, Representative Symms is a political conservative with a gift for one‐liners reminiscent of Ronald Reagan's. He is a former marine and is a board member of the American Conservative Union. There are two independent committees working to soften up Mr. Church before Mr. Symms announces. The Anybody But Church Committee is affiliated with the National Conservative Committee of Arlington, Va. The Idaho Committee for a Positive Change is headed by Vern Ravenscroft, who ran unsuccessfully as a Republican candidate for Governor, and Helen Nellie Chenoweth, who was Mr. Symms's campaign manager in 1978.

Excerpts from their discussion follow. Marriage Q. How did the decade's changes — some of them perhaps dislocations, some perhaps amenities come home to you? Miss Jong? Miss Jong. Well, the kind of marriage and child‐rearing I'm now engaged in would have been impossible for me when I graduated from college — 1963. We both work at home. We have a 16‐month‐old baby whose care is shared between the two of us equally, and with a nurse. My husband does most of the cooking because he loves to and I'm not a very good cook. But I do other things around the house that are useful. The egalitarianism involved would have been impossible for me in my first marriage. Miss Bergen. For me also, I grew up with a very definite set of expectations, totally centered around being married, having children. I assumed that I would have accomplished all of that by the age of 25. And now, at 33, I find myself stunned to have those expectations so vastly altered — I have not yet gotten married — and (I'm) much more focused on a kind of self‐expression, or a career, or on my friends as a surrogate family. The other day I found myself in a dialogue with my doctor about my fertile years and the incidence of mongolism. I practically went out and got married that night. Yet I'm glad it's happened the way it has. Dr. Gaylin. I think you have to be careful. You”re talking to three exceptional women, who do not represent a norm. What has happened to them could not have happened without the changes. And what has happened to them may — eventually — happen to the average woman. But the changes haven”t been nearly as dramatic in fact as they have been in expectation. Miss Guthrie. Well, of course I have not had children of my own — I”m 41 — and as a matter of fact I would like to. And without the availability of legal abortion I wouldn”t dare, because the incidence of mongolism is just too high. And I may still or I may not. I don”t know. There”s usually been a man in my life and our relationships have always been very egalitarian. They”ve had to put up with quite a bit of racing. And it hasn”t always been easy. But it's worked out pretty well on the whole. For the rest of it, I see bits and pieces that I've regarded as very encouraging — just vignettes, really. A guy in Cheyenne, Wyo., the other day, saying he was glad I existed, and women like me, because he wanted (his two daughters) to grow up with all kinds of opportunities open to them. Q. How much was not having children a choice, or have women gone from having no choice to having a Hobson's choice? Miss Bergen. This may be a real gaffe, but there are many times when I find myself just swamped (by) choices. There are certain days when I feel myself very much a beneficiary of the women's movement and of the 70's, and other days when I feel myself a casualty. Q. What are some of the casualties? Miss Bergen. What I once felt was expected of women has almost diffused into the atmosphere. I no longer know what I'm supposed to do, and what I”m capable of doing. I used to have names for the children. I knew what I wanted to wear in the wedding. For me, it”s an incredible inversion of fantasies. Children Dr. Gaylin. The fact is, whenever you're caught in a transition of values, it's hard, and you sweat. Because even bad rules are comfortable guides to life. The change is extraordinarily beneficial. But I pity the people like yourselves, and my daughters, who are caught in the transition. You were raised in one set of traditions or aspirations, and you adopted, intellectually, another. You're trapped between (them). Q. Miss Guthrie, your choices are now almost typical. Do you feel an anguish of alternatives? Miss Guthrie. Well, yes, no and maybe. I had the benefit and the disadvantage of coming from a somewhat unconventional family. My brothers and sisters and I were brought up very equally. We could do as we chose. And I chose adventures of various sorts. In a way, it was unconscious: I was simply responding to my strong preference to go out and fly the airplanes and see what was over the horizon. Intellectually, as well as physically that's what led me to the study of physics. I rather expected that along the way I would get married and have children. But that was never the No. I goal. Q. Up against that biological deadline, would you have a child without marriage? Miss Bergen. I'm looking at my watch a lot, but I'm riot entertaining it yet because I'd sort of like to go with the whole enchilada. Q. What about the impact on men? They have choices; some choices are thrust upon them. Dr. Gaylin. The interesting thing is that the feminist movement really was a long overdue re‐evaluation of gender stereotypes. Women have always overvalued the real choice that any man has in our culture. We live in a culture of illusions of upward mobility, but there's rarely a man who finds himself a success It's tough because biology. doesn't help us much. But there are certain limits that you can't deny One is that an infant is born at a stage of such incredible helplessness. There has to be a primary caretaker Does it have to be a woman? I don't think necessarily. Then you'd just be changing the definition of a mother. Can it be shared? We don't know. Are we free to experiment? We're free to do anything. We are free animals. Men and Women Q. Are men threatened by both the expression of such views and the facts of your lives? Miss Guthrie. Oh yes. It was pretty clear when I came to Indianapolis in 1976. The hostilities were rampant. And the changes I have seen have been based on their experience running against me. As I started moving up through the ranks and beating them, they became friendlier and friendlier. It's completely different now. Q. Are you still a woman or are you a pal? Miss Guthrie. Well, racing drivers don't sort of hang around in groups together very much. The point I was going to make is that the remaining problems that I have, and I do still have a few, are still coming from the guys that I haven't beaten yet, who are still afraid that the unthinkable is going to happen to them. Dr. Gaylin. It's a funny question: “Can you treat someone as a woman?” There's always resistance to change, particularly if you're in the seat of power. But in my profession women have long been accepted, not only on parity, but there's been a disproportionate number in power. The fact that they were successful and coequals — or your boss — didn't make them less women. That we can redefine a woman's role so it doesn't have to be dependent doesn't necessarily mean that a woman is one of the guys. There can still be sexual attraction and seduction and playfulness. I don't see that the social, economic equity that we're reaching for is going to have to change that. If men are threatened, they'll learn to live with it. Q. The women here seem to say these changes are good for us. Do you bear any guilt or worry? Miss Jong. I'm torn terribly. My intellectual — my best side — knows I'm doing the right thing. But a part of me always would like to stop doing whatever I'm doing and be with my child all the time. And I dare not do that, especially because she's a daughter. She had better have a mother who can combine mothering and work, because that's the main task daughters have in this world. Q. Do the two of you who don't have children now worry whether it would be unfair to mother a child while being committed to a career? Miss Guthrie. I don't think it would be actually possible to mother a child while maintaining a full‐blown racing career. Q. Does it anger you that male race drivers don't have to make that choice? Miss Guthrie. Well, no. One thing you learn in racing is a degree of stoicism. If I had to choose between having a child in September and running at Indianapolis this May, I'd run at Indianapolis. Dr. Gaylin. Let me correct one thing you said about a man can get away with it and woman can't. I asked someone who headed a large law firm in Washington, supposing a young woman came up to you and said, look, I'm a top‐notch graduate, I was in the upper third, I want a job, but I want to tell you I cannot work from 6 A.M. to midnight. I want to be home to take care of my kids. Would you hire her? He said, I'll tell you how it goes. The young man who said I'll work my tail off, night and day, and had the same potential, he's first choice. The second is the woman. But if some man came and said, listen, I believe in the egalitarian marriage, I want to spend half my time raising my children, I'd say get out of here. It's going to be hard, even with men who want to participate in that kind of experiment. Q. What about militant feminism? Is it still a useful knife‐edge to social change or does it raise fears and distort issues? Miss Jong. I don't think there can be an excess of feminism. Every revolutionary movement has a utility because it dramatizes issues. It also makes those issues almost ludicrously black and white. I have been accused of being a counterrevolutionary for having written about love. I think that's silly. But revolutionaries are important to society because they foment changes. And then they bring about counter‐revolutions, unfortunately. And we're in a period like that. We have very right‐wing things happening in a country that is not really right‐wing, as far as abortion is concerned. Most of the adult population believes in reproductive freedom. And yet a small minority is determined to make its will felt. Q. Miss Bergen, do you have any conflict about doing a sensational perfume ad and living the life of a feminist? Miss Bergen. How do you mean sensational? In fact, when we were designing the perfume ad — although you can hardly load a perfume ad there were specific lies I didn't want to tell. You come up against a corporate monolith a lot here. But oh, sure, there's a lot of that in my life that contradicts a party line. Miss Jong. I think every woman who wants to be a completely self‐actualized person and not be locked into her grandmother's way is a feminist. It's a shame that many men — and many women — associate the word feminist with trouble — or antimale. Miss Bergen. If we're talking about a decade and movements, shouldn't we talk about gay movements? It seems to me that that will really carry over into the 80's, and dominate. Q. Do you think that's become a free choice? Miss Jong. I don't happen to agree that every feminist must have a female lover. It's a personal choice, not a political choice. But I do think that after decades of mistreatment of gay people, we should become more aware and this is something that the gay rights movement has done. It's also precipitated a terrible backlash. Q. What about younger people? Dr. Gaylin. I've been teaching the last few years on the undergraduate level, at a sophisticated urban university, Columbia. I'm impressed with how slowly change has filtered down. There is still so much of the same embarrassment. There is more active sexual involvement — although we're not even sure of that. But the differences between them and my generation — I come from the Midwest, really from an inhibited kind of be‐a‐good‐boy… Miss Jong. It was the same in New York. Dr. Gaylin. I'm relieved to know that. I had always felt you flashy sophisticated Easterners were having all the fun. Miss Jong. There's been a lot of sex and very. little liberation, and I think this equating sex with liberation is totally false. Liberation is the way you feel about sex in your mind, not whether you fall into bed with anybody. Miss Bergen. I have a brother who's 18, and it's fascinating to see that on certain levels there is almost more of a conservatism. But I do find a change in the girls. The difference in their generation and ours is that they're incredibly direct — much more aggressive in their wants and their needs, their courting behavior, their seductive behavior. And very often their parents are us — people in their late 30's or older 40's, the older adolescents of the 60's, who raised them under a totally different behavioral code. Boys and Girls Miss Guthrie. Friends of mine who have children m adolescence report that girls feel that they have the perfect social right to call up a guy and ask him out. And, in fact, it has occurred to me that quite a bit of women's passivity has been traceable to the question of who pays. If a woman expects to have the drink bought for her, she cannot ask the man to have a drink. If a woman expects that she will be able to invite and pay, that grants her a degree of freedom she did not previously have. Dr. Gaylin. Despite my surprise at finding the anxieties, I just don't think there's any question that there's been an enormous change in respect for women, for their aspirations. Only, though, if you remember we're talking about an educated, upper‐middle.chiss. If you look in rural, Hispanic, black commuint Miss Bergen. It's true, one forgets we're living on the extreme — t the cultural extreme. Q. Well, is the social class that we've been discussing a vanguard? Dr. Gaylin. In a peculiar way, economics are going to force liberation outside the vanguard, not because of the movement — although the models will help — but in a negative way. In an age of scarcity, women are just going to have to work whether they want to or not. Miss Jong. But women do have to work, in most cases whether they want to or not. Most families cannot survive without two paychecks. Dr. Gaylin. But the concept of work has been romanticized. There is nothing so nifty about working on an assembly line. Miss Jong. I don't think that women envied the work, they envied the pleasure of having a position in the world. Dr. Gaylin. It's the power of being the earner of money and the dispenser of money. Q. What do you think is ahead? Miss Guthrie. Well, women have lost their history all along the way. There have always been achieving women. This is history's greatest weapon: It never happened. In the 30's, Jacqueline Cochran won the Bendix Trophy for the Transcontinental Air Race in the hottest machinery of the time. It was the 70's before we let women into the cockpit of a commercial airliner. All of a sudden the first woman to fly a commercial airliner is — guess what: A freak. Miss Jong. Why are these things forgotten? Miss Guthrie. The society is male‐dominated, and historians, of course, are part of it. And if the society at large wanted to receive and preserve this history, it would. We are not freaks now. We were not freaks then. It seems to come in generations. There were a lot of achieving women in the 30's. And before that it was just after the turn of the century. Q. Are we just in another cycle? Miss Guthrie. Lord, I hope it doesn't cycle down again. Miss Jong. I fear the cycling down. There have (always) been great women writers. And yet the very fact of one's being a woman predisposes the way one is treated to a degree that seems absurd. The pen and the penis are always equated in the conventional metaphors of literary criticism. That seems to me tragic. Miss Bergen. I'm not so specifically political about this, so I don't actually have a very good answer. I know militant feminists and average feminists, who totally backed away from having children, marriages, who now want nothing more. It's also hard for many of them to go back. Because in going through the 70's many of us sacrificed a lot. It's been a decade of definition, of going through a certain revolutionary time, and emerging back at the beginning, when I was making lists at 14 — except that now I'm quite clear about what I think is important. Dr. Gaylin. I'm optimistic. You're not going to go back. There haven't been cycles. There have been periods in which women have been in power, but those have been periods of elitist societies. The process has started. You're admitting 30 percent women now to medical schools, and 35 or 40 percent to law schools. Miss Jong. But every organization that a woman goes into is run according to male assumptions. When you get to the top you see how far from the top it really is. Bedrooms Q. The bedroom — do you think it's a different place than it was a decade ago? Miss Jong. It depends on who you're in the bedroom with. Things have changed for some people but there's been‐far less change than we would like to think. People are not sexually liberated, yet, in this country. That is, they do not regard sex as a normal, healthy part of life. Miss Guthrie. There's a lot of Puritanism left. I'm on the road most of the time. Yet a man who's in a strange city and doesn't know a soul can go into a bar and sit around and talk, and just have some human contact. I can't ; the assumption of sexual availability would be made. Dr. Gaylin. There's a danger of attributing everything to the woman's movement. Sexual behavior has always been strange because often a kind of role reversal goes on there. You have to recognize it was that grand Victorian, Sigmund Freud, that really started that revolution. Miss Jong. A great change is women's belief that they have a right to ask for what they need. Dr. Gaylin. But that's all part of this Freudian revolution; they found out that they were entitled to sexual pleasures. In the 1920's women used to brag about the fact that, while they did their wifely duties, they didn't enjoy it. Q. Have we really gotten beyond that? Miss Guthrie. No, I don't think we have. Just to play with this as an intellectual game, I think it all derives from the patriarchal descent of property and the necessity of the man to be absolutely certain (it) passed to a child who is his. Miss Jong. He hoped. Miss Guthrie. Well, I mean I think that's where much of our repressiveness arises. We have a system in which movies in which people get killed are O.K. for kids to see, but movies in which people have sex are not. There's something wrong with that concept. Dr. Gaylin. You teach a lot o; things to your child by example. Do you want to teach him sex by example? I'm not so sure that there isn't an essential privacy that won't be protected. Q. What about privacy, Miss Bergen? You are, after all, a public person. Miss Bergen. I'd certainly make an effort to protect that. But I read these letters in Penthouse and Playboy. I don't ever seem to meet these people who all wind up (together) in a sleeping bag in Montana. I wonder if some of it is emotional evasiveness under another name and that the ease with which we can have sexual relations precludes the base for friendship. Many of us have experienced a five‐year gambit of a relationship in a weekend. And I find it dangerous and unacceptable. We're a nation of transients as it is, but that makes us emotional transients. Dr. Gaylin. May I make a brief last plea for recognition that a lot of movements have been going on. Some of the stuff that we're blaming on or attributing to feminism has been part of the most individualistic society that I can think of. But no more. We can't, because there's simply scarcity. We're going to be forced again to think of the public space and the common good and lots of things that are very old‐fashioned.

Redefining Individual Rights,https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/30/archives/redefining-individual-rights.html,"In any given term, year after year, the same core issues are somewhere on the United States Supreme Court's docket. I ‐hat is because no matter what the Court rules, debate over the relationship between the individual and the Government, the pleas of the system's outsiders, the availability of the judiciary to provide redress, is never ending. What the Court does from time to time is to redefine the terms of the debate. It did a fair amount of redefining in the 1970's. What follows is a look back at some decisions that are likely to reverberate into the 80's. As with any such list, there are caveats: Opinions that once sounded definitive begin to blur at the edges as time passes and new law accumulates, opinions that once looked minor figure large as Justices weave new doctrine into future cases. The Individual and the State. One such opinion that grew in importance during the 70's was Goldberg v. Kelly (1970), frequently cited as the cornerstone of the “due process revolution.” It held that a state could not cut off welfare payments without first giving the recipient the right to a formal hearing. From it flowed a series of decisions limiting the power of Government to deal unilaterally or arbitrarily with individuals. Courts are still wrestling with the further reaches of Goldberg v. Kelly; at least two cases now before the Supreme Court deal with such issues. Roe v. Wade (1973) forbade the Government to interfere in a woman's decision to have an early abortion, thus ushering in both the era of legal abortion and one of the most vituperative public policy debates of the decade. The issue is again on the calendar for 1980; the question, whether the Government can refuse to fund abortions under Medicaid. In criminal law — in one sense the ultimate conflict between the individual and the state the Court in the 70's made little new law, continuing to adhere to the central premises of leading criminal cases of the 60's. It did examine some new areas. It nullified all existing death penalty laws in Furman v. Georgia and related cases (1972). Four years later, in Gregg v. Georgia, state death laws with specific procedural safeguards were upheld. While the debate is likely to continue, the Court succeeded in narrowing its focus to one of procedural regularity. The press and the state emerged as an area of heightened concern. Branzburg v. Hayes (1972) held that reporters have no constitutional right to refuse to answer grand jury questions about their sources. Nebraska Press v. Stuart (1976) essentially barred prior restraint as a judicial tool for curbing pretrial publicity. Last summer, Gannett v. DePasquale gave trial judges broad discretion to close their courtrooms to the press and public, a discretion that may be further defined and perhaps limited in the Richmond Newspapers case this term. Access to Justice. Who has a right to use the Federal courts, and on what grounds, is both a recurring question and one whose answers are a key to the Court's views both of the role of the courts and of the relationship between state and Federal governments. Twin themes emerged during the 70's that are likely to receive the Court's further attention. Greater deference to the role of the states led to the doctrine of Federal court abstention, announced in Younger v. Harris (1971), which sharp limited the right of individuals who have recourse to state courts to raise constitutional claims in Federal court. At the same time, the Court expanded the grounds for bringing constitutional cases in the first place. The 1971 Bivens case held that people can sue Federal officers directly under the Constitution for violations of the Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search. Last term, Davis v. Passman extended the Bivens analysis to equal protection claims under the Fifth Amendment. In Monell (1978), the Court for the first time made local governments liable to damage suits under one of the key Federal civil rights laws. Discrimination. Having made segregation in the public schools unconstitutional, the Court in The Court writes narrowly, building with shifting coalitions the 70's turned to the scope of available remedies. The 1971 Swann case made busing a permissible tool, a conclusion reaffirmed last term in the Columbus and Dayton cases. But in Milliken v. Bradley (1974), it refused to order busing across city or district lines. That debate, now relatively quiescent, is likely to re‐emerge as housing patterns remain highly segregated. In employment discrimination cases, both race and sex, the Court adhered to an analytic dichotomy that appears to some scholars to he increasingly strained. For cases claiming discrimination prohibited by the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Court applies the rule of its decision in Griggs v. Duke Power (1971). Griggs held that employment practices with a “disparate impact” On blacks or women can constitute discrimination regardless of the employer's good faith. But fmr discrimination cases brought under the Constitution's equal protection clause, the Court in Washington v. Davis (1976) insists that a plaintiff prove not just discriminatory effect, but intent to discriminate. The Court may well attempt to reconcile these differing standards in the next few years. The Bakke decision in 1978, Weber in 1979, and the decision to come this term in Widow v. Kreps all represent the effort to define the permissible limits of remedies for past discrimina• t ion. It is not a debate that will soon lw conclud. ed. The Court writes narrowly on these goes. i ions, building with fragile and shifting cotthI HMS. Which of I hese opinions will endure as law and which only as history remains to be seen"
